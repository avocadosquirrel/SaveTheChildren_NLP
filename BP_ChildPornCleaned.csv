The film, known as ""Cuties"" in English, is directed by French-Senegalese director Maimouna Doucoure, and started streaming September 9. More than 200,000 tweets with the hashtag ""#CancelNetflix"" became the top trending topic one day later. A first wave of criticism, in August, led Netflix to withdraw ""inappropriate"" artwork used to promote the film, which was released in theaters that month in France. Netflix also said it apologised for having used ""inappropriate"" images. But on Thursday, broader opposition to some of the imagery came from around the political spectrum in the United States. DeAnna Lorraine, a former Republican candidate for Congress from California, tweeted that ""Child pornography is illegal in America."" ""As the mother of an 8-year old girl, I STRONGLY support #CancelNetflix,"" added Beatrice Cardenas, another California Republican. The film, which received a director's award at the prestigious Sundance Film Festival, tells the story of Amy, an 11-year-old Parisian, who must juggle the strict rules of her Senegalese family and social media's emphasis on appearance. She joins a dance group formed by three other girls from her neighborhood, whose choreographies are sometimes suggestive. ""The hypersexualization of girls (and boys) is disgusting,"" tweeted Omar Navarro, another Republican politician. ""It is morally and ethically reprehensible. Pedophiles, child rapists and perverts would have a great time with #Cuties."" Contacted by AFP, Netflix did not immediately comment. Among the voices praising the movie were American actress Tessa Thompson (""Creed"", ""Avengers: Endgame""), who found it ""beautiful."" ""It gutted me at @sundancefest,"" she went on. ""It introduces a fresh voice at the helm. She's a French Senegalese Black woman mining her experiences. ""The film comments on the hyper-sexualization of preadolescent girls. Disappointed to see the current discourse. Disappointed to see how it was positioned in terms of marketing. ""I understand the response of everybody. But it doesn’t speak to the film I saw."""

The move aims to turn youths susceptible to online abuse into agents promoting digital literacy among friends. The platform was introduced yesterday by Nuttapon Nimmanphatcharin, president of Depa; Thanakorn Srisuksai, manager of the Thai Media Fund; Marcus Adaktusson, chief corporate affairs officer of DTAC; and Srida Tanta-atipanit, manager of the Internet Foundation for the Development of Thailand. ""One in three kids in Thailand have faced cyberbullying according to a recent survey of 15,348 respondents aged 6-18,"" said Ms Srida. She said 25% of respondents engaged in online meetings and they faced fraud, attempts to lure them into illicit gangs, stalking as well as sexual harassment. The survey found 73% view pornographic content, nearly 50% see child pornography and 5.5% own child pornography, while 12.1% see gambling advertising and 2.8% gamble online. Mr Nuttapon said children own digital devices quite early in Thailand, which is among the top five countries in Asia-Pacific for youth ownership, but they lack sufficient digital literacy. Thai youngsters spend 5-10 hours a day online. He said Thailand needs to fill 40,000 digital skill positions per year, but only 20,000 graduates are able to fill them and 13,000 of them are likely to work in corporations. Referring to children's digital literacy, he said it is important to equip children with this skill to protect them against online abuse. ""Proactive new skill sets are needed as Thailand gears up for digital transformation, particularly in the real sectors,"" said Mr Nuttapon. Mr Adaktusson said young people need to have digital resilience and literacy in order to leverage digital tools for national and social development. ""Youth are on a rapid digital transformation journey that has challenges and opportunities. The Covid-19 outbreak has changed the learning and teaching landscape, with online classes becoming much more common,"" he said. Children can learn about digital literacy via https://learn.safeinternet.camp. The website has topics such as online privacy and sexual abuse, ways to stop cyberbullying and identifying fake news. The digital upskilling course includes artificial intelligence-powered chatbots, data visualisation, storytelling and gamification."

											Russia convicts Gulag historian on sex charge despite outcry

Yury Dmitriyev, the local head of prominent rights group Memorial in Karelia in northwestern Russia, was facing up to 15 years in a penal camp under the charges. His supporters insisted he is being punished for his work digging into Soviet-era abuses. After a trial held behind closed doors, a judge in the city of Petrozavodsk found Dmitriyev guilty of sexually abusing his adopted daughter, sentencing him to three-and-a-half years in prison. His lawyer Viktor Anufriyev told reporters that with time served in pre-trial detention Dmitriyev, 64, would be free in three-and-a-half months. Anufriyev said his client was content with the verdict because ""he knows he is not guilty"".  ""Such a verdict following such serious charges can mean only one thing: the prosecution has no real proof of Dmitriyev's guilt,"" Memorial said in a statement after the decision. ""Nevertheless, these charges have already robbed Yury Dmitriyev of more than three years of freedom and ruined his adopted daughter's life,"" it said. - Decades of research on Gulag - Dmitriyev spent decades locating and exhuming mass graves of people killed under Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin's rule, including in the notorious Gulag network of forced labour camps.  The researcher was first arrested in late 2016 on child pornography charges, and then acquitted in 2018. He was then arrested again on the sexual assault case, charges he has always denied. Memorial argues his prosecution is part of a growing crackdown on dissenters in Russia, and that he was targeted for calling attention to one of the darkest chapters in Russia's history. Dozens of his supporters gathered outside the courtroom on Wednesday and some said the verdict was as close as Dmitriyev could get to an acquittal. Yan Rachinsky, a director at Memorial, said the verdict allowed Russian authorities to save face after a robust public campaign in Dmitriyev's defence. ""On the other hand, it won't see a man die in prison,"" he said.  Fellow historian Anatoly Razumov said the fact that Dmitriyev ""will soon get back to his work is a victory"".  - 'Always grateful'-  Dmitriyev is known for helping open the Sandarmokh memorial in a pine forest in Karelia in memory of thousands of victims -- including many foreigners -- murdered in 1937 and 1938. ""Thanks to Yury Dmitriyev, I know where my grandfather was buried,"" supporter Galina Ivanova said outside the courthouse. ""And this is a huge deal, I will always be grateful to him."" The historian was initially arrested in late 2016 on child pornography charges and spent more than a year in pre-trial detention, before calls by prominent figures resulted in his release. He was acquitted in April 2018. But in a stunning turnabout, he was detained again on assault charges later that year after a higher court overturned the not guilty verdict. Dmitriyev's previous case centred on naked photographs of his then pre-teen adopted daughter seized during a search of his home. Independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta reported that Dmitriyev's cellmates had tried to pressure him into admitting his guilt or face sexual abuse in prison. Speaking in court during his second trial this month, Dmitriyev, who was himself adopted, said he had done everything to raise his daughter to be happy and healthy. In the speech published by the Meduza news portal, he also said it was important for people to remember their past. ""The strength of the state is not in its tanks and guns, in its nuclear rockets or an ability to tell everyone to flip off,"" he said.  ""No, the strength of the state is in its people."""

											Germany's 'Black Forest Rambo' nabbed after six-day manhunt										",https://search.bangkokpost.com/track/visitAndRedirect?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bangkokpost.com%2Fworld%2F1953500%2Fgermanys-black-forest-rambo-nabbed-after-six-day-manhunt&contentId=news1953500,"BERLIN - After a huge six-day manhunt, German police said Friday they have caught the ""Black Forest Rambo"", a heavily armed suspect accused of stealing officers' weapons and going on the run in the woods. Yves Rausch, 31, was found sitting in a bush after a tip-off from two witnesses, ""with four guns visible in front of him"", said Juergen Rieger, the head of the search operation. The suspect also had an axe in his lap and one further gun, and there was a letter in front of him, Rieger said. Rausch was slightly injured in the arrest, as was a member of the special forces who was cut with the axe. ""I am relieved, happy and grateful that this exceptional situation for our town has come to an end,"" Uwe Gaiser, the mayor of the village of Oppenau, told reporters. Rausch had fled into the forest on Sunday after he managed to disarm four police officers, sparking a huge search operation. More than 2,500 officers combed the area with the help of special forces, helicopters, sniffer dogs and thermal imaging cameras for the fugitive, nicknamed ""Black Forest Rambo"" by the German press after pictures emerged of him dressed in combat gear. - 'Weapons freak' - The drama began on Sunday morning when police were informed that a suspicious man was hanging around a hut in the forest near Oppenau. Four officers sent to the scene said he cooperated at first when approached. But then he ""suddenly and completely unexpectedly"" threatened them with a gun and made them put down their own weapons before running away with them. Police had earlier warned that he may also be carrying a bow and arrow.  Oppenau prosecutor Herwig Schaefer described Rausch on Tuesday as a ""weapons freak"" with a ""great affinity for arms"". He has a long criminal record, including charges related to the possession of illegal weapons, theft and bodily injury. He received a juvenile sentence of 3.5 years in 2010 after he shot an acquaintance with a crossbow, seriously injuring her. Police found child pornography on his mobile phone while investigating him for the possession of explosives in 2019. Schools, kindergartens and the local swimming pool were closed on Monday as a precaution. - Swastikas and SS symbols - Investigators initially said they did not suspect any far-right or other political motive for Rausch's behaviour. However, they later revealed he had received an eight-month suspended sentence for incitement to hatred when he was 15 for altering the letters on a sign for a youth organisation so that it read ""Juden weg"" (""Jews be gone""). They also said he had made a fake bomb and was known for anti-Semitic statements as well as the use of swastikas and SS symbols.  Rausch had been homeless since autumn last year and had been squatting in the hut where he was spotted on Sunday. According to a former neighbour who described him as ""not an easy person"", he Rausch did odd jobs as a rail worker and a golf course caretaker, the Bild tabloid reported. Various weapons and petrol canisters were found in his apartment after he was evicted, as well as a small shooting range in the attic, according to Bild. He then reportedly lived in his car by the local swimming pool for a while before moving into the hut at the edge of the forest. Rausch will be examined by a psychiatrist due to the ""gravity of the crime"" and his past history, Schaefer said. In addition, a blood sample will be taken to check whether he was under the influence of drugs or other substances."

Rivera's body was retrieved and an initial examination found no evidence of foul play or suicide, Ventura County Sheriff Bill Ayub told a press conference. ""We are confident the body we found is that of Naya Rivera,"" said Ayub, pointing to the location, appearance, clothing and condition of the body. Her body was being taken to a medical examiner's office for a full autopsy and confirmation of her identity from dental records, though no other missing persons have been reported at Lake Piru, he added. Rivera, 33, is believed to have accidentally drowned after renting the boat with her young son at the camping and recreational hotspot around an hour's drive northwest of Los Angeles. She had vanished on Wednesday afternoon and a massive search involving divers, patrol boats and helicopters was launched shortly after her sleeping son was spotted drifting alone in a boat on the lake. The son later told investigators that Rivera had helped him into the boat before ""he looked back and saw her disappear under the surface of the water"", said the sheriff. Ayub pointed to the lake's strong currents as a possible cause of a fatal accident. ""The idea perhaps being that the boat started drifting -- it was unanchored -- and that she mustered enough energy to get her son back onto the boat, but not enough to save herself,"" he said. The lake has been closed since Wednesday when around 100 personnel, including the US Coast Guard and rescuers from neighbouring counties, joined the search. Search teams used footage from video messaging calls Rivera made from the boat before her disappearance as well as interviews with her son to scour portions of the lake bed for her remains over six days with no success. ""We believe she was concealed within some of the shrubberies on the floor bed of the lake"" before eventually floating to the surface  due to natural decomposition, said Ayub. With less than 30cm of visibility underwater in daylight, the recovery operation was a ""complex search effort"" even with the use of sonar equipment, he said. Rivera was best known for her role as high school cheerleader Santana Lopez in Glee. She starred for six seasons in the wildly popular musical television series set in a US high school that ended in 2015. The Glee cast has been struck by tragedy before. Actor Mark Salling took his own life in 2018, weeks before being sentenced for possession of child pornography. Canadian castmate Cory Monteith died in July 2013 of an overdose of drugs and alcohol."

											Crusading ex-cop's arrest sparks police pushback in Russia
										",https://search.bangkokpost.com/track/visitAndRedirect?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bangkokpost.com%2Fworld%2F1945384%2Fcrusading-ex-cops-arrest-sparks-police-pushback-in-russia&contentId=news1945384,"MOSCOW - When police moved in to arrest Vladimir Vorontsov in May, they didn't bother to knock. Instead, two commando teams stormed the former policeman's top-floor apartment in southeast Moscow at around 7:00 am, one abseiling down the high-rise while the other broke down the door. ""Our daughter thinks that bandits came and took daddy away,"" Aleksandra Vorontsova told AFP, describing the swoop on her husband, an activist for police labour rights. During a five-hour search, investigators even combed through their four-year-old's toys, socks and underwear, she said. Vorontsov, who quit the Moscow police force in 2017 after 13 years, has been charged with extortion. Supporters of the stocky, blue-eyed 35-year-old say that the real reason for his arrest is his Police Ombudsman project, a series of linked social media accounts dedicated to protecting police officers' rights and exposing abuse by their superiors. His case has sparked a rare public outcry among police, a key pillar of President Vladimir Putin's rule, that could eventually spell trouble for the Kremlin, observers say. Vorontsov has spent two months in pre-trial detention and on Thursday a Moscow court extended his arrest until early August. He denies any wrongdoing. With no genuinely independent police trade unions in Russia, Vorontsov's initiative has become popular, attracting more than half a million followers. It has exposed allegations of corruption within law enforcement and denounced pressure on officers to fulfil quotas for fines and arrests. It has also drawn attention to long working hours and suicides in the police force, for which precise figures are not publicly available. Vorontsov has criticised excessive use of force by police and supported claimants' successful legal court cases. For the first time, members of Russia's 750,000-strong police force have openly challenged the authorities over Vorontsov's treatment but also on the functioning and methods of the police, at a time when policing in the United States is under intense scrutiny following the death of George Floyd. Dozens of serving and former police staff in Russia have taken to social media to call for Vorontsov's release. Some posted photos of themselves, others released anonymous pictures of their police hats and protest signs. - 'Crumbling from within' - Several have told AFP that it was important to support Vorontsov despite possible repercussions. Two days after his arrest, former neighbourhood police inspector Georgy Zarya marched to Moscow police HQ for a one-person demonstration -- the only kind allowed in Russia without prior permission -- and held up a sign urging the city's police chief to resign. He was detained for two hours. ""If we don't stand up for Vorontsov now, things will only become worse,"" the 36-year-old said. Zarya quit in late 2018, citing 10- to 12-hour shifts, meagre pay and labour rights' violations. While on the job, he'd made no secret of his disdain for the notorious system of quota-based policing, in which staff are often required to issue a predetermined number of fines or make a certain number of arrests. ""The quota system is the bane of the interior ministry,"" Zarya said. ""If you don't expose an administrative offence, you may not be able to hand in your service weapon in the evening. And how can you go home with a gun?"" he said in an interview. After more than 12 years on the force, Zarya now has nowhere to live as he has not received a housing grant to which he is entitled. Vorontsov has helped him file a lawsuit against the interior ministry. - 'We are Vorontsov' -  Mikhail Tsaplin also spoke out in support of Vorontsov, two weeks before retiring from the police in the town of Gus-Khrustalny, 250 kilometres (155 miles) east of Moscow, after 20 years. Dressed in uniform, he posted a picture of himself on VKontakte, the Russian equivalent of Facebook, with the words: ""I am/We are Vorontsov. I am not afraid."" The 39-year-old criticised Vorontsov's arrest by the Grom (Thunder) police special forces as heavy-handed.  ""He is neither a terrorist, nor an extremist, nor a murderer, nor a child molester,"" he told AFP in a phone interview. Tsaplin retired, he said, because he no longer wanted to be part of a flawed system. ""I can no longer wear a uniform,"" he said. ""I don't like what's happening. The system is crumbling from within."" Tsaplin, who was paid a monthly salary of 43,000 rubles ($620) -- above the average for his region -- said that while ordinary police lived modestly, some senior officers were deeply corrupt and gave the force a bad name. - 'Considered slaves' -  A police investigator from a major Russian city said that he and a colleague had become targets of an internal probe after posting pictures of themselves supporting the activist. He fears he could be fired from the job he ""loves"". The investigator, who spoke to AFP on condition of anonymity, said that Vorontsov was a hate figure for the authorities because he encouraged police to stand up for their rights. ""The government has taken away everything from us,"" he complained, stressing that police officers can be sacked for taking part in demonstrations and that election results in Russia were largely predetermined.  He also said that officers had to obey what he called ""criminal orders"" to break up peaceful rallies, accusing authorities of purposefully pitting police against ordinary citizens. ""Have you ever seen protesting police? No. Are we happy with everything? No,"" he added. All three men said they believed that Vorontsov's arrest was retribution for his work.  They and other critics say police staff often have to buy their own uniforms and office equipment and are forced to accept unpaid overtime and unfair dismissals. Conditions for many are so hard, they say, that dozens of police in Russia commit suicide every year. The interior ministry did not respond to AFP's requests to comment on Vorontsov's activities and detention. But Mikhail Pashkin, head of the Moscow Police Trade Union, seen by some as close to the interior ministry, accused Vorontsov of seeking to make ""big money"" by helping policemen and interfering in politics. ""There are problems in the interior ministry system,"" he acknowledged.  ""On the whole, interior ministry employees are treated very badly. Many superiors consider them slaves rather than humans,"" he told AFP. ""Smart bosses understand that a trade union is not an enemy."" - Powerful enemies - Supporters believe that Vorontsov has made enemies in the upper echelons of the police force and several senior officers have lost their jobs due to his activism. In a well-publicised case, the top policeman in the Siberian region of Novosibirsk, Yury Sterlikov, resigned in April after the Police Ombudsman published a recording in which a senior policewoman was heard ordering her subordinates to issue mass fines for coronavirus lockdown violations to meet a quota.  The policewoman also lost her job after the uproar. Since being arrested, Vorontsov also faces three further probes, including for distributing and producing pornography.  Igor Khudyakov, an ally who helped run the online project, has also been arrested. For some, Vorontsov's project was also an unusual opportunity to express anti-Kremlin views, said a former police major, who spoke to AFP on condition of anonymity. ""There are plenty of those"" who oppose Putin among the police, he said. The president, a 67-year-old ex-KGB officer, has ruled Russia for two decades and could remain in power until 2036 following a controversial vote to amend the constitution. The police, together with the army and security services, form the backbone of his regime. ""It is critically important for the authorities to retain the loyalty of law enforcement,"" said Sergei Davidis, head of a political prisoners' support programme at rights group Memorial. But the pro-Vorontsov campaign, Davidis added, could signal a change in ""public conscience"", as some polls indicate record low approval ratings for Putin in the coronavirus economic slump. His cause has won backing from outside the police too, including prominent Moscow journalist and opposition activist Ilya Azar, who was jailed for 10 days after picketing. Though smaller in scope, the drive in support has drawn comparisons with last year's campaign over investigative journalist Ivan Golunov's detention. Golunov was arrested on trumped-up drugs charges but released after demonstrations. - Support from Navalny -  While Vorontsov has received many plaudits, he has been criticised too, with some police claiming his ""rock-star"" fame has gone to his head. However, even some opponents acknowledge the importance of his work. Vorontsov himself was once a member of the interior ministry's anti-extremism unit, known for harassing anti-Kremlin campaigners.  He set up his Ombudsman project in 2017 while still in the police, driven by a desire to highlight allegations of injustice and violations.  In recent months, he has established close contacts with opposition activists and following his arrest, chief Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny's team urged police officers to keep up the pressure. ""This man was on your side,"" Moscow campaigner and Navalny ally Lyubov Sobol said in a video address.  She told AFP that some police thanked her for sticking up for Vorontsov. In a terse Instagram reaction, interior ministry spokeswoman Irina Volk wrote ""here it comes"", appearing to suggest that the opposition -- whose members often suffer police brutality -- was beginning to flirt with disgruntled officers. Aleksandra Vorontsova said that her husband had anticipated government pressure but hadn't expected it to be so harsh. ""He now understands that they can come for anyone,"" she said. ""He's ready to fight."""

											Online child sex abuse nears record high with coronavirus										",https://search.bangkokpost.com/track/visitAndRedirect?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bangkokpost.com%2Fthailand%2Fgeneral%2F1937644%2Fonline-child-sex-abuse-nears-record-high-with-coronavirus&contentId=news1937644,"Online child sex abuse cases in Thailand are set to hit a record high this year, police said on Thursday, with cybersex predators exploiting the new coronavirus crisis to target more children. The police-led Internet Crimes Against Children (TICAC) taskforce has rescued more than 100 children in the last two months - almost double the 53 victims helped in 2018, which was the highest annual figure since its foundation in 2016. ""Children aren't going to school and criminals are taking advantage of this to look for income during unemployment,"" Thakoon Nimsomboon, head of TICAC, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. The global spread of cheap, high-speed internet and the rise in mobile phone ownership has fuelled cybersex crimes in recent years, with children from Thailand to the Philippines being exploited over livestreams for paying clients worldwide. Officials and activists have seen child cybersex abuse worsen under the coronavirus pandemic as families have struggled to earn a living while children have been at home and online, fuelling calls for better child education on internet safety. Since mid-April, the police taskforce has recovered more than 150,000 files of child sexual abuse material and opened 53 cases. In 2019, they had 72 cases involving 46 victims. ""There is a high possibility that figures this year will reach a record high, especially since officers have time to investigate due to less crime on the streets,"" said Pol Col Thakoon, who is also deputy commander of the anti-trafficking unit. Thailand has ramped up efforts to tackle child sex abuse in recent years, with the 2016 launch of TICAC by the Royal Thai Police, which works hand-in-hand with local non-governmental organisations to track down offenders and their victims. It has 180 officers who hold full-time positions in other police agencies. TICAC has investigated more than 280 cases of internet-facilitated child sexual exploitation since 2016, of which 81 are related to human trafficking. The rest are related to sexual abuse and pornography. Wirawan Mosby, director of the HUG Project, a charity that helps trafficked children, said the government should improve school internet safety policies, especially when children are learning from home. ""Having such high figures is not something to be proud of, and law enforcement is not solving the problem at the root cause,"" she said. Child rights experts are urging Thailand to enact a law that will criminalise grooming of children for sexual abuse, which will help protect them from being sex trafficked. ""Since we don't have this law yet, children need to become victims first in order to press charges (towards the offender),"" said Ms Wirawan. ""This is why we need to focus on prevention and educating children."""

Ressa, 56, and her news site Rappler have been the target of legal action and probes after publishing stories critical of Duterte's policies, including his drug war that has killed thousands. She was allowed to remain free on bail after the ruling pending a possible appeal of the conviction, which carries a jail sentence of up to six years. ""We are going to stand up against any kind of attacks against press freedom,"" Ressa told journalists after the conviction in Manila. Monday's verdict decided a trial that stemmed from a businessman's 2017 complaint over a Rappler story five years earlier about his alleged ties to a then-judge on the nation's top court. Ressa, who Time magazine named as a Person of the Year in 2018, did not write the article and government investigators initially dismissed the businessman's allegation. But state prosecutors later filed charges against her and Reynaldo Santos, the former Rappler journalist who wrote it, under a controversial cyber crime statute aimed at online offences such as stalking and child pornography. The law they are accused of violating took effect in September 2012, months after the article was published. But prosecutors say Rappler's typographical correction to the story in 2014 to change ""evation"" to ""evasion"" was a substantial modification and the article was thus covered by the law. ""I've been the cautionary tale: be quiet or you're next... that's part of the reason why I have been targeted,"" Ressa, a co-founder of Rappler and a former CNN journalist, told AFP in an exclusive interview last week. Duterte's government has said the case is not politically motivated and that authorities must enforce the law, even against journalists.  

 - 'Fake news outlet' - But rights groups and press advocates say the libel charge along with a series of tax cases against Rappler and a government move to strip the news site of its licence amount to state harassment. Amnesty International said the ""attacks"" against Rappler were part of a wider government crackdown on media freedom in the Philippines. Ressa's verdict comes just over a month after government regulators forced off the air ABS-CBN, the nation's top broadcaster, following years of threats by Duterte to shut down the network. Both Rappler and ABS-CBN have reported extensively on Duterte's anti-drugs campaign in which police have gunned down alleged dealers and users in operations condemned by rights groups. Some of the crackdown's highest-profile critics have wound up behind bars, including Senator Leila de Lima, who is serving three years in jail on drug charges she insists were fabricated to silence her. In 2018, Duterte denounced Rappler as a ""fake news outlet"" and subsequently banned Ressa and her colleagues from his public engagements.

The law they are accused of violating took effect in September 2012, months after the article was published. But prosecutors say Rappler's typographical correction to the story in 2014 to change ""evation"" to ""evasion"" was a substantial modification and the article was thus covered by the law. ""I've been the cautionary tale: be quiet or you're next... that's part of the reason why I have been targeted,"" Ressa, a co-founder of Rappler and a former CNN journalist, told AFP in an exclusive interview last week. ""It's a chilling effect... not just to me and to Rappler, but to journalists and to anyone who asks critical questions."" Ressa said she could face up to seven years behind bars if convicted by the judge. A previously cited figure of 12 years was due to her legal team's differing interpretations of the law, she said. Duterte's government has said the case is not politically motivated and that authorities must enforce the law, even against journalists. 'Fake news outlet' But rights groups and press advocates say the libel charge along with a series of tax cases against Rappler and a government move to strip the news site of its licence amount to state harassment. ""If Maria is convicted and locked up for doing her work, the message to other journalists and independent voices is clear: Keep quiet, or you'll be next,"" human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, who is part of Ressa's legal team, wrote in the Washington Post on Friday. Amnesty International said the ""attacks"" against Rappler were part of a wider government crackdown on media freedom in the Philippines. Ressa's verdict comes just over a month after government regulators forced off the air ABS-CBN, the nation's top broadcaster, after years of threats by Duterte to shut down the network. Both Rappler and ABS-CBN have reported extensively on Duterte's anti-drugs campaign in which police have gunned down alleged dealers and users in operations condemned by rights groups. Some of the crackdown's highest-profile critics have wound up behind bars, including Senator Leila de Lima, who is serving three years in jail on drug charges she insists were fabricated to silence her. In 2018 Duterte denounced Rappler as a ""fake news outlet"" and subsequently banned Ressa and her colleagues from his public engagements."

In an exclusive video interview with AFP ahead of Monday's verdict that could see her sentenced for up to 12 years, Ressa admitted being scared but also continued to speak defiantly. ""I've been the cautionary tale: be quiet or you're next... that's part of the reason why I have been targeted,"" said Ressa, 56, the co-founder of news site Rappler and a former CNN journalist. ""It's a chilling effect... not just to me and to Rappler, but to journalists and to anyone who asks critical questions."" Monday's verdict will decide a case that stems from a businessman's complaint in 2017 over a Rappler story five years earlier about his alleged ties to a then-judge on the nation's top court. Government investigators initially dismissed the businessman's allegation. But state prosecutors later revived the case using a controversial cyber crime statute aimed at online offences ranging from stalking to child pornography. Authorities say they have not targeted Ressa for her work and are simply enforcing the law. But press and media watchdogs say the case against Ressa is in retaliation for Rappler's independent reporting on President Rodrigo Duterte and his administration. The website's journalists have cast a harsh light on Duterte's anti-drugs crackdown, which has killed thousands and drawn international censure despite being backed by many Filipinos. Another one of the most prominent critics of Duterte's narco war, Senator Leila de Lima, has been in jail for three years over drug allegations that she says are trumped up. Ressa's libel case is among a string of criminal charges that have hit her and Rappler since last year, many of which stem from allegations over how the site raised investment money. The multiple moves against Rappler have drawn international concern and made Ressa a cause celebre globally for people standing up against authoritarian governments. Time magazine named Ressa a Person of the Year in 2018. Rights watchdogs say the Duterte government has in recent weeks stepped up its campaign to silence dissent in other ways, with the nation's top broadcaster -- ABS-CBN -- shutdown. Lawmkers also this month passed the Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020, which allows warrantless arrests, weeks of detention without charge and other measures that critics fear could be used to crack down on peaceful government opponents. Ressa said Duterte had cemented himself as the most powerful Filipino leader since dictator Ferdinand Marcos, whose two decades in power ended in a famous ""people power"" uprising in 1986. ""We could even say more powerful than Marcos because he (Duterte) was able to declare martial law without even declaring martial law,"" Ressa said, referring to the Anti-Terrorism Act. Ressa, who served as CNN's bureau chief in Manila and Jakarta during a nearly 35-year career, said waiting for Monday's verdict was proving an emotional challenge. ""I am going to embrace my fear. I have to be ready and that starts in my head. That starts with my ability to be okay with the worst-case scenario,"" she said from her Manila home. ""I don't want to be surprised."" The independence of the judicial system in the Philippines, which has long had a reputation for corruption, has been further eroded during Duterte's four years in power, according to rights groups. But Ressa said individual people who make up the court system and their desire ""to be guided by the spirit of the law"" still give her reason for optimism. Regardless of the pressure from the highest levels of power to convict, it is up to the judge to make the final decision. ""I'm hoping. All I can do is hope,"" Ressa said.

The arrest came after the US' CyberTipline Report alerted Thai police to the offence, said Pol Lt Gen Jaruwat Waisaya, assistant national police chief. Pol Lt Gen Jaruwat said the US watchdog had reported someone in Thailand had tweeted 12 still and moving images of child pornography with a mobile phone. He said investigators found the owner of the mobile phone number was Nu, an assistant village headman in Ban Rai district, Uthai Thani province. Officers found child pornography on two mobile phones belonging to Mr Nu on Saturday, he sid. The suspect reportedly admitted to owning the phones and using them to record and upload clips and images of sexual activities with his daughter. Mr Nu said his daughter has been raised by her grandparents after he and his wife divorced. In December 2019, his daughter would come and stay with him a few times every month, at which point he had begun to molest her. Mr Nu was charged with possession of child pornography while officers investigate further. Meanwhile, another rape suspect was arrested in Bangkok yesterday for an offence which took place in 2005. The 36-years-old was charged with abducting a minor, rape and assault. The victim, then 16, was the daughter of a restaurant owner to whom the suspect used to deliver cooking gas, according to police. In Chon Buri, a 22-year-old man was arrested over the gang rape of a 14-year-old girl in 2016. He denied the charge, saying he was too drunk to participate. The suspect, Thanawin Utamo, and seven other men were part of a street racing gang which allegedly raped the girl at a local hotel.

The December 6 attack by Mohammed Alshamrani, a Royal Saudi Air Force flight student at the Naval Air Station Pensacola in Florida, ""was actually the culmination of years of planning and preparation,"" said FBI Director Christopher Wray. Evidence discovered on an encrypted cell phone shows he was radicalized at least as far back as 2015, and has since been associating with ""dangerous"" operatives from the Yemen-based Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), Wray added. The FBI and Justice Department revealed their findings after a months-long effort to crack the encryption on Alsahamrani's iPhones, which they said Apple refused to help with. US Attorney General Bill Barr accused Apple of putting its own financial interests ahead of the nation's. ""If not for our FBI's ingenuity, some luck, and hours upon hours of time and resources, this information would have remained undiscovered,"" Barr said. ""The bottom line: our national security cannot remain in the hands of big corporations who put dollars over lawful access and public safety. The time has come for a legislative solution,"" he said. - Discussed plans and tactics - Wray said the 21-year-old Saudi had expressed a desire to learn to fly years ago with plans for a ""special operation,"" enlisting in the Royal Saudi Air Force and joining flight training in the United States. ""In the months before the attack, while he was here among us, he talked with AQAP about his plans and tactics -- taking advantage of the information he acquired here, to assess how many people he could try to kill,"" Wray said. The December 6 shooting in a classroom building at the naval base left three US sailors dead and wounded eight other people, including two responding sheriff's deputies, before Alshamrani was killed by police. AQAP claimed responsibility, but there was no immediate evidence of a direct link. The incident forced the temporary freeze of all US training for foreign military officials to review security precautions. The decades-old US-Saudi training program has been crucial to the close relationship, with thousands of Saudis undergoing military training in the United States. The US expelled 21 of Alshamrani's classmates for reasons including that some had allegedly been aware of his radical leanings and others possessed jihadist material and child pornography. The program has since resumed, but with heavier vetting of Saudi students, and a ban on them accessing firearms. - Continuing Qaeda threat - The December attack indicated that, far from being eliminated with the killing of founder Osama Bin Laden in 2011, Al-Qaeda remains a potent threat, able to project its threat beyond the Middle East, according to experts. If directed by AQAP, Alshamrani's attack would be the first successful Al-Qaeda-organized assault on the United States since the September 11, 2001 attacks, said David Sterman, a senior policy analyst at the New America think tank. All the successful attacks in the country since then have been organized locally by people inspired or encouraged by al-Qaeda and the Islamic State group, but not organized by them. ""Is this the sign of an existing external plotting capability in Yemen that continues?"" Sterman asked. Even so, he noted: ""One deadly foreign-directed attack in 19 years is a relatively high level of success for the US."""

Acting on an arrest warrant by the Criminal Court, the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Division (ATPD) and the Thailand Internet Crimes Against Children (TICAC) Task Force arrested Natthawut Klinhom, 20, a Chiang Mai native. Mr Natthawut has been charged with extortion. According to the authorities, the victim, 19, filed a complaint against Mr Natthawut, accusing him of blackmail. The victim said he met Mr Natthawut, who posed as a woman, online and the two started a romantic relationship on social media. He said Natthawut started asking for nude photos and he obliged. However, Mr Natthawut then began extorting money while threatening to release the pictures if the victim refused to pay. The student initially paid, but he could no longer do so after spending 19,000 baht to prevent Natthawut from publishing the photos. The victim then filed the complaint with police, which led to Mr Natthawut’s arrest. The authorities raided Mr Natthawut’s home in the province and found the student’s photos on a computer and mobile phones. Mr Natthawut reportedly confessed, saying he committed the crime for the money. In addition, ATPD and TICAC law enforcement agents arrested Piyawat Benjawan, 40, for allegedly possessing child porn in his possession. Pol Maj Gen Weerachon Boonthawee, investigation chief of provincial police bureau 5, said the TICAC was informed by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation that an individual in Thailand had downloaded large quantities of pornography involving minors. Police nabbed Mr Piyawat at his home in Chiang Mai. Mr Piyawat reportedly confessed he downloaded pictures of underage girls because he was bored while under self-isolation. Pol Maj Gen Weerachon noted that it is illegal to download nude photos of individuals under the age of 18."

											Facebook Cancels Gatherings With 50 or More People Through June 2021										",https://search.bangkokpost.com/track/visitAndRedirect?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bangkokpost.com%2Fbusiness%2F1902270%2Ffacebook-cancels-gatherings-with-50-or-more-people-through-june-2021&contentId=news1902270,"Facebook Inc. is canceling all gatherings with 50 or more people through June 2021, Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said Thursday in a post outlining a cautious return for the social media giant from the coronavirus disruption. Mr. Zuckerberg, writing on his personal Facebook page, said the majority of his employees will continue working from home through at least the end of May, with some exceptions possible for employees whose jobs make it difficult to work remotely, such as engineers working on complex hardware and some content reviewers. He said that employees who feel the need will be allowed to work from home through at least the summer. Mr. Zuckerberg's remarks present a very measured reemergence by one of the world's most influential companies when many businesses and government leaders are deliberating over the exit path from the coronavirus shutdown. The CEO said Facebook was slowing its plans to return to the office and ""overall, we don't expect to have everyone back in our offices for some time."" ""We know that most people can't work from home as easily as many of our employees can,"" Mr. Zuckerberg wrote. ""We also know that when society does eventually start re-opening, it will have to open slowly in staggered waves to make sure that the people who are returning to work can do so safely and that we minimize the possibility of future outbreaks."" Major technology companies were some of the first in the nation to have their employees work from home and cancel large in-person events. Facebook in March recommended employees stay home when feasible but blocks of its staff remained at the office for work deemed too sensitive to perform remotely, such as reviewing videos or images related to child abuse or pornography. Conferences planned by Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc.'s Google and others have largely been postponed or canceled due to the virus outbreak. Apple Inc. shut all its stores outside China in mid-March. Facebook, which earlier this year canceled the in-person part of its F8 developers conference for May, guaranteed that such gatherings at the company won't take place until more than a year later. Facebook employs roughly 45,000 people, most based at its headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. The company also uses more than 15,000 contractors to help it police its platform. California residents have been under a statewide stay-at-home order since March 19. Gov. Gavin Newsom this week said there was no specific timeline for loosening the measures. In his post Thursday, Mr. Zuckerberg acknowledged that Facebook is in a position to continue having most of its employees stay at home. Much of the company's workforce can do their jobs behind a computer screen, and Facebook has the infrastructure and capacity to operate remotely. As a pioneer of online communication and virtual gatherings, it is suited for working in the pandemic. Mr. Zuckerberg said Facebook has also extended a ban on business travel through at least June. He wrote that in lieu of large, in-person gatherings the company will hold some events virtually. ""I hope this helps contain the spread of Covid-19 so we can keep our communities safe and get back up and running again soon,"" he said."

Speaking at the ""Protecting Children from Online Sexual Exploitation"" seminar held by Thai Media Fund, Pol Capt Khemachart Prakaihongmanee, deputy director of the Bureau of Foreign Affairs and Transnational Crime at the Department of Special Investigation, said Thailand was experiencing a surge in paedophile activity, with predators orchestrating and watching abuse on live-streaming sites and via webcams, and paying for it with near-untraceable cryptocurrency. ""Paedophiles can now use an array of mobile and online tools -- including social networks, video-sharing sites and the dark web -- to direct and watch child rape and sexual abuse anonymously,"" he said. ""It's live, nothing is recorded ... everything is encrypted. They sometimes pay in bitcoins, or encrypted money, which makes their transactions secure,"" he added. Pol Capt Khemachart also said that easy access to the net and money transfer services make Thailand a global hotspot for paedophilia. According to data from the Digital Economy and Society Ministry, about 70% of the Thai population either owns or has access to a smartphone, while an estimated 67% of Thais also have access to the internet. A study in 2018 showed that Thais aged between eight and 12 spend up to 35 hours per week on the net, which is three hours more than the global average, and that 60% of them are at risk of being exploited via online platforms. Pol Capt Khemachart said that though many websites with child abuse content have been tracked down by Thai authorities and foreign agencies, he believes there is still a ""phenomenal"" number of sites run by paedophiles on the so-called dark net. The dark net has networks that can only be accessed using specific software that re-routes connections through several servers, allowing users to remain anonymous. Websites on the dark net are not indexed, which means they do not appear when looked for with a search engine like Google. ""Paedophiles sit somewhere in the dark net and access the internet to release material. The harder we work to remove the content, the harder they make it for us to find them,"" he said. ""There is still a phenomenal amount of questionable content out there.""

He said Thailand should also consider recruiting more women to the police force. Pol Col Sarawut Khonyai, deputy commissioner of the Provincial Police Region 6, said that while the internet offers a seemingly unlimited supply of potential victims, it also provides paedophiles a way of making money through the sale of sexually explicit photos and videos. ""This economic opportunity has created a new demographic of abusers, people who do not abuse children for personal pleasure, but do it to make money. Since the sale and purchase of child pornography is a crime, the money offered on the black market is quite high,"" he said. Pol Col Sarawut said this places a huge burden on the government and schools, working to make children aware of the dangers of sexual abuse and online sex trafficking, teaching them to protect themselves and notifying authorities of suspicious behaviour. Siriwan Vongkietpaisan, director of the Social Responsibility Legal Advocacy Work, said the media can play a key role in getting the public to understand the changing patterns of child abuse, though they must be very careful when reporting as it can distress the victim."

WhatsApp, acquired by Facebook in 2014, has grown into one of the most widely used services in the Facebook ""family"" of apps, offering free messaging along with voice and video calls. ""Private conversations that once were only possible face-to-face can now take place across great distances through instant chats and video calling,"" a WhatsApp blog post said. ""There are so many significant and special moments that take place over WhatsApp and we are humbled and honored to reach this milestone."" The statement said WhatsApp remained committed to its ""strong encryption"" that enables users to connect privately even amid calls by law enforcement in the United States and elsewhere to provide more access. ""Strong encryption is a necessity in modern life. We will not compromise on security because that would make people less safe,"" WhatsApp said. ""For even more protection, we work with top security experts, employ industry leading technology to stop misuse as well as provide controls and ways to report issues -- without sacrificing privacy."" Last week, child protection organizations called on Facebook to halt plans for strong encryption of all its platforms, saying that would allow predators to operate freely. WhatsApp employs ""end to end encryption"" which can in many cases prevent law enforcement from accessing user data even with a court order. The social network is working to extend end-to-end encryption across its messaging applications, including Facebook Messenger and Instagram. Back door dilemma Child protection groups have expressed fears that stronger encryption of online exchanges would facilitate the sharing of child pornography. Backers of strong encryption argue that any special access or ""backdoors"" allowed for law enforcement would weaken security and could be exploited by criminals, hackers and authoritarian governments. Officials from the US, Britain and Australia late last year called on Facebook to allow authorities to circumvent encryption to better fight extremism, child pornography and other crimes. The heads of Facebook's WhatsApp and Messenger, Will Cathcart and Stan Chudnovsky, responded in a letter to officials from the three countries that allowing this kind of ""backdoor"" access ""would be a gift to criminals, hackers and repressive regimes"" while leaving users vulnerable. Facebook's stance on encryption has been backed by more than 100 activist organizations, security experts and industry groups who warned against efforts to force tech companies to weaken encryption. Despite its strong encryption, WhatsApp has seen flaws exploited in cyberspace. Human rights activists have said that spyware hidden in WhatsApp messages, possible developed by Israel-based NSO Group, was used to track dissidents and others. Amazon chief Jeff Bezos's phone is also believed to have been infected by spyware hidden in a WhatsApp message from Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman. WhatsApp in October sued NSO Group, accusing it of using the messaging service to conduct cyberespionage on journalists, human rights activists and others. Breakup? WhatsApp is one member of the Facebook app ""family"" that includes its core social network, Instagram and Messenger. Facebook said recently some 2.89 billion people globally are daily users of at least one of these services. But the growth has also attracted attention of regulators and activists concerned over the dominance of major tech platforms. Presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren has been among those calling for the breakup of the big technology firms. Facebook has argued against the idea of a breakup, saying the company is better able to keep its services safe and secure with a unified infrastructure."

""Strong encryption is a necessity in modern life. We will not compromise on security because that would make people less safe,"" WhatsApp said. ""For even more protection, we work with top security experts, employ industry leading technology to stop misuse as well as provide controls and ways to report issues -- without sacrificing privacy."" Last week, child protection organizations called on Facebook to halt plans for strong encryption of all its platforms, saying that would allow predators to operate freely. WhatsApp employs ""end to end encryption"" which can in many cases prevent law enforcement from accessing user data even with a court order. The social network is working to extend end-to-end encryption across its messaging applications, including Facebook Messenger and Instagram. The child protection groups said they were concerned that stronger encryption of online exchanges would facilitate the sharing of child pornography. Backers of strong encryption argue that any special access or ""backdoors"" allowed for law enforcement would weaken security and could be exploited by criminals, hackers and authoritarian governments. WhatsApp is one member of the Facebook app ""family"" that includes its core social network, Instagram and Messenger. Facebook said recently some 2.89 billion people globally are daily users of at least one of these services. But the growth has also attracted attention of regulators and activists concerned over the dominance of major tech platforms. Presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren has been among those calling for the breakup of the big technology firms."

Police apprehended Suchart Charoenphol, 37, in front of a school in Muang district of Suphan Buri on Thursday night. He was wanted on an arrest warrant issued by the Suphan Buri Provincial Court on charges of sexually molesting a 16-year-old girl and human trafficking by producing or distributing child pornography for sexual exploitation. The arrest followed a tip-off that porn videos and other material had been put on sale on social media by Facebook user “Lerk Khui Thang Amphor’’ via his Facebook messenger, Pol Col Apisant Chairat, a superintendent of the Anti-Human Trafficking Suppression Division, said on Friday. Anti-human trafficking police investigated and later an undercover officer posing as a customer ordered a video from the Facebook user, who  gave a bank account in the name “Suchart Charoenphol’’ for  payment. The girl in the video was found to be a Mathayom Suksa 4 (Grade 10) student in Suphan Buri.  Investigators brought in officials from the Ministry of Social Development and Human Security to help the girl, Pol Col Apisant said. The girl told officials she had met Mr Suchart through Twitter. They had chatted at first and over time became close. One day, he picked her up on his big bike after she attended a tutorial course. He said he would take her on a tour around, but they ended up in a love hotel where he sexually abused her. He also videotaped sexual acts and took still photos. Afterwards, she was fearful and ashamed, and dared not tell anyone what happened. Investigators obtained court approval to arrest Mr Suchat,  Pol Col Apisant said they found pornographic videos and stills of the 16-year-old victim on his mobile phone. Mr Suchart allegedly confessed to all charges and was held in police custody for legal action. He was suspected of having preyed on other girls and the investigation was continuing, Pol Col Apisant said.  Police show an arrest warrant to suspect Suchart Charoenphol, 37, blue shirt, for alleged sexual abuse of a girl, 16, and videotaping it for sale on social media.

											Encryption battle reignited as US govt at loggerheads with Apple										",https://search.bangkokpost.com/track/visitAndRedirect?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bangkokpost.com%2Fworld%2F1836179%2Fencryption-battle-reignited-as-us-govt-at-loggerheads-with-apple&contentId=news1836179,"WASHINGTON - Apple and the US government are at loggerheads for the second time in four years over unlocking iPhones connected to a mass shooting, reviving debate over law enforcement access to encrypted devices. Attorney General Bill Barr said Monday that Apple failed to provide ""substantive assistance"" in unlocking two iPhones in the investigation into the December shooting deaths of three US sailors at a Florida naval station, which he called an ""act of terrorism."" Apple disputed Barr's claim, while arguing against the idea of ""backdoors"" for law enforcement to access its encrypted smartphones. ""We reject the characterization that Apple has not provided substantive assistance in the Pensacola investigation,"" the company said in a statement. ""Our responses to their many requests since the attack have been timely, thorough and are ongoing."" Late on Tuesday, President Donald Trump weighed in on Twitter, saying the government was helping Apple on trade issues ""yet they refuse to unlock phones used by killers, drug dealers and other violent criminal elements."" ""They will have to step up to the plate and help our great Country, NOW!"" he added. The standoff highlighted the debate between law enforcement and the tech sector about encryption -- a key way to protect the privacy of digital communications, but which can also make investigations difficult, even with a court order. The latest battle is similar to the dispute between Apple and the US Justice Department after the December 2015 mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, when the iPhone maker rejected a request to develop software to break into the shooter's iPhone. That fight ended in 2016 when the government paid an outside party a reported $1 million for a tool that circumvented Apple's iPhone encryption. Barr last year called on Facebook to allow authorities to circumvent encryption to fight extremism, child pornography and other crimes. The social network has said it would move ahead with strong encryption for its messaging applications. - Opening wrong doors? Digital rights activists argue that any privileged access for law enforcement would weaken security and make it easier for hackers and authoritarian governments to intercept messages. ""We have always maintained there is no such thing as a backdoor just for the good guys,"" Apple's statement said. ""Backdoors can also be exploited by those who threaten our national security and the data security of our customers."" Apple and others argue that digital ""breadcrumbs"" make it increasingly easy to track people, even without breaking into personal devices. The government's latest demand ""is dangerous and unconstitutional, and would weaken the security of millions of iPhones,"" Jennifer Granick of the American Civil Liberties Union said in a statement. ""Strong encryption enables religious minorities facing genocide, like the Uighurs in China, and journalists investigating powerful drug cartels in Mexico, to communicate safely."" Granick added that Apple cannot allow the FBI access to encrypted communications ""without also providing it to authoritarian foreign governments and weakening our defenses against criminals and hackers."" Kurt Opsahl of the Electronic Frontier Foundation echoed that sentiment, saying Apple ""is right to provide strong security"" for its devices. ""The AG (attorney general) requesting Apple re-engineer its phones to break that security is a poor security trade-off, and imperils millions of innocent people around the globe,"" Opsahl tweeted. James Lewis of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank, said he believes it's possible to allow law enforcement access without sacrificing encryption. ""You're not weakening encryption, you're making it so it's not end-to-end,"" Lewis told AFP. ""It means that there's a third party who can look at it under appropriate authority."" But Lewis said he does not expect either side to come out a winner in the battle, and that US officials will likely find another outside party to crack the two iPhones belonging to the shooter, Royal Saudi Air Force 2nd Lieutenant Mohammed Saeed Alshamran, who died in the attack. ""It's a repeat of the movie we saw in San Bernardino,"" he said. ""It's going to be harder because Apple probably fixed the trick that worked in San Bernardino."""
22,2020-01-10 04:01:00,It's always funny until someone gets hurt,https://search.bangkokpost.com/track/visitAndRedirect?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bangkokpost.com%2Flife%2Fsocial-and-lifestyle%2F1832449%2Fits-always-funny-until-someone-gets-hurt&contentId=news1832449,"The seriousness of bullying among schoolchildren was brought into sharp focus recently, after a 13-year-old boy shot his classmate, killing him at their school. The young shooter claimed that this was in retribution for the bullying he had suffered at the hands of his dead classmate, who used to hit him, call him gay and otherwise shame him in front of others. In another incident, an 11-year-old girl tried to commit suicide by hanging herself in the school toilet. Her father reported that she had been bullied and teased, sometimes violently, for being poor and having dark skin. Many people still try to pass off bullying among the young, whether it be teasing or fighting, as simply child's play. But, as can be seen from these two incidents which happened just last month, bullying can lead to devastating outcomes, especially when the problem is allowed to escalate without proper intervention from adults. According to statistics, about one-third of children suffer from bullying, says adolescent medicine specialist Dr Jiraporn Arunakul from Ramathibodi Hospital. ""Many children feel they have no way out, and the adults in their lives can sometimes be unreliable. When adult assistance and intervention is ineffective, some [in extreme circumstances] run away from home. Some fight back, even using weapons. Some choose to put up with it. But bullying doesn't just affect the victims, it also affects the bullies themselves,"" said Dr Jiraporn. One in eight bullies grow up to become criminals in adulthood, she explained. A child may be bullied for many reasons: physical appearance, family background, gender identity and expression, and others. But what makes a child start bullying another? There are actually a number of potential contributing factors. ""Some children enjoy bullying. They will have seen adults playing pranks or teasing children, then laughing, and think it's a fun thing that they can do too,"" explained Dr Jiraporn. ""Some lack empathy and understanding of things like diversity. Society teaches them strict standards they have to adhere to. Girls have to be white and pretty, for example, and if anyone strays from these standards, then children may see them as abnormal, and start teasing them as a result."" Some kids may feel powerless and oppressed at home and so decide to exercise their power at school. They bully others to feel better about themselves. For others, bullying may stem from personal or mental shortcomings, such as a short attention span, impaired social skills or lack of self control. They don't know how to play or socialise with others, and compensate by teasing or playing pranks. When faced with school bullying, teachers and parents tend to respond with a punishment. Dr Jiraporn says this is generally ineffective. Punishment may scare the bully into ceasing their actions temporarily, but most will soon revert to bullying, some to a worse degree than before. This can then result in the victims being so intimidated that they stop telling others about the bullying for fear of making things worse for themselves. ""In that situation, teachers think the problem is solved. But in reality, the kids just don't dare to speak up anymore,"" she said. So, it's not only victims that need help, but also bullies. To really get them to change their behaviour, it is crucial to find what is causing it in the first place. First and foremost, this needs to start at home. Children must be taught to have empathy and respect for diversity and the rights of others. ""Bullying is a violation of people's rights,"" Dr Jiraporn stressed. ""We need to teach children that if they bully a classmate, even though they might enjoy it, the other person doesn't, and it is a violation."" Parents have to set examples and not be bullies themselves. ""Some parents call their kids names like 'fatty', for example. The children would then come to see this as normal."" With schools being places where children spend a major part of their day and also where bullying usually takes place, they must play a leading role. Ideally, schools need to have a clear policy that they won't tolerate any form of bullying, with proper rules and guidelines in place to systematically help troubled children. Students that bully others need to be assessed to find out why they behave in this way. A system should also be implemented where victims or witnesses of bullying can safely report incidents to teachers. Some schools in Thailand have already implemented some of these measures. One is Wat Preng School, a state-run primary school with around 400 students in Samut Prakan. Nakarin Aeknigron, a teacher from the school's student welfare department, said that bullying does occur within the school grounds, but this is mostly teasing and calling others names -- nothing too serious, though there are ""a lot of small cases"" to solve. When incidents take place, student welfare and homeroom teachers step in. ""We don't punish them, but rather reason with them and explain that their actions upset others. Then we get them to apologise,"" said Nakarin. ""Should things get out of hand, we take it to the school director and invite the parents to come to the school to inform them and try to work out a solution together."" The students are generally empathetic, he said, and this can be fostered. There are ""third gender"" students, as well as students with autism and Down's syndrome, all studying together in the school. Students are encouraging and understanding of their peers. LGBTI students are accepted. Since the shooting and suicide attempt made headlines, Nakain said the school director Prawatpong Rodklang had a talk with the entire school, encouraging students to play nicely with one another, teachers to educate them how and parents to increase supervision at home. However, looking out for students today shouldn't stop at the playground or classroom, Nakarin continued. Teacher supervision may now have to extend to social media, especially chat groups on applications like Facebook and Line. ""We may not allow children to bring their phones to school, but once they go home, they go online and converse in chat groups, where troubles sometimes manifest."" Some of the problems he has found include anything from fighting, using vulgar words, jealousy, sharing pornography and others. We need to remind ourselves we're talking about primary schoolchildren here. When such things happen, Nakarin says that well-meaning students usually inform him and invite him into the group, where he will then try to teach them how to use social media properly and prevent the problem from escalating. Dr Jiraporn approves, saying that friends and witnesses to bullying may be more important than some realise when it comes to dealing with these issues. They can step in to protect the victims and report to teachers. Ever since the aforementioned high-profile incidents took place, society has been pointing fingers at the usual scapegoats, such as video games and other media, for turning kids violent. ""Everything in a child's surroundings has an effect on them,"" Dr Jiraporn explained. ""This includes video games. There have been studies suggesting that games can influence a child's tendency to become violent. However, this doesn't mean all games affect everyone the same way."" In addition to games, violence on TV and in films may serve to normalise it in children's eyes. The last frontier is social media. ""Children today grow up in a society where people can freely make hurtful comments online. How can they not absorb that?"" Others blame it all on weapons. And while Dr Jiraporn refrained from commenting on whether it is too easy for people to access firearms, she did imply that they are not the cause of violence. ""It's rather straightforward. If adults have easy access to weapons, so will children,"" she said. The following are some suggestions by Dr Jiraporn for adults to help children cope with bullying: Listen to what children have to say and how they feel. Don't listen only to tell them what to do. Don't pass bullying off as a small issue or tell them to simply put up with it. Bullying shouldn't be tolerated. Always reassure them that they can rely on adults. Ask them how they think they should handle the problem and allow them, within reason, to try their solutions. Make them realise they have a choice. Let them try to solve it first. Take the necessary actions when children can no longer feel they can handle it."

											Pope lifts 'pontifical secret' for sex abuse cases										",https://search.bangkokpost.com/track/visitAndRedirect?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bangkokpost.com%2Fworld%2F1818279%2Fpope-lifts-pontifical-secret-for-sex-abuse-cases&contentId=news1818279,"VATICAN CITY: Priests can no longer cite papal secrecy in abuse cases, the Vatican said Tuesday, the latest move by Pope Francis to combat silence surrounding paedophilia in the Roman Catholic church. The Church has been rocked by thousands of reports of sexual abuse around the world by priests, and accusations of cover-ups by senior clergy. Francis' latest instructions regarding Vatican law on sexual abuse say that the pontifical secret no longer applies ""to accusations, trials and decisions"" involving such cases. Pontifical secrecy is a rule of confidentiality designed to protect sensitive information related to Church governance, such as diplomatic correspondence, personnel issues and alleged crimes. Critics say the secrecy laws have prevented priests and victims from reporting abuse, as well as hindered national justice systems prosecuting cases. The Vatican also announced on Tuesday that it was raising the age at which sexual images of a person were deemed child pornography from 14 to 18. In May, the pope passed a landmark measure to oblige those who know about sex abuse to report it to their superiors, a move expected to bring even more cases to light. In Tuesday's statement, issued on the Argentine pontiff's 83rd birthday, Francis spelt out the new obligations. ""The person who files the report, the person who alleges to have been harmed and the witnesses shall not be bound by any obligation of silence with regard to matters involving the case,"" he wrote. Archbishop of Malta Charles Scicluna, the Vatican's chief sex crime investigator, called Francis' move an ""epochal decision that removes obstacles and impediments."" He told the official Vatican News website that ""the question of transparency now is being implemented at the highest level."" The pope has vowed an ""all-out battle"" against sex abuse within the Church, but some victims' groups have said concrete measures have been slow in coming. Marie Collins, a child sexual abuse survivor who in 2017 resigned from a Vatican committee she said was failing to adequately tackle paedophilia, welcomed the pope's latest move. ""Excellent news,"" Collins wrote on Twitter, saying the committee had recommended the step. ""At last a real and positive change."" Despite the lifting of papal secrecy, Francis qualified that discretion in sexual abuse cases was still required. Information pertaining to such cases should be treated, ""in such a way as to ensure its security, integrity and discretion... for the sake of protecting the good name, image and privacy of all persons involved,"" the pope wrote. But that should not obstruct the law, the obligation to report abuses and the carrying out of requests by law enforcement, the instructions said."

Dorsey on Tuesday announced he would fund an independent team of five architects, engineers, and designers -- dubbed Bluesky -- to develop an ""open and decentralized standard for social media."" In a series of posts, he explained the goal is for Twitter to ultimately be subject to this new standard, which would be open to adoption by fellow social media networks like Facebook or TikTok. ""We're facing entirely new challenges centralized solutions are struggling to meet,"" Dorsey said.  Those range from rooting out disinformation and detecting violent content -- hate speech or child pornography -- to the fact today's algorithms tend to direct users' toward content ""that sparks controversy and outrage.""  ""Centralized enforcement of global policy to address abuse and misleading information is unlikely to scale over the long-term without placing far too much burden on people,"" Dorsey said. But he argues a single technical standard shared across different platforms -- which currently operate like walled gardens -- could be a game changer. A shared new standard could curb the power of tech giants to determine what content goes viral -- putting individual users in control. It could also theoretically hand users back control of their data -- currently stored and monetized by private platforms, typically through advertising. Dorsey argued that the value of social media was increasingly shifting away from content hosting and removal, and towards recommendation algorithms. ""Unfortunately, these algorithms are typically proprietary, and one can’t choose or build alternatives. Yet,"" he wrote. An open standard, Dorsey said, would allow Twitter to focus on building recommendation algorithms that ""promote healthy conversation."" He also said the team would also seek to ""build open community"" around the new standard, to include companies and organizations, researchers and civil society leaders. ""This isn't going to happen overnight,"" Dorsey conceded. ""It will take many years to develop a sound, scalable, and usable decentralized standard for social media that paves the path to solving the challenges listed above. Our commitment is to fund this work to that point and beyond."""

The comments from the leading social network come weeks after officials from the US, Britain and Australia called on Facebook to allow authorities to circumvent encryption to better fight extremism, child pornography and other crimes. ""The 'backdoor' access you are demanding for law enforcement would be a gift to criminals, hackers and repressive regimes, creating a way for them to enter our systems and leaving every person on our platforms more vulnerable to real-life harm,"" the heads of Facebook's WhatsApp and Messenger, Will Cathcart and Stan Chudnovsky, said in a letter to officials from the three countries. Critics have argued that new forms of encryption -- which can make it impossible for anyone except the sender and recipient to see the contents of a message -- are locking out law enforcement. Facebook, which already uses ""end-to-end"" encryption on WhatsApp, said in the letter it intends to do the same across all its messaging services. Jay Sullivan, the privacy product chief for Messenger, told a congressional hearing Tuesday Facebook was aware of its duty to work with law enforcement, pointing to the tech giant's assistance in terrorism and child abuse cases. Earlier Tuesday, more than 100 activist organisations, security experts and industry groups warned against efforts to force tech companies to weaken encryption. ""These exceptional access mechanisms for law enforcement agencies would be the same 'back doors' that provide an opportunity for terrorists, criminals, and other parties to gain unauthorised access,"" said the letter endorsed by groups including the American Civil Liberties Union, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. ""Technologists cannot build systems that are inherently able to tell when 'bad' people use them, just as engineers cannot design sidewalks and highways to crumble underneath the feet of certain people."" It said special access demands would ""embolden repressive and authoritarian regimes in their attempts to pressure messaging apps and device manufacturers to build surveillance capabilities into their products and services.""  

 A joint letter in October signed by US Attorney General William Barr, British Home Secretary Priti Patel and Australian Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton urged Facebook to give authorities the ability to circumvent encryption used in its messaging services. The officials said strong encryption made it more difficult for law enforcement to detect terrorism and child pornography, and that a move to implement ""end-to-end"" encryption on its Messenger platform could make matters worse. ""Facebook has not committed to address our serious concerns about the impact its proposals could have on protecting our most vulnerable citizens,"" said the October letter. At a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing Tuesday, New York District Attorney Cyrus Vance echoed those concerns, and argued that investigations were being crippled by the failure to get access to encrypted messages and smartphones, which cannot be accessed even with a warrant. ""Unintended or not, the reality remains that these tech titans are doing tremendous damage to our justice system, particularly justice at the local and state levels, by choosing to render themselves incapable of complying with a judge’s signed order,"" Vance said."

Thanks to the addictive and controversial Chinese-made platform, the gangly 20-year-old can now barely walk down the street without teenagers flocking to him for autographs. ""I get extremely excited watching people react to my videos on TikTok,"" Ansari told AFP in Mumbai, saying he tries to produce clips that make people happy, ""be it with a peppy song or comedy videos"". ""In a land of 1.3 billion people, grabbing popularity is not easy."" Launched by Chinese company ByteDance in September 2017, TikTok's playfulness and off-the-cuff humour -- users post short clips of themselves performing skits, lip-syncing and dancing -- has turned out to be its trump card. Last week the app hit 1.5 billion downloads worldwide, outperforming Instagram, which is better known for polished selfies than goofy memes. Anyone armed with a smartphone -- whether a suburban US teen or an Indian slum-dweller -- can use TikTok to tell their own story in under 60 seconds, experts say, winning viewers, likes, shares and eventually, the elusive goal of stardom. ""TikTok videos work because they are raw, making them more relatable for youngsters, who love receiving feedback and sometimes earn money from the app, depending on their popularity,"" Meenakshi Tiwari, an analyst at the US firm Forrester Research, told AFP. A sophisticated AI system enables the app to detect its users' tastes and point them to videos that keep them hooked for hours on end. - Pornography and politics - ""India is the main market for TikTok followed by China, the United States, Indonesia, and Vietnam,"" Craig Chapple from San Francisco-based research agency Sensor Tower told AFP. The South Asian nation accounts for 40 percent of TikTok's 800 million users worldwide and 11 of the top 25 stars on the app are based in India. That includes Ansari, who earns commissions for partnering with brands to promote their products, earning anywhere between 20,000 rupees ($280) to 50,000 rupees in a month. In China, where the app is called Douyin, viewers can purchase everything from face cream to clothing by tapping on videos created by influencers. But it hasn't been all fun and games -- the app has come under fire around the world over claims that it was encouraging the spread of child pornography. Bangladesh has banned it as part of a clampdown on porn, while Indonesia briefly blocked access over blasphemy concerns. TikTok has also been hit with an enormous fine in the United States for illegally collecting information from children. The app is wildly popular among teenagers and two-thirds of all TikTok users are aged under 30, according to Sensor Tower. In India, the app has often run into controversy, hitting the headlines in April after a teenager was accidentally shot dead by his friend in Delhi as they filmed a video featuring a pistol. Days later, an Indian court momentarily cut access to TikTok over paedophilia concerns. - Privacy fears - In addition to fears that the app could be used to promote pornographic content, political sensitivities have also surfaced as a flashpoint. Its Chinese origins have sparked concerns about the app serving as a soft power arm of Beijing, with TikTok facing a national security investigation in the United States to probe whether it is sending data to China. In July, the app suspended the accounts of some of its biggest Indian stars after the four men -- all Muslims -- posted videos criticising the lynching of a Muslim youth by a Hindu mob. The restrictions were later lifted but many believed the app's creators had succumbed to pressure from Hindu nationalists after a right-wing lawmaker from a regional party filed a case against the four TikTok influencers. Despite the scandals, the appetite for TikTok shows no sign of easing. ""From morning to late in the night, I only watch TikTok videos,"" 22-year-old Azeez Ahmed Siddiqui told AFP. ""My family thrashes me for not having a job and wasting my time on TikTok. But I really want to become a star,"" he said. With 3,500 followers, the road to TikTok superstardom seems a difficult one but the Mumbai-based Siddique is unfazed. ""I know a lot of people who had no careers and now are famous because of TikTok. ""If they can achieve this, then why can't I?"""

VK (VKontakte) is a Russian social media and networking service. It is available in numerous languages but is mainly used by Russian-speakers. With more than 500 million accounts, it is the 12th most visited website in the world. Ticac investigators found the group had been created in Russia and later purchased by Thai investors, with Mr Korakot serving as an administrator. Reviews of more than 100 porn clips were posted on the group. Those who wanted to watch uncensored clips had to pay membership fees of 300 baht each. Police posing as customers transferred membership fees to the administrator and later tracked the suspect to the condominium in Chiang Mai. The suspect initially confessed to the charges, saying he had been running the site for about one year, officers said.

											Pope Francis calls for action to safeguard women, children										",https://search.bangkokpost.com/track/visitAndRedirect?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bangkokpost.com%2Fthailand%2Fgeneral%2F1799069%2Fpope-francis-calls-for-action-to-safeguard-women-children&contentId=news1799069,"Pope Francis called for migrants to be made welcome and women and children to be protected from exploitation, abuse and enslavement as he began a busy two days of activities in Thailand on Thursday. Francis pleaded for action against one of the region's greatest scourges, human trafficking to fuel the forced labour and sex trade industries, as he began a weeklong visit to Asia. He praised the Thai government's efforts to fight human trafficking in a speech delivered at host Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha's Government House offices. But he appealed for greater international commitment to protect women and children ""who are violated and exposed to every form of exploitation, enslavement, violence and abuse''. He called for ways to ""uproot this evil and to provide ways to restore their dignity''. ""The future of our peoples is linked in large measure to the way we will ensure a dignified future to our children,'' he said. The United Nations considers Thailand a key trafficking destination as well as a source of forced labour and sex slaves, who are trafficked at home or abroad. The UN anti-trafficking agency says migrants come from Laos, Myanmar, Cambodia or Vietnam, with Cambodian women and children in particular trafficked to beg in Thai cities. The US State Department has faulted Thailand for failing to fully crack down on traffickers who induce young Thai girls into pornography, as well as the exploitation, including via debt bondage, of migrant workers in commercial fishing enterprises. The Thai government has insisted it has made significant progress in cracking down on human trafficking and has vowed continued cooperation with international bodies to improve. Francis has made the fight against human trafficking one of the cornerstones of his papacy, calling it a crime against humanity. Under his express wishes, the Vatican has hosted several conferences on eradicating trafficking, featuring women freed from forced prostitution. And during his papacy, an international network of religious sisters, Talitha Kum, has gained greater prominence following decades of quiet efforts to rescue women from traffickers. While Thailand has a tradition of taking in migrant labourers and sheltering people fleeing from danger in neighbouring countries, it also has a checkered history of deporting foreigners who are in the country illegally, even if they are recognised by the United Nations as refugees who are fleeing persecution. In addition, up until it signed an agreement with the UN refugee agency this year, Thailand held child asylum-seekers in detention centres. In his comments made alongside Thai officials, Francis thanked the country for its historical role welcoming migrants from across the region, who are drawn to Thailand for economic opportunities. But he said all countries must do more to resolve the conflicts that fuel the ""tragic exodus'' of forced migration. ""May every nation devise effective means for protecting the dignity and rights of migrants and refugees, who face dangers, uncertainties and exploitation in their quest for freedom and a decent life for their families,'' he said. Francis had a busy schedule on his first full day of activities of his weeklong tour, which will also take him to Japan. During a meeting with Thailand's Supreme Patriarch of Buddhism, Francis committed the Catholic Church to working more with Thailand's majority Buddhists to launch projects to care for the poor and the environment. Francis's visit was the second time a pope has called on the spiritual leader of Thailand's Buddhists, after St John Paul II in 1984. There are fewer than 400,000 Catholics among Thailand's 65 million people, yet Francis said they nevertheless have enjoyed freedom in their religious practice. He called for increasing charitable initiatives to improve fraternity and to help the poor ""and our much-abused common home.'' His visit to Wat Ratchabophit was followed by a visit to a Catholic hospital. He was to wrap up the day with a private audience with His Majesty the King and a public Mass at Bangkok's National Stadium. Friday's agenda is far more church-based, with meetings with local clergy, Asian bishops and, separately,  a meeting with leaders of different Christian denominations and other faiths."

At the heart of their legal woes is their past work for Radio Free Asia, a US-funded broadcaster that has long been a trusted source of independent news in the country. Yeang Sothearin and Uon Chhin spent nine months in pre-trial detention in Phnom Penh's squalid Prey Sar Prison after their Nov 14, 2017, arrest. They were then released on bail but their torment continues. They await the outcome of an unpredictable trial that could yet see them sentenced to 15 years. The verdict has already been postponed twice. Although the trial was said to have concluded in August, the presiding judge declared on Oct 3 the evidence was insufficient to rule the men guilty or innocent. But rather than acquit them, he ordered a ""re-investigation"", meaning Yeang Sothearin and Uon Chhin's ordeal at the hands of Cambodia's politicised court system continues to this day with no end in sight. International focus on Cambodia has been on Prime Minister Hun Sen's clash with the main political opposition party which was outlawed in 2017, making Cambodia a de facto one-party state. With opposition leaders and activists treated as national traitors and criminals, the democracy that was meant to rise from the ashes of civil war after the 1991 Paris Peace Agreements lies in ruins. The government's treatment of a free press has been just as egregious. In Cambodia, state prosecutors equate independent journalism with espionage. They charged both men with providing ""information that is destructive to national defence to a foreign state"", on the pretext that they continued to work in secret for Radio Free Asia after it was forced to shutter its Phnom Penh bureau in September 2017, two months before their arrest. In fact, their contract with RFA had expired that September. With no job and in need of income, Uon Chhin had opened a karaoke production studio, which the government claimed was a clandestine news bureau. For good measure, prosecutors later added a pornography charge against both men. The arbitrary nature of the legal process against them reflects deeper problems. Cambodia has dashed international hopes that it would reckon with its haunting past under the murderous Khmer Rouge rule of the late 1970s and embrace democracy with strong, credible civil society institutions. Instead, its judiciary is widely viewed as a tool of the government to crush dissent. Social activists and reporters, as well as opposition party members, have repeatedly fallen foul of a prejudicial legal system. In January, opposition activist Kong Mas was arrested for writing on Facebook that the European Union planned to impose tariffs on Cambodian rice, which proved correct. Kong Mas was later sentenced to 18 months on separate charges related to his political activism. Labour activist Rath Roth Mony was deported from Thailand and sentenced in June to two years for helping Russian state-owned TV network RT make a documentary about child prostitution in Cambodia. Then in July, Cambodian military police arrested journalists Hun Sokha and Keo Ratana for reporting protests against forced evictions in the southern city of Sihanoukville. They too, face serious charges under the country's criminal code. The prosecution of Uon Chhin, a cameraman, and Yeang Sothearin, an editor and anchor, has proceeded despite a dearth of evidence. It undermines the high-minded declaration of the Cambodian government in December that it ""cherishes"" a free press and that RFA would be welcome to re-open its in-country bureau. It has left both men and their family members in limbo. Yeang Sothearin's two young children cling to him fearing that he could be torn away from them at any moment. His and Uon Chhin's passports have been confiscated. For Yeang Sothearin, this means he cannot visit his ailing father, an indigenous Khmer living in southern Vietnam. Thirty-seven groups, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, last month jointly condemned the continued investigation. The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention has already concluded that Uon Chhin and Yeang Sothearin should be unconditionally released and given compensation. So, almost two years on, it's long overdue for Cambodia's government to end the pointless persecution of two proud journalists, which has become emblematic of the country's descent into authoritarianism. If they are cleared of all charges, Hun Sen could rekindle some fading hope for democracy and the freedom of expression. Libby Liu is President of Radio Free Asia."

Mr Thanawut allegedly ran a Twitter account under the alias ""Khun Gorn"". The account is alleged to have  been registered to attract followers and sell membership to a secret website he also set up for airing sex shows.  According to the TICAC, he lured young girls, many believed to be underage, and had sex with them while broadcasting it live on the members-only website.  His Twitter page has racked up more than 50,000 followers. Many of them also paid a one-off fee of 300 baht to be members, who were given access to the website to view the live sex shows.  Mr Thanawut allegedly confessed to the crime. He faces charges of possessing and selling online sexual content involving minors.  The offences carry a jail term of 3-10 years and/or fine of 60,000-200,000 baht. Police searched his apartment and found large quantities of online pornographic material, the TICAC announcement said. Investigators were trying to find out if the girls featured in the live shows were victims of a human trafficking gang.  On Oct 22, police arrested another man, identified as Theerawut Somklaew, 27, who operated a similar pornographic website for members in Udon Thani. It was unclear if Mr Theerawut was linked to Mr Thanawut. Mr Theerawut's bank accounts were ordered frozen to facilitate a check on his money trail.

Social networking giant Facebook is keen to get in on the act by launching a digital currency called Libra. But US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has aired his ongoing opposition to the move, saying many concerns remained unresolved, including ""the issue of money laundering"".  Despite tighter regulations and increased vigilance by the authorities, illegal activities related to virtual currencies remained ""significant"", Madeleine Kennedy, from the research firm Chainalysis, told AFP.  - 1% of transactions illegal - A Chainalysis report published in January said that in 2018, one percent of Bitcoin transactions -- the most widely used cryptocurrency -- involved illegal activities.   The equivalent of $600 million was also spent using Bitcoins on the dark web, a set of hidden networks where a multitude of illicit products, including weapons and drugs, are traded.  In comparison, the global turnover of drug trafficking is estimated at several hundred billion dollars.  Kennedy believes the use of Bitcoins for criminal purposes was partly based on a ""misunderstanding"".  The confidentiality reputation of the most famous cryptocurrency is unrivalled, with all transactions recorded in an unforgeable public ledger, the blockchain.  But it is ""more transparent than some traditional financial systems and certainly more than cash"", she added. The British and US authorities last week announced more than 300 arrests in 38 countries as part of an investigation that led to the dismantling of an unprecedented child pornography ring.  Investigators analysed the blockchain and succeeded in ""de-anonymising Bitcoin transactions,"" according to Ron Fort, the head of criminal investigations in the US tax services.  - Concerns about Monero -  But if Bitcoin is still the reference currency for criminals because of its popularity, they are turning to less transparent alternatives, such as Monero, which began life in in 2014, according to the European law enforcement agency Europol.  Monero's users can remain anonymous until they need to interact with a cryptomarketing platform or invest their funds with a ""wallet"" -- the equivalent of an account for virtual currencies.  It is phenomenon that also worries the German finance ministry, which recently published a document warning that anonymous cryptos could become ""a real alternative to Bitcoin"".  Monero, whose capitalisation is still 160 times lower than Bitcoin, uses a complex architecture that makes transactions ""much more difficult to track"", said Kennedy.  ""But no more than the many shell companies in the many tax havens,"" said Emilien Bernard-Alzias, a lawyer at Simmons & Simmons, a specialist in financial markets.  ""We have always seen both legal and technical arrangements to conceal money transfers from the courts,"" he told AFP, adding that only cash can be considered ""perfectly untraceable"".  Also, since Monero does not allow large quantities of money to be bought, criminals are encouraged to convert their funds and must therefore use service providers subject to anti-money laundering regulations.  Unlike currencies that have made anonymity a marketing feature, Facebook has repeatedly said in recent months that Libra will be transparent and comply with the authorities' requirements.  Libra ""will clearly not be ideal for laundering dirty money"", said Bernard-Alzias, although it will probably need to use blockchain analysts ""to satisfy regulators"", added Kennedy. "

											Dissident Bukovsky, who exposed Soviet punitive psychiatry, dies										",https://search.bangkokpost.com/track/visitAndRedirect?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bangkokpost.com%2Fworld%2F1781669%2Fdissident-bukovsky-who-exposed-soviet-punitive-psychiatry-dies&contentId=news1781669,"MOSCOW - Vladimir Bukovsky, a prominent dissident and writer who helped expose the Soviet Union's abuse of psychiatry to silence critics, has died in Britain aged 76. Bukovsky, whose health had been poor in recent years, died after suffering a cardiac arrest in hospital in Cambridge, England on Sunday night, said the Bukovsky Center, a US-based volunteer organisation linked to the dissident. By the age of 35, Bukovsky had spent 12 years in Soviet prisons, labour camps and psychiatric hospitals as a dissident who openly opposed the regime.  He was one of the first to expose the practice of punitive psychiatry in the USSR. Soviet medics issued political dissidents with false diagnoses of mental illness and incarcerated them in psychiatric hospitals where they were forced to take strong-acting medicines.  The practice became especially widespread between the mid-1960s and the breakup of the Soviet Union. ""The Soviet authorities used to call Bukovsky a hooligan involved in anti-Soviet activities,"" top rights group Memorial said on Twitter.  ""We call him a hero and say thank you."" Bukovsky first gained prominence as a student activist.  In 1963, he was arrested for possessing forbidden literature. Authorities declared him mentally ill and put him in a psychiatric hospital. He was arrested again in 1967 and sent to a labour camp for three years.  In 1971, he managed to have psychiatric hospital records for six dissidents smuggled to the West, creating an uproar. After another prison sentence, in 1976, he was deported from the USSR and exchanged in Zurich for Luis Corvalan, the head of the Chilean Communist party in a prisoner swap agreed with dictator Augusto Pinochet. He settled in Britain. - 'Licence to kill' -  After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Bukovsky came to Moscow and smuggled out top secret documents from the Communist Party's Central Committee archives. Bukovsky was a critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, claiming that the USSR and Russia were not much different.  In a 2006 article in The Times dubbed ""Licence to kill"", Bukovsky warned that Putin had pushed through legislation that would allow Moscow to assassinate its enemies in any country. Later that year, Bukovsky's friend and Kremlin critic Alexander Litvinenko died in London following radioactive poisoning. In 2008, Bukovsky tried to run for president in Russia but was not allowed to stand as a candidate. In his later years, he was caught up in a child pornography case. He was arrested by British police in 2014 and charged with making and possessing indecent images of children. He denied the charges.  The trial was suspended due to his ill health. Bukovsky penned a number of books including his bestselling 1978 autobiography, ""To Build a Castle: My Life As a Dissenter"", in which he detailed his life in the Gulag and psychiatric hospitals. On Monday, opposition leader Dmitry Gudkov recommended that Russians read Bukovsky's memoirs. ""Not a single word has become obsolete there,"" Gudkov said on Twitter."

Authorities from the United States, Britain, South Korea and other countries said they had rescued at least 23 minor victims of sexual exploitation who were often video-recorded by abusers who then sold the videos on the now-shuttered ""Welcome to Video"" site on the darknet. The website sold the videos to users for bitcoin, which makes it extremely difficult to track the buyer. From June 2015, when ""Welcome to Video"" started up, to March 2018, the website received at least 420 bitcoin virtual currency -- around $370,000 at the time of the payments -- in at least 7,300 transactions, the US Justice Department said in an indictment. The server, which had about 250,000 videos, was seized by US, British and South Korean police on March 5, 2018 and the operator, 23-year-old Son Jong Woo was arrested and jailed in Korea. Since then hundreds of users from 12 countries have been tracked down and arrested. On Wednesday, US authorities unsealed a US indictment of Son as well as announcing the seizure of virtual currency accounts of 24 people in five countries that had been ""used to fund the website and promote the exploitation of children."" - British arrest sparked probe - The collaboration between global law enforcement agencies was sparked by the British investigation into a British scientist for child sex offenses, according to Britain's National Crime Agency. Matthew Falder was sentenced to 25 years in jail in 2017 after admitting 137 counts of online abuse, including the encouragement of child rape and even the abuse of a baby. ""The website monetized the sexual abuse of children and was one of the first to offer sickening videos for sale using the cryptocurrency bitcoin,"" the NCA said in a statement. The NCA said seven men have already been convicted in Britain since the first suspect was arrested in 2017. One man ""was jailed for 22 years for raping a five-year-old boy and appearing on Welcome To Video sexually abusing a three-year-old girl."" - Bitcoin accounts tracked - In Washington, the US Department of Justice said the site operated ""the largest child sexual exploitation market by volume of content"" when it was taken down. US authorities have investigated 92 individuals in the case. Many of those arrested have been charged and sentenced. ""This was one of the first times that law enforcement saw the use of cryptocurrency in trafficking child pornography,"" said  US Attorney Jessie Liu. ""The site hosted more than a quarter million videos and users downloaded more than one million files,"" she said. Don Fort of the US Internal Revenue Service, which took part in the investigation, said it demonstrated that criminals can be tracked on the darknet and cannot conceal their identities behind cryptocurrency accounts. ""You went on the dark web, thinking that your actions were anonymous, but they weren't, and we found you,"" he told a press conference in Washington.

Kelly pleaded not guilty on Friday in a New York court to federal charges including racketeering that allege he systematically recruited girls for sex while touring. The disgraced superstar -- who for decades has faced sexual abuse accusations -- was brought to the Brooklyn courthouse from Chicago, where he was being held without bond on separate federal charges linked to child pornography. ""Yes sir,"" was all Kelly, dressed in blue prison scrubs, said during the arraignment, when asked by the judge whether he understood the charges against him. His two girlfriends and some family members were in court, along with around a dozen fans. One wore a t-shirt that had ""Free R Kelly"" written on the front and ""Unmute R Kelly"" on the back. A couple had also made crowns with his image on it and the words ""Justice 4 R Kelly"" The New York indictment unsealed last month says Kelly, 52, would regularly issue wristbands to girls via his associates that granted them backstage access and face time with the musician known for hits like ""I Believe I Can Fly."" Kelly would tell members of his entourage to obtain contact information from girls he wished to see again, the charges read, some of whom were invited to later concerts and provided with lodging. Girls were to call Kelly ""Daddy"" and stay inside their rooms without permission from the singer to leave, even to eat or use the restroom, according to court documents. The New York case involves five unidentified women, three of whom were minors at the time of the alleged crimes, which include coercing sexual activity. He is also accused of kidnapping one of the victims, and exposing another to a venereal disease without her knowledge. Kelly, whose given name is Robert Kelly, additionally faces charges of violating the Mann Act, which prohibits transporting people across state lines for purposes of prostitution. - 'Extreme danger' - Following the arraignment in New York, Kelly is expected to be taken back to Chicago, where he is being held on suspicion of having sex with five underage girls, recording some of it, and then attempting to hide the evidence. Kelly must attend a status hearing in the Midwestern city on September 4, having pleaded not guilty to that 13-count indictment. Last month, he was denied bond after prosecutors described him as ""an extreme danger to the community, especially to minor girls,"" arguing that neither house arrest nor electronic monitoring would suffice. Prior to his arrest in July over the federal indictment, Kelly had been out on bond in connection with state felony charges of aggravated sexual assault in Chicago's Cook County criminal court. Kelly has a decades-long history of abuse allegations, especially of underage girls.  In 1994, he wed his protegee Aaliyah, the late R&B star who was 15 at the time. After a dramatic trial, Kelly was acquitted in 2008 of child pornography charges, also in Chicago. Despite the slew of disturbing claims against him, the award-winning musician continued to perform for years and maintained a solid fan base. But he began facing renewed scrutiny earlier this year upon the release of the docu-series ""Surviving R. Kelly,"" which nabbed an Emmy nomination for outstanding informational series or special."

Ressa, who leads online outlet Rappler and was named a Time Magazine ""Person of the Year"" in 2018 for her journalism, is out on bail and faces years in prison if convicted under the criminal cyber-libel law. The news portal has written extensively and often critically on Duterte's policies, including his deadly drugs war that rights groups say may be a crime against humanity. Besides the libel case, Ressa and Rappler have been hit with 10 other criminal charges over the past year, prompting allegations that authorities are targeting her and her team for their work. ""The government hopes to intimidate us by syphoning both my personal time, our resources,"" Ressa, who was not in court, told AFP. ""I won't be intimidated. We continue to do our jobs. The mission of journalism has never been as important as it is today in the Philippines,"" she added. (continues below) Archive video:  

 Tuesday's brief hearing ended after testimony from one minor witness, with the case set to resume on July 30. The case centres on a Rappler report from 2012 about a businessman's alleged ties to a then-judge of the nation's top court. Government investigators initially dismissed the businessman's 2017 complaint about the article, but state prosecutors later decided to file charges. The legal foundation of the case is a controversial ""cybercrime law"" aimed at online offences ranging from hacking and internet fraud to child pornography. Ressa, 55, argues the law did not take effect until months after the story was published. Government lawyers say it is effectively a new article since Rappler had updated it in 2014 to fix a typographical error. Because the law allows the filing of charges up to 12 years after libel is committed, Ressa said it will have far-ranging implications on constitutionally protected freedom of expression as well as the way Filipinos use social media. Ressa, who has been arrested twice this year, also faces tax and corporate fraud cases, as does Rappler. The libel case has drawn international attention, with Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland and former US secretary of state Madeleine Albright expressing concern over democratic rights. Prominent rights lawyer Amal Clooney, who joined Ressa's legal team this month, said the case echoed a recurring theme in her work, where ""journalists who expose abuses face arrest while those who commit the abuses do so with impunity"".

Kelly to be held without bond on sweeping federal charges linked to child pornography and other crimes at a hearing Tuesday. The musician who for decades has faced sexual abuse accusations was arrested last week on suspicion of having sex with five underage girls, recording some of it, and then attempting to hide the evidence. According to local media federal prosecutors described the musician -- known for hits like ""I Believe I Can Fly"" -- as ""an extreme danger to the community, especially to minor girls"" in arguing that neither house arrest nor electronic monitoring would suffice. ""This risk of obstruction is real. This risk is ongoing. This risk is heightened by the defendant's fame and power,"" one prosecutor told Judge Harry Leinenweber, according to the Chicago Sun-Times. After being denied bond the artist born Robert Kelly pleaded not guilty to the 13-count indictment. In a separate blow Kelly, 52, also faces a five-count superseding indictment in New York on charges including racketeering, as well as coercing and transporting minors to have sex. He has not yet been arraigned in the New York case, and federal prosecutors have indicated he would eventually be brought there to face charges.  Following the Chicago hearing Kelly's lawyer Steve Greenberg said the artist is ""obviously disappointed"" to remain in custody, with the attorney dubbing his jailing ""largely inhumane."" ""He's absolutely not a flight risk,"" Greenberg told journalists. ""He's in 24-hour-a-day solitary confinement... because that's the safest place for them to house him."" Prior to his arrest last week Kelly had been out on bond in connection with state felony charges of aggravated sexual assault in Chicago's Cook County criminal court. Kelly has a decades-long history of abuse allegations, especially of underage girls. In 1994 he wed his protegee Aaliyah, the late R&B star who was 15 at the time. He began facing renewed scrutiny earlier this year upon the release of the docu-series ""Surviving R. Kelly,"" which on Tuesday nabbed an Emmy nomination for outstanding informational series or special."

He initially faces charges of possessing and trading child pornography, as two of the victims were under 18. Police say the suspect, who works as a graphic designer for television shows on a popular station, created a Facebook account using an image of a woman as his profile photo. Claiming to be the page of a modelling agent, it targeted young women who wanted to work as product presenters, or “pretties” as they are commonly known, said a police source. When young women responded and began chatting with the suspect via Facebook, he persuaded them to send nude images and clips by telling them they would be shown to customers for job purposes. He also told his victims that he could help them get into the entertainment industry, said the source. After receiving the pictures, the suspect pretended to ask for the numbers of the senders’ bank accounts so that he could transfer money to them. But after they sent him the account numbers, he blocked them on his Facebook account. He then asked some victims to send him more nude photos or he would share their other images online if they refused, said the source. Some victims later found their photos and clips on a pornography website. They then filed a complaint with the Ticac unit at the Royal Thai Police Office. Ticac subsequently opened the investigation that shed light on the suspect’s activities. During the raid on the suspect’s house, three electronic devices were seized. A search at his office found more pornographic clips of victims on his office computer and mobile phones.

Naason Joaquin Garcia, who is known by members of the La Luz del Mundo (The Light of the World) as the ""Apostle,"" faces US charges for 26 suspected felonies, including rape of minor and child pornography, committed between 2015 and 2018. Prosecutors allege Garcia and three co-defendents - all women affiliated with the church - coerced minor girls into performing sexual acts by convincing them that if they went against the ""Apostle"" they were also going against God.  ""These are all false accusations,"" Adrian Calvillo, a spokesperson for the Guadalajara-based church, said at a press conference. ""This is something we consider to be totally slanderous.""  Nicolas Menchaca, a public relations representative from the church, complained that the $25 million bail set by a California judge ""seems extremely disproportionate."" If it can be shown that bail for others has been set lower then ""we consider this an act of religious discrimination,"" he said.   California's Attorney General Xavier Becerra said authorities had launched an investigation into Garcia in 2018 following an online complaint about clergy abuse to the California Department of Justice.

With widespread poverty, lax laws, and creaking judicial systems, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, and the Philippines have long been seen as soft spots by foreign and local paedophiles seeking out underage sex in person. Tougher policing and greater awareness has deterred some offenders, but technology has shifted the patterns of abuse in a region with growing access to broadband internet and encrypted technology. Paedophiles can now use an array of mobile and online tools — including social networks, video-sharing sites, and the dark web — to direct and watch child rape and sexual abuse with anonymity, experts warn. ""Predators watch the rapes on large platforms that are not likely to close,"" said François Xavier Souchet, of Thai-based NGO Terre des Hommes. ""It's live, nothing is recorded... everything is encrypted. They pay more and more in bitcoins — encrypted money makes their transactions as secure as possible,"" he added. This week online giants including Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Facebook are giving evidence to the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse (IICSA), which is being held in London and will look at how to prevent online sex crimes as part of its remit. 'I want to die' Demand for child sexual abuse via webcam is an increasing cause of human trafficking, according to a UN report, with suggestions Thailand has become a hub in the trade, as well as the Philippines. Cassie, a Filipina victim, said she was just 12 when she was forced to commit sexual acts — both with an adult man and alone — in front of a webcam. She moved to Manila to work as a maid but was exploited by her mother's employer. The torment went on for five years. She said: ""I felt trapped, betrayed and alone. I was thinking, 'I want to die, I want to die because of this pain, but I can't'."" Her abuser received a two-year jail term in 2017. Last month, advocacy and legal aid group International Justice Mission (IJM) warned Philippine children were at risk of being forced into live streamed sex abuse, where paedophiles pay to direct so-called ""shows"" online. ""Easy access to the web and money transfer services make the country a global hotspot for this problem,"" said IJM, noting that it is often parents or family members that organise or even commit the abuse. Terre des Hommes drew attention to the problem using a computer-generated girl nicknamed ""Sweetie"" that hung out in chatrooms and was approached by about 20,000 people — mostly men — in a matter of weeks. Last year a report by the Internet Watch Foundation found online child abuse imagery had increased by a third in 2017. Death penalty In March, a teacher was arrested and charged in his native France with rape, abuse of minors and possession of child pornography. The 51-year-old, who worked in schools in Asia, is alleged to have befriended kids in a working-class Bangkok neighbourhood before building a rapport on social networks, police sources told AFP. The same month, prosecutors charged another Frenchman with ordering videos of rape and sexual assaults of Filipino children. The suspect, a 55-year-old former police officer, was arrested after a seizure of computers and live-streaming equipment in the Philippines. In late April, former British Army officer Andrew Whiddett, 70, was found guilty by a London court of spending thousands of pounds paying for live-streamed sexual abuse of children from the Philippines. The National Crime Agency (NCA) estimates 80,000 people in the UK present some kind of sexual threat to children online. The cyber-abuse phenomenon is reaching ""Cambodia and Vietnam"", warned Damian Kean, of the Thai-based NGO ECPAT, which specialises in combating the sexual exploitation of children. In hyperconnected Vietnam, foreign paedophiles are increasingly targeting young victims online, often on social media. The communist state last year instated harsher penalties to combat the crime — anyone guilty of molesting a child under 16 faces 12 years in prison, while child rape comes with a maximum sentence of death. But catching a paedophile requires help from the communities within which they operate - communities which are often marginalised, poor and mistrustful. Souchet of Terre des Hommes explained: ""Particularly ethnic minority communities across the region do not trust local authorities."""

											Pope changes Church law to make reporting sex abuse obligatory										",https://search.bangkokpost.com/track/visitAndRedirect?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bangkokpost.com%2Fworld%2F1674736%2Fpope-changes-church-law-to-make-reporting-sex-abuse-obligatory&contentId=news1674736,"VATICAN CITY - Pope Francis on Thursday passed a landmark new measure to oblige those who know about sex abuse in the Catholic Church to report it to their superiors, in a move which could bring countless new cases to light. Every diocese in the world will now be obliged to have a system for the reporting of abuse, under a new law published by the Vatican following a global clerical paedophilia scandal. But the requirement will not apply to secrets revealed to priests in the confessional. It is time to learn from the ""bitter lessons of the past"", Francis said in the text of the legal decree, which comes into effect on June 1. It follows a series of clerical assault cases in countries ranging from Australia to Chile, Germany and the US. The ""Motu Proprio"", a legal document issued under the pope's personal authority, declares that anyone who has knowledge of abuse, or suspects it, is ""obliged to report (it) promptly"" to the Church, using ""easily accessible systems"". Under the new measure, every diocese around the world is obliged by June 2020 to create a system for the reporting of sexual abuse by clerics, the use of child pornography and cover-ups of abuse. The law could see the Vatican inundated with reports of abuse or cover-ups, as it applies retroactively, meaning those who know about old cases are obliged to flag them up as well. - 'Bring predators to justice' - The impact ""likely will be felt most intensely outside the West, since places such as the US, Canada and some parts of Western Europe (though, ironically, not the pope's backyard in Italy), already have fairly robust reporting systems,"" said Vatican expert John Allen, on the online religious newspaper Crux Now. The law only applies within the Church and has no force to oblige individuals to report abuse to civil authorities. ""The Motu Proprio shows Pope Francis expects swift and comprehensive progress,"" commented Cardinal Daniel DiNardo, head of the Bishops' Conference in the United States, where thousands have people have reported abuse. It will ""empower the Church everywhere to bring predators to justice, no matter what rank they hold,"" he said. The document focuses particularly on the sexual or psychological abuse of children and vulnerable adults, but also targets sexual abuse and violence resulting from an abuse of authority -- such as the exploitation of nuns by priests. Pope Francis admitting publicly in February that priests have used nuns as ""sexual slaves"" -- and may still be doing so. - 'Exhaustive in scope' - ""The new norms... are exhaustive in scope, applying in some way to every ordained or vowed member of the 1.3 billion-person church,"" Vatican watcher Joshua McElwee wrote in the National Catholic Reporter. That raises the question as to how realistic it is for the Vatican to promise a response to reports within 30 days, particularly considering there are scores of cases currently backlogged, Allen said. Victims' groups have long called for Francis to put in place concrete measures to tackle clerical child abuse, but they want more, including the immediate dismissal of any cleric found guilty of even a single act of abuse, or of covering it up. They also want all abusers or suspected abusers to be reported to police, and any abuse-related files handed over to them. Some have called for priests who hear of abuse during confessions to be forced to report it. The new law stops short of that. Catholics believe that within the confessional the penitent is talking to God, and everything in the confession is secret. A priest who reveals such secrets is automatically expelled from the Church."

As the deputy commander of the Technology Crime Suppression Division (TCSD), Pol Col Siriwat is responsible for overseeing investigations into cybercrime cases. While he is known for his relentless battle against the trade of child pornography by online criminal gangs, recently he has been focusing on groups that specialise in creating and distributing fake information through social media, which is increasingly being used by certain groups and/or individuals to undermine their political rivals. Pol Col Siriwat was a student of Class 33 in the Armed Forces Academies Preparatory School, and a graduate of the Royal Police Cadet Academy. He then obtained a master's degree and a doctorate in criminology from Mahidol University. He was starting out as an officer at a police station in Nonthaburi, when he began to develop an interest in computer sciences and technology -- an interest that served him well and defined his career path. Later, he was put in charge of TCSD's 2nd sub-division, and subsequently, the 3rd sub-division. His job was to deal with online transnational crimes, including sex trafficking and child pornography. He was promoted as the TCSD's deputy commander in the latest police reshuffle last month. ""As an officer at a police station, I only handled thefts and other petty crimes,"" he said. ""But I was keen to learn more about the world of online crimes, and I want to see how it [cybercrime] differs from conventional crimes."" Pol Col Siriwat said that by combining the practical experience he gained when he served in the field with the knowledge he attained from studying computer sciences, he managed to make headway in his battle against online criminals -- particularly those who trade in child pornography. For example, the TCSD arrested a Moldovan national in May last year for violating the Computer Crimes Act by operating a pornographic website that raked in about 123 million baht annually. The suspect, identified as Serghei Cependiuc, 30, was arrested at a house in Thap Sakae district in Prachuap Khiri Khan, where he lived with his Thai wife. He was found to have travelled in and out of Thailand since 2009. The website contained pornographic images of underaged people, and was accessed by members who paid monthly fees of US$19.95 (640 baht), according to the TCSD. The arrest happened after the Dutch police alerted Thai authorities that Mr Cependiuc is one of the website administrators. ""When it comes to fighting cybercrime, we have to constantly keep up with these criminals who have now moved on to the internet,"" he said. ""All they need to commit a crime is a mobile phone, a bank account, plus the courage to take a big risk."" As Thailand's social media usage continues to increase in intensity, criminals are following suit and often mark their victims on social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. ""Online fraud is increasingly becoming a problem, and criminals are constantly devising new and more sophisticated tactics to stay one step ahead of investigators,"" he said. As such, it is important to educate the public -- especially young students -- about the dangers of cybercrimes, Pol Col Siriwat said. Because cybercrimes can be carried out from anywhere in the country, the TCSD has organised sessions to hone the skills of police officers nationwide to handle high-tech criminal cases. Pol Col Siriwat also said he is currently focusing his attention on tackling the dissemination of fake news, which has been used to attack political rivals before and after the March 24 election. ""The TCSD has already set up a centre to monitor fake news around the clock,"" he said. He said that while Thailand has laws which can effectively deal with cybercrimes -- such as the Computer Crimes Act -- there is a shortage of police officers that has the necessary skills to handle such crimes. Currently, there are only 170 TCSD officers nationwide. However, provincial police have set up their own cybercrime units, where people can file complaints instead of travelling to the TCSD's headquarters in Bangkok."

The dramatic price cut for the iconic property is partly due to years of drought in the region that affected the real estate market, Kyle Forsyth, one of the listing agents, told US media. He said the compound has been well maintained and ""with the drought ending and the Santa Ynez Valley in full bloom,"" now was the best time to sell. Jackson reportedly paid $19.5 million for the property in the 1980s but a real estate investment firm bought it in 2008 for $22.5 million after the singer defaulted on a loan.  The King of Pop died the following year. News of the sale comes as HBO is set to air on Sunday a damning four-hour documentary titled ""Leaving Neverland,"" which includes the testimonies of two men who claim Jackson sexually abused them as children all over the ranch, including the attic, the master bedroom and the pool. Jackson faced multiple allegations of child sex abuse during his lifetime. His ranch was raided in 2003 as part of a child molestation case against him and police at the time seized a large collection of pornography and images of nude children. Jackson was acquitted in the case in 2005."

R&B singer R. Kelly is shown arriving at a Chicago police station on February 22, 2019, a day before a court set bail at $1 million on 10 charges of sexual abuse Kelly, who is known for hits like ""I Believe I Can Fly,"" surrendered to police late Friday. He is charged with 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse against the four females, one of them as young as 14 at the time of the alleged crimes. In setting bail, Judge John Fitzgerald Lyke Jr. ordered Kelly to not have contact with anyone under 18 years old, and to not have contact with any of the alleged victims or witnesses. The singer was required to relinquish his passport. Prosecutors described a video showing Kelly repeatedly having sex with the 14-year-old, DNA evidence from another victim's shirt that they said matched Kelly's and semen from a second victim that preliminary tests showed appeared to be his. Prosecutor Kimberly Foxx said a witness, not publicly identified, had provided the video showing Kelly repeatedly having oral and vaginal sex with the youngest girl. ""In the video,"" the prosecutor said, ""the victim repeatedly, repeatedly, says she is 14 years old."" Kelly met another alleged victim at her 16th birthday party, making clear he knew her age, Foxx said. She met with him several times after that, and was handed an envelope with ""a large amount of money,"" the prosecutor said. Illinois outlaws sex for those under 17 when the partner is at least five years older. Kelly is 52. He would have been 31 at the time of the earliest alleged abuse. In yet another case, Foxx said, Kelly had an appointment to have his hair braided by a 24-year-old hairdresser. While she was waiting alone in a room for him, Foxx said, Kelly entered, his pants down, and tried to force her head down to his groin. She resisted but Kelly then ""ejaculated onto the victim and spit in her face several times,"" Foxx said. DNA on her shirt, given to Illinois state police for testing, was found to match Kelly's DNA profile, the prosecution said. Although his bail was set at $1 million, Kelly needs to put up only a tenth that amount, or $100,000, to be let out of jail. His next court appearance is an arraignment scheduled for March 8, when he will have an opportunity to enter a plea. The swift turn of events came after a documentary series drew renewed attention to decades of accusations that the popular performer had engaged in child pornography, sex with minors and sexual battery. A grand jury in Chicago handed down the 10-count indictment Friday alleging aggravated sexual abuse involving the four victims. Foxx -- the state's attorney for Cook County, which includes Chicago -- told journalists the alleged crimes occurred between 1998 and 2010. The charges carry three to seven years of prison per count, she said. - High-profile lawyers - Kelly's lawyer Steve Greenberg said the charges were based on old and false accusations. ""I think all of the women are lying,"" he said. ""Everybody's trying to profit off of R. Kelly."" It is the second time Chicago prosecutors have charged Kelly with a sex crime. He was acquitted in 2008 of 21 counts of child pornography after a dramatic trial. Greenberg said one of the current charges involved a victim implicated in that trial. High-profile lawyer Michael Avenatti and prominent women's rights attorney Gloria Allred are representing clients linked to Kelly. Avenatti -- who also represents a porn star locked in a legal battle with President Donald Trump -- said his office had uncovered previously unreleased footage of Kelly having sex with a teenager, which he had given to the Cook County State's Attorney. Avenatti said the approximately 40-minute tape, shot in the late 1990s, ""leaves no question"" of Kelly's guilt, and that both the victim and the musician refer multiple times to her age as 14, with the girl referring repeatedly to Kelly as ""daddy."" - Explosive docu-series - Kelly infamously is known for marrying his protege Aaliyah in 1994, when the late R&B star was 15.

Pope Francis called the unprecedented Vatican summit in an effort to get on top of a crisis that has dogged the Roman Catholic Church for decades ""Files that could have documented the terrible deeds and named those responsible were destroyed, or not even created,"" German Cardinal Reinhard Marx told a landmark Vatican summit on tackling paedophilia in the clergy. ""Instead of the perpetrators, the victims were regulated and silence imposed on them. ""The stipulated procedures and processes for the prosecution of offences were deliberately not complied with, but instead cancelled or overridden,"" he said. Marx was speaking on the third day of an unprecedented meeting of the world's top bishops which Pope Francis has called in an effort to get on top of a crisis that has dogged the Roman Catholic Church for decades. The ongoing scandals have escalated to touch many countries across the globe, with recent cases affecting Chile, Germany and the US. The cardinal apologised personally in September to thousands of victims of sexual assault by clergy in the German Church, saying perpetrators must be brought to justice. That followed the publication of a damning report by the German Bishops' Conference showing that almost 3,700 minors -- mainly boys -- were assaulted in Germany between 1946 and 2014. The report's authors said the figure was ""the tip of the iceberg"". - 'Victims' rights trampled' - Investigations have revealed that in many cases priests accused of assaulting minors were transferred to other parishes as bishops turned a blind eye to protect the Church's reputation. ""The rights of victims were effectively trampled underfoot, and left to the whims of individuals. These are all events that sharply contradict what the Church should stand for,"" Marx said. The cardinal said it was essential that victims felt ""that they can trust the system"". ""There are no alternatives to traceability and transparency,"" he insisted, adding that attempts to cover-up scandals risked seriously undermining the Catholic Church's credibility. Francis has told his bishops he wants ""concrete measures"" drawn up against child sex abuse, though survivor groups in Rome for the summit have accused the Vatican of fine words but little action. Survivors have lambasted the centuries-old institution for not releasing the names and case files of priests convicted of abuse or possessing child pornography. The Vatican has in the past refused to hand over internal documents about child sexual abuse cases to civil authorities investigating paedophilia. On Friday, Archbishop Charles Scicluna, one of the Vatican's top prosecutors and an organiser of the summit, said the call for statistics to be released was ""legitimate"". - 'Courageous step' - Marx, who belongs to the Church's more liberal wing, said telling the public about what sort of investigations were underway and how many, would help counter ""mistrust"" in the Church which ""leads to conspiracy theories"". Transparency was also ""extremely important"" for other aspects of the Church, ""for example in the area of finances"", he said. ""Let us take a courageous step in this direction,"" he added. Scandals surrounding the Vatican's bank have prompted a clean-up in recent years, first under Pope Benedict XVI and then under Francis, with some 5,000 bank accounts being closed. But the decision to sack the bank's deputy director in 2017 without explanation fuelled conspiracy theories, amid claims he was being axed because his investigations into possible illegal activity had hit too close to home. The bank became notorious after the 1982 death of Roberto Calvi, known as ""God's banker"" because of his links to the Vatican, whose corpse was discovered hanging from Blackfriars Bridge in London. Prosecutors believe it was a mafia killing linked to money laundering via the bank."

Singer-songwriter Ryan Adams apologized for any harm caused -- but denied a New York Times report that he exploited his position as a career mentor as a means to obtain sex. An expose in The New York Times details a pattern of manipulative behavior from the 44-year-old Grammy-nominated artist, including testimony from performer Mandy Moore, his ex-wife. In one instance the paper -- which interviewed more than half a dozen women and reviewed a trove of the US rocker's digital communications -- describes Adams as sending graphic texts to a 14-year-old aspiring bass player and exposing himself on Skype. The paper said he continued the sexually provocative correspondence for months despite appearing to doubt that she was of age. The country-influenced rocker -- known for his strong personality -- also allegedly presented women with opportunities to build their profiles while pursuing sex with them, turning angry and sometimes verbally abusive when rejected. Adams, who found fame as a solo artist in the 2000s thanks to his debut album ""Heartbreaker,"" apologized but denied the accusations shortly after the story's publication, saying ""to anyone I have ever hurt, however unintentionally, I apologize deeply and unreservedly."" ""But the picture that this article paints is upsettingly inaccurate,"" he tweeted. ""Some of its details are misrepresented; some are exaggerated; some are outright false. I would never have inappropriate interactions with someone I thought was underage. Period."" Adams' ex-wife Moore -- who rose to celebrity as a pop star and now acts in the series ""This Is Us"" -- said Adams belittled her career while engaging in a ""destructive, manic sort of back and forth behavior."" ""Music was a point of control for him,"" she said. The music industry has been less impacted by the #MeToo movement and crusades against workplace harassment than industries including Hollywood and media.

Philippine journalist Maria Ressa and her website have been hit with tax evasion charges and now a libel case after clashing repeatedly with Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte over his deadly crackdown on narcotics that has killed thousands. Ressa spent the night in detention after authorities arrested the veteran reporter at her Manila office Wednesday, a sharp upping of government pressure on her and her website Rappler. The site and Ressa have been hit with tax evasion charges and now a libel case after clashing repeatedly with Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte over his deadly crackdown on narcotics that has killed thousands. ""The message is clear. It's an abuse of power. It's a weaponisation of the law,"" Ressa told journalists as she prepared to head to court. ""If they want to scare me, this is not going to scare me,"" added Ressa, who was named a Time Magazine ""Person of the Year"" in 2018 for her journalism. Her lawyers said they expected to be able secure her release within the day as the charge should carry an automatic granting of bail. International condemnation from press freedom and human rights groups has poured in since plain clothes agents appeared at Rappler to serve an arrest warrant on the charge that carries up to 12 years behind bars. ""The arrest of Maria Ressa is an outrage,"" said Committee to Protect Journalists Board Chair Kathleen Carroll. ""She should be freed immediately and the Philippines government needs to cease its multi-pronged attack on Rappler."" Human Rights Watch Philippines researcher Carlos Conde agreed: ""The cases against Ressa and Rappler appear designed not only to intimidate the website, but to eventually shut it down."" ""Ressa's persecution is part of a broader campaign by the Duterte administration to harass and silence critics,"" he added. Duterte attacks on media The libel case against Ressa and former Rappler reporter Reynaldo Santos, Jr. stems from a 2012 report written about a businessman's alleged ties to a then-judge on the nation's top court. While investigators initially dismissed the businessman's 2017 complaint about the article, the case was subsequently forwarded to prosecutors for their consideration. The legal foundation of the case is a controversial law aiming to crackdown on online offences ranging from harassment to child pornography. Ressa's team has argued the legislation did not take affect until months after the story was published and is not retroactive, however the government has countered that it is fair game because the story was updated in 2014. ""In essence in the contemplation of the law it is a new article because of the modification, republication,"" Markk Perete, spokesman for Department of Justice prosecutors, told AFP. ""That is deemed as a new article."" Rappler concedes the story was updated, but notes it was to fix a typo and no substantive changes were made. Duterte has lashed out at other critical media outfits, including the Philippine Daily Inquirer newspaper and broadcaster ABS-CBN. He had threatened to go after their owners over alleged unpaid taxes or block the network's franchise renewal application. Some of the drug crackdown's highest-profile detractors have wound up behind bars, including Senator Leila de Lima, who was jailed on drug charges she insists were fabricated to silence her. Ressa insists the site is not anti-Duterte, saying it is just doing its job to hold the government to account."

											Time to end the detention of children										",https://search.bangkokpost.com/track/visitAndRedirect?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bangkokpost.com%2Fopinion%2Fopinion%2F1619638%2Ftime-to-end-the-detention-of-children&contentId=news1619638,"The beginning of last week witnessed the signing ceremony of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on the Determination of Measures and Approaches Alternative to Detention of Children in Immigration Detention Centres by seven key agencies in Thailand, namely: the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Social Development, the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Labour and the national police (which deals with immigration). The much-awaited message is to end the detention of children who are in Thailand in breach of the national immigration law. Regrettably on many continents, children, whether accompanied by their families or not, find themselves in situations where they have crossed borders without the relevant travel documents, visas and or permission to enter another country. They are then classified directly or indirectly as ""illegal immigrants"" and land up in immigration detention. The MoU has been gestating for the past two years and there is now an improved text. On the positive front, the MoU now covers persons under 18 years of age and this is now more consistent with international standards. There are now six overriding principles guiding inter-agency cooperation. First, children are not to be detained, except as a measure of last resort and for the shortest possible time. Second, the best interests of the child are to prevail. Third, children in these situations are entitled to basic livelihood standards in keeping with their development. Fourth, priority is accorded to family-based care, while shelters run by the Social Development Ministry, complemented by privately run reception centres, can be resorted to as a last resort. Fifth, the child's physical and mental development should be taken into account, oriented to sustainable solutions. Sixth, the key agencies involved are to take appropriate measures to help the child. The status of the child is to be determined by an individualised screening process with multi-disciplinary teams, collecting personal records, ascertaining and providing appropriate care and services, and ensuring coordination between key agencies, aiming at return of the child to the family and society. The Thai setting invites connectivity with international trends and responses. At the Leaders' Summit hosted by the Obama administration in 2016 , the country pledged to end the detention of children in immigration situations. This was paralleled by the summit held in New York in the same year which adopted a global declaration, highlighting that ""migration should be a choice and not a necessity"". These were followed up in 2018 by the almost universal adoption of the Global Compact on Refugees and the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration (The Migration Compact). The former is particularly linked with the role of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, while the latter interlinks closely with the International Organisation for Migration. The commitment particularly in the Migration Compact under its Objective 13 headed ""Use immigration detention only as a measure of last resort and work towards alternatives"" spearheads action "" working to end the practice of child detention in the context of international migration"". From the angle of child rights, that premise is a basic minimum and the global community should strive to end the detention of children in such situation altogether -- preferably not leaving the door open to detention as a last resort. The more advanced position is now offered under the Convention on the Rights of the Child, particularly through various stipulations from its monitoring body, the Committee on the Rights of the Child. In 2017, that committee, in cooperation with another UN Committee, issued two General Comments to guide the global community, namely the Joint Comment No 4 and General Comment No 23 on State Obligations regarding the Human Rights of Children in the Context of International Migration, stating that ""any kind of child immigration detention should be forbidden by law"" and that "" children should not be criminalised or subjected to punitive measures, such as detention, because of their or their parents' migration status"". There is the additional stipulation that ""criminalising irregular entry and stay exceeds the legitimate interest of States parties to control and regulate migration, and leads to arbitrary detention"". Thus the preferred orientation is to advance the position of the new MoU by implementing the guidance from the Committee of the Rights of the Child to end the detention of children in immigration situations absolutely and without exceptions. Other challenges invite more concrete responses from the national authorities as follows: First, the rationale of immigration law and policy needs to be reassessed. Immigration related breaches should not be seen as criminal offences, but they should be treated as administrative breaches, not leading to criminal sanctions such as detention. Second, the issue of family reunion should be underlined. The tendency in recent years was to shift young children and mothers to social development shelters but to keep the fathers and adolescent male children in immigration detention. The adoption of the ""whole-of-the-family"" approach would help to keep all the family together rather than dividing them. Third, there is the danger that when young male children reach the age of 18, they might be treated as adults and then returned to immigration detention. The preferred position is not to (re-) detain them but to enable them to continue in shelters as part of sustainable solutions. Fourth, currently bail is at times imposed as a condition (particularly for the release of adults) and the sums required are high. The sums required for bail should be reduced, and in the case of children, no bail should be required at all, since they should be considered innocents not subjected to crime-related sureties and sanctions. Fifth, while the MoU provides clearer guidance for inter-agency cooperation, the standard operating procedures of what to do, when, how and with whom and/or for whom are also critically important to step up action for child sensitive and effective implementation. The adoption of the MoU should thus be viewed as an initial stepping stone which needs to be enhanced and reinforced with other measures, bearing in mind the new avenues advocated by the international law of child rights and the shared responsibility of stakeholders.

The Polish Catholic Church apologised four years ago for crimes of paedophilia committed by its members. According to the victim's association ""Don't be afraid"", there have been 56 convictions in recent years, including for possession of child pornography.

It has been complemented by a spate of court cases against human traffickers, with some evident successes. Yet, there remains a challenging situation, particularly where children are the victims, compounded by the complexity of a transfrontier situation and the opacity of the vested interests behind the sex market. The country is now supported by an extensive policy and legal framework which provides the tools to take action. Thailand is a party to the main international treaty on the subject of human trafficking -- the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children, supplementing the UN Convention against Transnational Organised Crime (2000) (""Palermo Protocol""). This treaty defines ""trafficking in persons"" as comprising three elements; the criminal act (such as recruitment or transfer of a victim); the means used (such as coercion, deception or abuse of power); and the purpose based on exploitation (such as sexual exploitation and forced labour). In the case of child victims, however, it is not necessary to prove the second element (the means) and absolute protection is afforded to persons under 18 years old. Importantly, consent of the victim to the trafficking (whether adult or child) is immaterial, and the trafficker cannot use consent to rebut the claims of the victim. Furthermore, the Palermo Protocol calls for criminalisation of human trafficking, victim protection, safe repatriation, and prevention and cooperation measures, such as on border security. Implementation of this treaty in Thailand has been witnessed by the enactment of the Act on Prevention and Suppression of Trafficking in Persons (2008), with two subsequent amendments, most recently the Anti-Trafficking Act (2017). These laws follow the Palermo Protocol, while providing additions based on the Thai situation. In particular, the 2017 law spells out the notion of abuse of authority by bearing in mind the victim's physical and mental condition as well as educational level. Progressively, there has also been an increase in sanctions (fines, imprisonment and even the death penalty). In 2016, a law was also passed to lay down the procedures for dealing with human trafficking cases, with the establishment of court(s) to deal specifically with the crime of human trafficking, conferring more powers on the judges to undertake investigations (""inquisitorial role""), as well as expedited procedures targeting finalisation of cases in six months. These are supported by various national policies, most recently the human rights agenda adopted by the current administration, as well as the commitment to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. There is also a range of other laws that intersect with the anti-trafficking law, such as the Anti-Prostitution Act (1960) and the Criminal Code, remembering that the country is a party to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and its protocols. In cross-border cases, national immigration law comes into play. However, the immigration law stands astride the thin line between victim and wrongdoer; where a person crosses into Thailand without the proper papers and where it is unclear whether the person is a victim of human trafficking, such law might classify the person as an illegal immigrant, consequently leading to immigration detention. Nevertheless, there are now various Memoranda of Understanding between government and other agencies to shift victims of trafficking from the immigration authorities to the social welfare authorities and to house victims in the latter's shelters. A key challenge is how to identify the victims and how to ascertain their age, particularly to enable adequate protection to be accorded to children. While under the current national law and related procedure, the identification of the victim should be finalised within a week, this is hampered when it is not clear whether the person is under 18 years old. Should the age of the person be assessed through tests on the bones or teeth? Experiences from other regions, such as Europe, question the accuracy of tests based on bones/teeth, as there is a possible margin of error concerning the actual age of the person. What should not be forgotten is the need to consult the child, examine the background circumstances, and access the family to help confirm the age. In today's world, technology can also help, such as online communication with the country of origin and local communities. This is linked with situations where the victim claims to be over 18, when the reality may suggest otherwise. The interview process needs to be sensitive to the trauma already faced by the child and the pressures which may cause the child to be evasive, including over their real age, due to fear and apprehension. The environment facing the child may also inhibit the truth-seeking process: An interview at a police station hoping for quick results may be inappropriate if what the victim really needs is a comforting shelter to recover in before evidence-gathering begins. What if the person accused of exploiting a child claims that the latter had stated that they were over 18 and the accused believed them at the time of the incident, in addition to the fact that the person consented to the act of exploitation? The mere fact that a child claims that they are over 18 should not be definitive, and the presumption -- and benefit of the doubt -- should weigh in favour of the child. This is now the judicial position in other parts of the world; the accused is under strict liability to the child, irrespective of the latter's claim of being over 18 years old. Add to that the global position today that criminal responsibility arises in trafficking cases, irrespective of whether the victim consents to the act of exploitation.

The five suspects were nabbed when police from Thailand's Action Taskforce for Information Technology Crime Suppression Center (Tactics) searched Jin Hao Tai International Trade Co, Pol Maj Gen Surachate Hakparn, the acting chief of the Immigration Bureau, said yesterday. The company sold dried fruit, bird nests and rubber pillows, and used Thais as fake shareholders. ""The Thais acted as nominees for the foreign investor, an economic crime that affects Thai people,"" Pol Maj Gen Surachate said, adding the offenders ran afoul of the Foreign Business Act. Pol Maj Gen Surachate, who also serves as the deputy director of Tactics, was briefing the media on the results of a series of crackdowns. He said that over the last week as many as 16 people had been arrested in connection with a romance scam while another four had been busted for call centre fraud. All of the offenders are Thai. Officers have since returned the swindled money to two of the people who were allegedly duped by both networks. The first victim in Samut Prakan got taken for 400,165 baht by the call centre gang. Officers were able to freeze and recoup 190,000 baht of this. Another victim in Khon Kaen was defrauded out of 256,000 baht by the romance scam syndicate. All of the sum has now been frozen, police said. Pol Maj Gen Surachate said the Anti-Money Laundering Office (Amlo), financial institutes and Royal Thai Police are working tirelessly to tackle fraud gangs. Those who think they have been cheated can contact Amlo seven days a week by calling 1710, he said. Officers have also apprehended two Thais for allegedly sexually abusing young boys in Pattaya, he added. After being alerted to what was happening, police raided their room and seized their phones, tablets and computers. In a separate case, an Austrian man has been apprehended in Chiang Mai after police found troves of child pornography on his devices."

Kittipong Kittayarak, the executive director of the Thailand Institute of Justice (TIJ), said that a collaborative study carried out by the TIJ and the UN Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute shows that nefarious activities involving transnational organised crime are rising in Thailand. They include ID cards and travel document forgery, money laundering, drug smuggling, human trafficking, call centre scams, and credit card information theft. The study also identifies challenges faced by Thai agencies involved in the justice system. ""This includes human resource constraints, a lack of effective inter-agency communication due to officials' lack of proficiency in foreign languages, and bureaucratic red tape,"" said Mr Kittipong, a former permanent secretary for justice. At a seminar titled ""Advancing the Economy and Combating Crime in the Digital Age: Cryptocurrency and Crime"", which was jointly held by the TIJ and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), Mr Kittipong said Thailand still needs to work on developing technologies and innovations as tools to combat transnational crimes, particularly cybercrime involving the use of cryptocurrencies. He said the UNODC has revealed that many criminal gangs have used cryptocurrencies to launder money and provide financial support for terrorists. Cryptocurrencies have also been used to pay kidnap ransoms, and buy child pornography, illicit drugs, malware and firearms on the dark web, whose popularity is rising among criminal gangs, Mr Kittipong said. Currently, there are not many criminal cases involving cryptocurrencies, but such crimes are expected to rise quickly in the near future, he said. Deputy Prime Minister and Justice Minister Prajin Juntong said the government has set up the National Cyber Security Committee, chaired by Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha. However, he admitted that the committee still lacks knowledge and the experience to administer computer servers. It is necessary to learn and build up networks to work together to prevent cybercrime, he said. Julien Garsany, the UNODC's deputy regional representative for Southeast Asia and the Pacific, said that more than 6 billion cybercrime cases occur in the region annually. Criminal gangs have reaped 100 billion baht of profits from illegal transactions, while causing about 150 billion baht of damage to the regional economy each year, Mr Garsany said. A recent bitcoin scandal in which a Finnish investor and a Thai businesswoman were swindled out of almost 800 million baht worth of bitcoins is a case in point. The Crime Suppression Division has pressed fraud charges against five suspects, which include 27-year-old actor Jiratpisit ""Boom"" Jaravijit, and his brother Prinya Jiratpisit who according to police, masterminded the scam. Bitcoins were used to buy stocks which the victims claimed they never received. Mr Prinya reportedly fled to the US just as the scam came to public attention."

The report is thought to be the most comprehensive to date into abuse in the US church, but while prosecutors have filed charges against two priests, the vast majority of crimes happened too long ago to prosecute under current laws	 The report is thought to be the most comprehensive to date into abuse in the US church, but while prosecutors have filed charges against two priests, the vast majority of crimes happened too long ago to prosecute under current laws. The report said testimony from dozens of witnesses and half a million pages of internal church documents contained credible allegations against more than 300 predator priests and more than 1,000 child victims were identifiable. But the real number was ""in the thousands,"" the grand jury estimated following an exhaustive, two-year investigation, given those children whose records were lost or who were afraid to come forward. One cleric raped a seven-year-old girl in hospital after she had her tonsils out, the report said. Another child drank juice, only to wake up the next morning bleeding from his rectum and unable to remember what had happened. The vast majority of victims were boys and many were pre-pubescent, some manipulated with alcohol or pornography, and some were raped and groped, the report summarized. Many of the priests are dead. So far only two new priests are being charged with crimes that fall within the statute of limitations. One allegedly ejaculated in the mouth of a seven-year-old and the other assaulted two boys for years until 2010. ""The pattern was abuse, deny and cover up. The effect, not only victimized children, it served a legal purpose that church officials manipulated for their advantage,"" Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro told reporters. - 'Hid it all' - ""As a direct consequence of the systematic cover-up by senior church officials almost every instance of child sexual abuse we found is too old to be prosecuted."" The grand jury called for changes in the law that would scrap the statute of limitations for child sex abuse, give victims more time to file civil lawsuits and tighten legislation compelling people to report abuse they find out about. ""Despite some institutional reform, individual leaders of the church have largely escaped public accountability,"" the report said. ""Priests were raping little boys and girls, and the men of God who were responsible for them not only did nothing; they hid it all. For decades."" Between 5,700 and 10,000 Catholic priests have been accused of sexual abuse in the United States, but only a few hundred have been tried, convicted, and sentenced for their crimes, according to the watchdog Bishop Accountability. Since the abuse crisis became public in the 2000s, the US church has spent more than $3 billion in settlements, according to Bishop Accountability. The group has documented settlements for 5,679 alleged victims of Catholic clergy -- only a third of 15,235 allegations that bishops say they have received through 2009. One estimate suggests up there were 100,000 US victims. A grand jury investigation into the Pennsylvania diocese of Altoona-Johnstown, one of those omitted in Tuesday's report, revealed in 2016 that two bishops spent four decades covering up sexual abuse of hundreds of children. The number of 300 predator priests detailed in Tuesday's report dwarfs the estimates of 150-250 in identified since 2002 in Boston, Massachusetts."

The suspects were caught on court warrants for supporting the flesh trade and depriving boys aged below 18 of parental care, said Pol Maj Gen Kornchai Khlaikhlueng, commander of the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Division (ATPD), during a media briefing on Tuesday. Pol Maj Gen Surachate Hakparn, deputy chief of the Tourist Police Bureau and senior police officers, were also present. ATPD investigators have pressed charges against the eight suspects and sent them to the Criminal Court. They were granted bail on a bond of 300,000 baht each. Pol Maj Gen Kornchai said the customers included celebrities and university lecturers or officials, but the names would not be disclosed. Several phuyai (senior figures) had phoned him and asked that a media conference not be held for fear the names of the customers would be made public, he said. “One suspect works at an organisation overseeing legal officials and another teaches other people. Both have wives and children, but they abused underprivileged children,’’ said Pol Maj Gen Kornchai. Earlier, a combined team of police and officials from the ATPD, the Tourist Police Bureau, the Ministry of Social Development and Human Security, and non-governmental organisations jointly launched a crackdown on online sex networks providing services by boys aged below 18.  The operation led to the arrest of Namphon Somngam, alias New, 27. He was allegedly an agent and owner of “Rak Dek’’ (Love children) Line chat group. Mr Namphon has been charged with human trafficking by procuring boys aged not more than 18 into the fresh trade and disseminating child pornography into the computer system for gains.  Police took him to the Criminal Court last week and opposed his bail, said Pol Maj Gen Kornchai. Pol Col Khomkrit Sukthai, of the ATPD, said Mr Namphon used to work as a manager of a convenience store in Bangkok before quitting the job.  The suspect, who police say is also a paedophile, then opened a Facebook account “Namphon Somngam’’ to accept members who liked to watch child porn chips with a membership fee of 300 baht each. The suspect later created the Line chat group “Rak Dek’’ for these members. The man charged membership fees of over 500 baht for viewing porn clips of boys. Those who wanted to have sex with them would be charged 1,500 baht each and Mr Namphon would deduct 500 baht for his brokerage fees, said Pol Col Khomkrit. His arrest led to the rescue of seven boys, aged between 12-16, who later identified the customers, said Pol Maj Gen Kornchai. A source said two of the eight customers caught for buying sex services from boys were a well-known lecturer at a university in Nakhon Pathom and the other was an official attached to the Probation Department."

Even experienced police officers dealing with child abuse cases said the case was like nothing they had ever seen Following a criminal probe that even seasoned investigators said pushed them to the emotional limit, the regional court in Freiburg sentenced the boy's mother, Berrin Taha, to 12 and a half years in prison. Her partner Christian Lais, the boy's stepfather whom he called ""papa"", received a 12-year sentence followed by preventive detention. Lais, 39, was allowed to live in their home despite a previous conviction for child abuse and a court order to stay away from minors. The judges found that the unemployed couple had sexually assaulted the boy, now 10, numerous times and pimped him on the so-called darknet between May 2015 and August 2017. They were convicted of rape, aggravated sexual assault of children, forced prostitution and distribution of child pornography, judge Stefan Buergelin said. The couple was also ordered to pay a total of €42,500 in damages to the boy and another victim, a girl who was temporarily in their care. Taha, 48, said through her lawyer that she would not appeal, in order to spare her son an even longer legal ordeal. 'Vague' abuse suspicions dismissed Their sentences fell short of what prosecutors had demanded -- 14 years and six months for Taha and 13 years and six months for Lais. Even experienced police officers dealing with child abuse cases said the case was like nothing they had ever seen. Local judicial and child services officials came in for massive criticism for having interviewed the mother after concerns about the boy's welfare arose months before the couple's arrest but failing to get his own account. Key information about the case was not shared among authorities, and warnings from the boy's school about his wellbeing were dismissed by youth services as ""vague"". On Monday, the same court sentenced a Spanish paedophile, Javier Gonzalez Diaz, to 10 years' prison for repeatedly sexually abusing the young boy after paying the parents. The 33-year-old was also ordered to pay €18,000 to the young victim. The case came to light following an anonymous tip-off last September, and led to the arrest of eight people who have been charged with belonging to an online paedophile ring. Police said they have another 20 suspected perpetrators in their sights. 'Owe it to this child' Lais admitted on the witness stand to the assaults on the boy. He also made serious accusations against the child's mother, who confessed to the crimes but remained largely silent about any possible motive during the trial. In his verdict, Buergelin said Taha went along with the abuse at first so she would not lose Lais as a partner and later ""for financial motives"". They charged several thousand euros for each instance of abuse, filmed the acts and posted them on the darknet. The boy is in foster care and did not have to testify during the trial. His lawyer told reporters Tuesday that he was doing well ""under the circumstances"". The German government's ombudsman for child sexual abuse issues, Joahnnes-Wilhelm Roerig, said the case had ""laid bare a series of errors of judgement and shortcomings"" by local, state and federal authorities. ""We owe it to this child to draw the right conclusions,"" he said, including improving cooperation between services, staffing and training. He said in a statement that an official report on what went wrong in the case, compiled by judges and youth office staff, would be presented in September and include a list of recommendations for future policy. Roerig also noted an official bias presuming that a mother would never sexually assault her own child, despite the fact that an estimated 10% to 20% of abusers are female."

""The organisation purports to publicly disseminate classified, sensitive, and confidential information,"" the Justice Department said in a statement, which added that the organisation released the information on March 7, 2017. On that day, WikiLeaks called the release ""the largest ever publication of confidential documents by the agency."" It said that the documents had come from the Central Intelligence Agency's Center for Cyber Intelligence in Langley, Virginia. ""Leaks of classified information pose a danger to the security of all Americans,"" Assistant Attorney General John Demers said in a statement. ""Schulte utterly betrayed this nation and downright violated his victims."" Joshua Adam Schulte, shown here in personal photographs eating cake and at the front of the White House, has been charged with leaking cyber tools to WikiLeaks. In addition to stealing highly classified secrets, Schultz illegally accessed a US computer system, attempted to delete his digital activity and then lied to FBI investigators, according to the 13-page indictment. Federal agents who had been investigating the theft of classified material ""also discovered alleged child pornography in Schulte's New York City residence,"" the indictment said. He has plead not guilty to those charges, according to reports by various news organisations. Court papers don't specify the nature of the documents Schulte allegedly stole. He is being held in federal custody in New York, according to court records. His lawyer didn't immediately return an email seeking a comment on the charges. Schulte worked at the National Security Agency from January to May 2010 and for the Central Intelligence Agency from May 2010 to November 2016. After he left the CIA, he worked briefly for Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News, leaving the company in March 2017."

Peter Scully still faces another trial and dozens more charges, including allegations he made child pornography and murdered a young girl. The Philippines has become a key hub for a billion-dollar, global child cybersex industry, police have warned, with operators helped by widespread poverty. Scully was convicted Wednesday of trafficking and rape by a court in the southern Philippines, three years after he was arrested there and accused of sexually abusing and filming girls including an 18-month-old baby. The Cagayan de Oro court sentenced Scully and his Filipina partner to life in prison without parole and imposed a fine of 5 million pesos ($93,700) for trafficking Filipina girls then aged 10 and 12, the regional prosecutor said. ""This is a big victory for us. This sends a very strong signal to traffickers that this government is serious in pursuing and prosecuting these cases,"" Merlynn Uy, officer-in-charge of the regional prosecutor's office, told AFP. ""These girls were lured into his apartment and they said that they were chained on the neck, like dogs on a leash."" Scully was also found guilty of rape, which carries a minimum of six years behind bars. He was arrested in 2015 in Malaybalay, another southern Philippine city, after fleeing from Australia in 2011. He had come to the Philippines to escape fraud charges in his home country. He then set up a cybersex business, filming teenage girls from impoverished families as he had sex with them or used sex toys, investigators said. The videos were allegedly sold to customers in Germany, the United States and Brazil. Most of the people who pay to view these types of sex videos are abroad, with potentially thousands of children being abused, often with their parents' consent, authorities said. Scully faces another trial for a second batch of 60 charges including the rape of an 18-month-old baby girl and the rape and murder of a 12-year-old girl. It is not clear when those proceedings will start. The Social Welfare Department said Scully's victims remained in government custody. ""The children have been traumatised. We provide them therapy to help them prepare for a normal life,"" regional social welfare director Nestor Ramos told AFP. Australia's foreign affairs department told AFP it was providing consular assistance to Scully but declined to comment further citing ""privacy obligations""."

Kelly songs in its playlists or user recommendations, after the Time's Up movement for gender equality urged the music business to dump the R&B star over sexual abuse allegations. R. Kelly -- real name Robert Sylvester Kelly -- has been accused of sexual abuse dating back years, but was acquitted of the only charge brought against him The move marks the first application of Spotify's new policy on ""Hate Content & Hateful Conduct,"" which states an artist's behavior may result in changes in how Spotify promotes their content. ""When an artist or creator does something that is especially harmful or hateful (for example, violence against children and sexual violence), it may affect the ways we work with or support that artist or creator,"" a spokesperson for the Swedish streaming service said. Users of both the free and subscription-based versions of Spotify will still be able to find R. Kelly's music on the service. However, he will no longer appear in playlists curated by the platform or algorithm-generated recommendations. ""We don't censor content because of an artist's or creator's behavior, but we want our editorial decisions -- what we choose to program -- to reflect our values,"" the spokesperson added. A representative for R. Kelly said in a statement carried by various US media outlets that there was no basis for the move by Spotify and that R. Kelly is innocent of the allegations against him. ""R. Kelly never has been accused of hate, and the lyrics he writes express love and desire,"" the statement said. ""He is innocent of the false and hurtful accusations in the ongoing smear campaign against him,"" it said. R. Kelly -- real name Robert Sylvester Kelly -- is accused of sexual abuse against young women and underage girls dating back over a decade, but he has never been convicted. The ""I Believe I Can Fly"" singer and producer, who is 51, was charged with child pornography offenses in 2002, but was acquitted in 2008. According to a BuzzFeed investigation published last July, Kelly is also accused of holding six women in virtual slavery at his homes in Chicago and Atlanta, with power over their clothing, diet and sexual encounters. He has not been charged, however, and has denied all the allegations. Meanwhile, in April, police in Dallas, Texas, opened an investigation into allegations Kelly gave a 19-year-old girl a sexually transmitted disease without telling her. At the end of April, the Time's Up movement -- created in the wake of a watershed of sexual harassment allegations involving powerful men across several industries -- demanded that all these allegations be investigated appropriately. The organization also called upon several music industry heavyweights, including streaming services, as well as Kelly's record label to cut ties with him. ""It may be a cultural milestone,"" Larry Miller, clinical music associate professor and director of the music business programme at NYU Steinhardt, said of Spotify's decision. ""There's no question that Spotify's curated playlists... are bigger and more influential and more listened to than any radio station on earth,"" he said. ""So it's not an overstatement to say that this is likely to have a significant effect on the amount of listening that happens around R. Kelly's catalog for a period of time."""

									Re: ""Walls close in on free press"", (Editorial, April 6).								 Blasphemous? When hoary myths are elevated to forced ideology worthy of the most zealous cult of fanatics intent on protecting their sacred dogmas from generously perceived insult, they threaten both reason and good morals. The Chiang Mai governor, like the terrorising law he uses to attack reasonable social use of their cultural heritage by citizens who are equally members of society, needs to grow up. If he dislikes healthy satire, he should not watch it. Better yet, he should respond in kind to correct what believes are misunderstandings or unjust uses of cultural relics. But to be fair, it is precisely because the facts and reason often fail to support any such cheerful rebuttal that suppression absent reason must be resorted to. To use the law to silence different opinions proves only that the law is profoundly anti-democratic in its moral corruption. But this has always been the way of self-anointing dictators, who cannot survive if their dubious myths are subject to honest truth seeking and speaking, and who must therefore suppress honest critical reasoning that might inconveniently expose naked truths to social awareness. Its abuses consistent with the very etymology of the word show, however much it might pretend to care for good morals and reason, the ugly reality that the office of dictator is as morally corrupt in principle as it typically is in practice: it has never been otherwise. FELIX QUI Recent events involving the aberrant behaviour of many government officials have once again shown that the hierarchical, bureaucratic society of Thailand is not compatible with an equitable justice system. High-ranking officials, top politicians and the very wealthy just don't get the same treatment as the common citizen. This inequality is built into a system that not only survived the 1932 coup but stayed firmly in place for the various successive coups and attempts at reform since. Many countries decided that equality, liberty and justice was the proper way to approach a modern society but Thailand has so far refused that option. To many young Thais it is quite obvious that a certain general doesn't believe he should be judged and its also clear that the anti-corruption body isn't in a position to do so. Several high-ranking ex-politicians have avoided judgement by running off with the public believing they had official help to do so. Even when caught red-handed, officials get such lenient treatment that it beggars belief, with inactive posts, transfers or dismissal with pension being laughably suggested as punishment. With bureaucratic officials locked in this 19th-century mindset, I see no hope for the changes necessary for Thailand to join the modern, computerised, robotic world that we are headed for. The very mention of a lawyer, who has discussed the need to reform lese majeste, being involved with a modern political party has already brought death threats and complaints from the well-entrenched dinosaurs who still think a senior position in the military is a lifelong guarantee of riches. Surely one day things have to change. LUNGSTIBChiang Mai Re: ""Deaths not a fluke"", (PostBag, April 6). Peter from Kalasin writes about being taken to a private hospital in Khon Kaen to be treated for a liver fluke infection. One might say Khon Kaen is the epicentre of this problem in Thailand, with some villages having an infection rate of 94% or 100% in those over the age of 10! While fortunate to receive a proper diagnosis, the price Peter paid for his medication, 13,000 baht, sounds like he was severely overcharged. Generally speaking, and if possible, it is advisable to obtain the prescription and then purchase the medications from a private pharmacy rather than the one in the hospital. This strategy can result in savings of up to 90%. MICHAEL SETTERChon Buri Re: ""Faster roads bid gets a green light"", (BP, April 6). In reality, most drivers on Thai highways exceed the existing limit of 90kph, for which law enforcement has got out of hand. I don't agree with raising the limit on highways because most of them have not been designed, constructed or maintained to handle these higher speeds, while the skills and manners of Thai drivers are not appropriate for high-speed driving. This move seems to defend the the inability of traffic police to enforce the law. Moreover, I suggest setting a lower speed limit for smaller roads of around 30km/h. RH SUGALamphun What is it the Thai authorities and the general public have against pedestrians? It would seem that if you walk, you are some sort of lowlife not worthy of respect because you don't own a vehicle. Even where there are pavements, usually in a poor state, they are mostly cluttered with permanent street furniture, rubbish bins, signs, stalls, bike taxi boys, etc. causing people to walk on the road. Bike riders have no regard for pedestrians. Bikes are often parked on the pavement, as well as riding along it. They block entrances to shops even when parked on the road. They aggressively cut in front of folk when about to park or when pulling out. None of this is news, but driven (pun intended!) home by a building site on the second road in Pattaya which has taken up the pavement. But instead of coning off an area for pedestrians to walk safely along, there is nothing. Cars park next to the site, forcing pedestrians to walk out into the busy traffic. This lack of thought sums up the authorities' attitude to pedestrians, the lowest of the low! MOTOGUZZIBOB I live near Klong Saen Saep in Bangkok. I use the boat service there quite often. What I lately realised, alerted by the bad air-quality warnings, is that the boats' diesel engines belch out enormous amounts of black toxic fumes. I think it's time that operators of these boats upgrade their exhaust systems. Maybe they could even get some funds from the city government. KARL REICHSFETTER Re: ""No hell below us, above us only sky"", (Opinion, April 5). It is very true that those who grow up inside the bubble of faith will believe in whatever doctrines they are exposed to. It is just like being exposed to a contagious infection. Those pious men and women who believe there is something beyond the blue sky or something below the surface of the earth are missing out on the opportunity to fully enjoy their life in the most beautiful place we know -- the planet Earth. Fortunately, we also know a lot about the geology of the Earth but we know very little about the cosmos. Buddha once said, ""When the average ignorant person makes an assertion to the effect that there is a hell [patala] under the ocean, he is making a statement which is false and without basis. The word hell is a term for painful sensations. The idea of one particular ready-made place or a place created by God as heaven and hell is not acceptable as a concept."" Since we are living in a Buddhist country, we should appreciate the fact that we are already in heaven. So far, nobody has come back from hell or heaven to share their wisdom with us. In other words, hell and heaven are within our existence. As far as we know, the Earth is the only place with fauna and flora. The rest of the cosmos is made of freezing dark spaces, black holes, asteroids and burning infernos. KULDEEP NAGI The White House claims that expelling 60 Russian diplomats at one time is the biggest feast in modern US history. US President Donald Trump also claimed during a meeting with the heads of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania at the White House on Tuesday: ""Nobody has been tougher on Russia than me."" However, observers are claiming President Trump has never once been tough on Russia -- especially its alleged attempt to meddle in the 2016 US presidential election. Mr Trump also failed to condemn Russia's alleged role in poisoning a former Russian spy in Britain recently. In fact, former US presidents John F Kennedy and Ronald Reagan have been much tougher on Russia: When they visited Germany, both condemned Russia for building the Berlin Wall that divided Germany into two countries. Both presidents offered hope and encouragement to the German people as well as challenged Russia to ""tear down the Berlin Wall"". Not long after their visits, the Berlin Wall was demolished. Hence, JFK and Reagan have been true tough American Presidents on Russia -- while Mr Trump has done absolutely nothing of comparable dimension. CHAVALIT WANNAWIJITRChiang Mai It is an absolute lie for Robin Grant to say that the Palestinians refuse to negotiate with Israel (Postbag, April 2). But how can Mahboud Abbas, who even the Israelis admit is a moderate Palestinian leader, negotiate with the Israelis when they continue to spread the settlements in the occupied territory and thus steal the very land they're suppose to be negotiating over? Grant suggests that the Israelis murdered these Palestinians in self-defence when one victim was an unarmed legless man in a wheelchair and another was praying at the time. These protests are a direct result of Donald Trump's announcement to move the US Embassy to Jerusalem. Thus Mr Trump, as well as his apologists, are as responsible for these deaths as the soldiers who pulled the triggers. ERIC BAHRTChiang Mai Canadian federal politics is providing no direction for ordinary citizens. PM Justin Trudeau, since his disastrous India tour, has been locked in a war of words with the opposition trying to salvage the dignity and reputation of his government, party and suspicious ministers and MPs with questionable connections with religious hardliners, convicted terrorists and other shady elements. Mr Trudeau is more concerned about himself and his party, not Canada. On the other hand, his new National Democratic Party (NDP) contender for the 2019 election, Jagmeet Singh, seems to be deliberately mixing religion with politics to woo certain voters from the liberal camp for petty electoral gains. Unfortunately, he seems to be more focused on issues in India and the US than in Canada. He is repeatedly failing to demonstrate that he represents the whole of Canada and not just his ethnic community and the NDP Party. Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer is a good orator but his ability to lead this great nation is rightly questioned. He often seems to be venturing into la la land with no definite objective. Words cannot win votes, but actions can. Under these circumstances, as a proud Canadian I feel we are seriously suffering a credible leadership crisis from coast to coast as none of the big three in Canada seem to be thinking about Canada and Canadians while trapped in their personal, narrow voter-appeasement box. SAIKAT KUMAR BASUCanada I have been shocked to see an increase in programmes promoting America's understanding of sex trafficking. First, I photographed a billboard which simply said, ""Stop Child Pornography"" with logos for both the FBI and Department of Homeland Security. There were also two logos for Thai government agencies. Of course, concern about child pornography might seem like a no-brainer but is there any reason to think there is a problem so big the US must get involved in Thailand's business? Second, I was surprised to see a group at the entry to Asok MRT station handing out flyers and showing an inflammatory video to school children walking by. These kind of ""awareness programmes"", begun in 2000 by former US President Bush, have been very well funded ever since, if not by Washington then by conservative moralists. In America, awareness programmes effectively spread fear and now Thai people are getting in on the action! JOHN KANE

Those charges were discontinued as the court found that the law did not specify what penalties should apply for such alleged actions. Detectives discovered more than 10 pieces of frozen female genitalia at Frederiksen's Bloemfontein home in September 2015.

It was an encounter that I never expected, and it was a meeting that changed the way I view the world. It wasn't for anything regal or fancy. It was for something much more profound. Queen Silvia, visiting as the founder and chairman of the World Childhood Foundation, was in Thailand with her team to shine light on the issue of child sex abuse. It's a gut-wrenching topic to talk about, but in order to create any positive change to the situation, we need to know what's going on. Worldwide, one in five girls and one in 10 boys are subject to sexual abuse. Nineteen percent of those children are raped when under 18 years old, 71% in their preteens (under 13), and most disturbingly, 10% are infants under four years of age. Thailand, as many (wilfully ignorant politicians and corrupt officials) aren't willing to admit, has been a paradise for paedophiles worldwide. We have a strong reputation for engaging in one of the largest child sex abuse operations in Southeast Asia, and according to Unicef, it estimates that the number of Thai children involved in this horrid industry are between 60,000 and 200,000 children. Making matters worse, of course, is the internet. The ""deep web"", as it's called, is a cesspit of the most vile materials this world has to offer. According to a study of child sex abuse material (aka ""child pornography"") by the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), paedophile web boards are growing, getting more violent and targeting younger and younger victims. In the presentation, which I attended, the UNODC presented a censored photo-album of two adult men raping a two-year-old boy. Is your blood boiling now? Faced with information like this, all I can ask is why? Why would anyone do this? Why is it increasing in number? And why isn't anything being done about this? It seems like a hopeless fight, but there may be a silver lining. In 2015, after 10 years of campaigning by lawmakers, Thailand's National Legislative Assembly passed a penal code amendment to criminalise the possession, sharing and production of child sexual abuse material. We are the first Southeast Asian country to make child sexual abuse material illegal -- aligning with many other developed countries in the world. And the only thing left is to implement it. Yet, as Thailand's judicial processes go, it's been a slow start. A few arrests have been made, including a suspected member of a large Japanese paedophile ring. What needs to happen is for this trend to continue. Judges, police, prosecutors, lawyers and judges need to work together and secure implementation of the law. They need to use their brains and their hearts to convict these abusers -- as time and time again, they are bailed out to do the exact same thing. By locking them up, it will show that Thailand doesn't tolerate child sex abuse anymore. And as Thailand becomes an increasingly ageing society, children are what's left of the country's hope and future. The trauma caused to these children leads to deep psychological scars, resulting in depression, drug and alcohol abuse, and even early death. If no one is willing to protect them now, what will their and the country's future become? If they believe that extra money in their pockets sounds better than protecting a child's life, then they'll definitely have a special place in hell to rot in. Thankfully, there are people like Queen Silvia and her heroic team paving the way to help children by removing them from their abusive environments and rebuilding their social fabric with amazing volunteers and social workers. As normal citizens we can also do something. If anyone comes across child pornography or circumstances that you suspect may include child sexual abuse, please, call the Thai Police at 1911, or make an online report at ThaiHotline.org. Make these people do their jobs. The Royal Thai Police has the Thailand Internet Crimes Against Children task force, supported by the FBI and US Homeland Security to combat sexual exploitation via the internet. We can't let abused children continue to suffer like this. Apipar Norapoompipat is a feature writer of the Life section of the Bangkok Post."

Time and again, Thailand has produced some incomprehensibly awful news headlines, and time and again, it seems like nothing is getting done. With women now getting their voices and stories heard in the powerful #MeToo and #TimesUp movements, it seems like we should also start focusing on those who are still voiceless: children. It is estimated that one in five girls and one in 10 boys are subject to sexual abuse around the world. According to Safeguardkids Thailand -- an organisation helping sexually abused children, 19% of those children are raped when under 18 years old, 71% in their preteens (under 13), and, most disturbing of all, 10% are infants under four years of age. Child-sex abuse is a serious and heinous crime. So serious that Her Majesty Queen Silvia of Sweden dropped by the Kingdom earlier this month to visit her programmes (Friends International and Child Safe Agents) and give a speech to 2,000 lay judges from the Juvenile and Family Courts of Thailand. As the founder and chairwoman of the World Childhood Foundation, Queen Silvia has been focusing on raising awareness and building projects globally to end these horrible crimes. The academic conference she spoke at was a gentle and diplomatic reminder to the lay judges of Thailand to do their duty and do it well, because in 2015, Thailand's National Legislative Assembly passed a penal code amendment to criminalise the possession, sharing and production of child sexual abuse material (unfortunately still known as child pornography) -- being the first Southeast Asian country to make child sexual abuse material illegal. Those who possess it will receive five years in prison; those who share it will get seven years; and those who produce it will get 10 years. ""[It] is excellent and you should be proud of it,"" Queen Silvia said in a rare, exclusive interview with the Elite the night before her speech. ""It's really wonderful ... and I'm sure other countries will follow your example."" Queen Silvia giving her speech to the audience of 2,000 lay judges − encouraging them to reach out and help children who have suffered sexual abuse. Banluechai Srinuan Often seen as a crime without a victim, we need to remember that behind the screen is an actual child suffering. Not only will the material traumatise the victim over and over again; furthermore, sexual abusers use these materials to convince other young children that such activity is normal. ""The internet is a very wonderful tool, but a very dangerous tool,"" Her Majesty said. ""There have been cases in Sweden as well. [A man] said he was 13 years old, but he was 45. He built up a kind of friendship on the internet and gave false identities. [He told them,] 'I would love to see you. Can we meet?'. Then he abused her. He did this with several girls. Fortunately they got hold of him. So it's very dangerous. And so we have to help."" She established her foundation in 1999, and there were many forces that compelled her to help these unfortunate children. ""We travel quite a lot, His Majesty and I,"" she said of herself and her husband the king. ""The whole time, I felt that perhaps I could do something myself. You know, we don't mingle in politics, but I could draw attention to certain questions. Many countries have been working a lot and have organisations to take care of street children, but nobody really dared to talk about sexual abuse."" ""Once, there was a big conference in Paris,"" she continued. ""I talked about the sexual abuse of children. I remember it was a huge hall. When I was speaking, everybody was curious and listening. But as soon as I talked about sexual abuse, I lost them. It was so shocking that I, as a woman and as a queen, was talking about sexual abuse. I told them, 'I know what you are thinking, and I have to tell you it's very difficult for me as well to talk about these subjects. But if we don't, then you can't change the situation. And who is suffering? The children'. But I am so happy that now the situation is different. Everybody talks about it. It's on their agenda all over the world,"" she said, referring to the United Nations meeting last year in September to discuss ending violence against children. ""You know, children, they are extraordinary,"" she said. ""In spite of everything which had happened to them, if you reach out with your hand, if they don't feel alone, you see in their eyes that they believe again in the future. That's a wonderful moment."" During the interview, Queen Silvia was humble and gentle, making everyone else in the room feel at ease. But the next day we saw another side -- strong, determined and steadfast. Speaking to an audience of 2,000, she spoke slowly and calmly. She talked about the World Childhood Foundation and her projects in Thailand. She congratulated the country on being a brave pioneer by passing the new law. Then, she gave some important reminders for everyone, not only the judges: ""The justice system is an important cornerstone in responding to child sex abuse,"" she said. ""Clear and strong legislation is a crucial starting point. But laws are only as powerful as their implementation and application. This requires awareness, knowledge and dedication. Therefore, I am especially happy for the gathering here today. This shows your commitment to protecting children in practice."" ""Children who have suffered abuse deserve that we not only use our brain,"" she continued, ""but also our heart when we engage to help them. Children need to know that we care. Ladies and gentlemen, you all have the opportunity, and indeed the responsibility, of being a caring adult, engaging both your brain and your heart for a child who has suffered abuse. You can give that child a voice."" If you come across child pornography or circumstances that you suspect may include child sexual abuse, call the Thai Police at 1911, or make an online report at ThaiHotline.org. You can also contact the Thailand Internet Crimes Against Children (TICAC) task force on Facebook or through ticac@police.go.th.

The work started out in Bangkok and has expanded to include Poipet at the Thai-Cambodia border. ""Through this project, more than 800 children and youth annually receive direct services aimed to protect them from abuse and integrate them into safe families, schools and communities. ""Furthermore, close to 80 so-called ChildSafe Agents have been educated. ChildSafe Agents are volunteers recruited to be the eyes and ears for children, watching out for their safety. ChildSafe Agents may be street vendors, tuk-tuk drivers or others trained and equipped to recognise and respond to situations of child abuse or distress."" — Queen Silvia in her speech ""When they launched their outreach programme, the only support available for families in need was in the form of orphanage care. That led to hundreds [650] of families effectively abandoning their children in the belief that it was the only available alternative that would give their child a better future. ""Now, our project offers these families a holistic programme that helps them stay together, which is better for the individual child, the family and the community. An important part of the project is to inform children and families about neglect and sexual abuse. Children learn to name their body parts. They get a chance to talk about good and bad secrets and what to do if someone touches them inappropriately, as well as to whom they can turn for help."" — Queen Silvia in her speech Her Majesty Queen Silvia at the Safeguardkids Foundation booth in Udon Thani.

Filipina Leslie Ann Fernandez, a co-accused in the case who was also sentenced to life, cried next to Shobbrook. Both were arrested during a 2013 operation in which 15 girls were rescued by Philippine authorities. According to the International Justice Mission, a global organization that partners with local authorities to fight human trafficking and child sexual abuse, the accused used the girls for pornographic images and videos that he then distributed online. The girls also testified that he offered them to other foreigners for sexual exploitation, according to the IJM."

Last month that the organisation re-entered the public spotlight, bringing down one of Bangkok's largest soapy massage parlours, Victoria's Secret, after the Department of Special Investigation (DSI) received information from them about the case of a Myanmar girl who had been lured into prostitution at the establishment. The operation then kicked off. The televised raid exposed gross human trafficking, underage prostitution and other suspected offences. Originally founded in New Zealand in 2011, Nvader (soon to be called LIFT International in April) prides itself on working towards strengthening justice structures, supporting victims and partnering with police to hold offenders accountable for crimes of human trafficking and child sexual exploitation. They are a registered charitable trust which depends solely on donations and public support. According to Nvader's director of Aftercare Janejinda Pawadee, who is a senior registered Thai social worker with over 15 years of experience in the area of human trafficking and child sexual exploitation, the Victoria's Secret trafficking case was different and somewhat challenging investigate. ""DSI and DOPA [Department Of Provincial Administration] identified minors being forced to provide sexual services to customers in the Victoria's Secret Soapy Massage Parlour, the youngest of which was only 12 years old. Many in Thai society believe that massage parlours such as Victoria's Secret employ only adult sex workers to provide sexual services to clients. However, the Victoria's Secret case exposed the fact that trafficking of children and minors still exists not only within small brothels and karaokes across Thailand, but also within these large massage business establishments,"" said Janejinda. ""Combating child trafficking must involve sensitivity, especially with regards to the egregious nature of the crime. Survivors have been placed in situations involving labour trafficking, sex trafficking, child pornography and extreme exploitation. In Thailand, the government is working to take a victim-centred approach, which is recommended by the US government and different international governing bodies."" When child victims give their testimony in court, there are good mechanisms that are in place such as child interview rooms and multidisciplinary teams to support child survivors including psychologists and social workers present during their interviews, Janejinda said. While shedding light on the reasons for their success, she said that because human trafficking involves organised criminal networks, to beat them at their own game, ""they believe it takes a network to effectively combat a network"". Janejinda has also seen a push in recent times towards greater collaboration and drawing upon everyone's core competencies and strengths in order to construct a united effort to fight trafficking. ""In order to address trafficking, we assist law enforcement to identify cases of forced labour, including forced prostitution, child begging, child sexual exploitation and child pornography,"" she said. ""Nvader works with local law enforcement agencies and receives requests for assistance directly from our partner government agencies. We work exclusively within legal frameworks with law enforcement partners in order to identify victims and perpetrators of trafficking. ""The core of Nvader's focus and strategy comes from the call for sharing resources to strengthen and grow capacity. Nvader also works in close partnership with grassroots NGOs in order to share information and provide care to survivors."" Janejinda said their team is comprised of qualified and experienced Thai national professionals, lawyers, investigators and social workers. They also prioritise assisting law enforcement agencies to identify and prosecute criminals. Prosecution is not just about apprehending criminals, she said, it's about more than keeping criminals behind bars. ""It has a much larger impact and effects that ripple outwards. It's about accountability: about showing traffickers that law enforcement is serious about apprehending them, that the criminal justice system is serious about prosecuting offenders and that the punishments will be commensurate to the crime. This in turn increases deterrence, which essentially comes via an increase in convictions of offenders of human trafficking."" Moreover, she said that one of Nvader's core focuses is to offer legal representation and aftercare to support and protect survivors throughout the criminal prosecution of their abusers all the way through to reintegration. Their teams advocate for the rights of survivors while simultaneously educating survivors of their rights and options. During police operations, she said their team plays a part in monitoring standards and practices, as well as overseeing the management and treatment of victims of trafficking to guarantee that their rights and dignity are respected. ""Nvader's lawyers pursue applications for court orders requiring those abusers to pay compensation directly to their victims. To date, Nvader has successfully claimed around 5.2 million baht in compensation for survivors,"" she said. Masseurs at Victoria's Secret Massage in Bangkok hide under towels during a raid by the DSI. Photo: Pattarapong Chatpattarasill Janejinda, who describes each and every human trafficking case as being complex, layered and requiring a nuanced approach, said that since 2014 Nvader has worked on child labour and begging, child sexual abuse, adults and children trafficked for the purposes of sexual exploitation, and children trafficked for online exploitation and child pornography. Janejinda opts to take a positive approach on where Thailand stands today on this issue saying that it has some of the best legal protection of any country within the Asean region. ""The Thai Anti-Trafficking Persons Act was written in 2008 and enacted in 2009, so it is only 10 years ago that Thailand's first anti-human trafficking police division was formed. ""Anti-trafficking is a sector in which governments across the globe are working to formulate effective strategies, and it's an area that requires incredible nuance in how you approach convictions, arrests and prosecutions. Therefore governments around the world are still developing the resources and the expertise necessary to combat this crime."" Sharing her personal concerns on the issue, Janejinda said that as a Thai citizen, she believes it's pivotal for Thai society not turn a blind eye to the issue of human trafficking in the country, saying that it's important for families, parents and schools to be educating children and vulnerable communities about the risks of human trafficking. Equally important is for everyone to make sure that we keep this issue at the forefront of public attention, so that as Thais we can together work to solve this issue. ""The first step to solving a problem is acknowledging it, and once we are educated about this issue, then we must all play our part in supporting efforts to end human trafficking in our home country. For some, that might mean donating funds to civil society groups that are providing support services to survivors. For others, it might mean raising awareness in your schools or places of work. For business owners, it means making sure there are fair and transparent business and labour practices within companies. We all have a role to play in tackling this issue,"" noted Janejinda. Prior to sharing their future goals, the head of aftercare said that one of the most encouraging achievements they had seen in past years was the strong, collaborative relationships that have developed between their team and local law enforcement, in terms of shared learning and partnership. ""Nvader's goal is to continue to strategically identify needs and fill these gaps. We are honoured to come alongside local law enforcement to mentor, train and build capacity. In 2018, we will be working to increase our legal support services to survivors, in order to strengthen access to justice for survivors, including representation in court and claims for compensation. Our aftercare team of social workers will be partnering with NGOs in the Mekong region to strengthen repatriation and reintegration efforts."" On changing their name to LIFT International, Janejinda said their new branding reflects their desire to ""lift survivors, lift justice, and lift standards"". ""It reflects the way we operate and as we look to the future we believe this name can help us to achieve our vision: Freedom for the exploited. Justice that protects. A world where human trafficking is not tolerated. We hope to achieve this vision through prosecuting and preventing human trafficking by strengthening justice systems. We aim to lift and raise the lives and hopes of survivors of exploitation and trafficking towards freedom."""

The sentence capped a remarkable seven-day hearing in which more than 150 of Larry Nassar's victims offered statements about the physician who was renowned for treating athletes at the sport's highest levels. Some confronted him face to face in the Michigan courtroom. ""It is my honour and privilege to sentence you. You do not deserve to walk outside a prison ever again. You have done nothing to control those urges and anywhere you walk, destruction will occur to those most vulnerable,"" Judge Rosemarie Aquilina said. Nassar's actions were ""precise, calculated, manipulative, devious, despicable,"" she said. When the hearing ended, the courtroom broke into applause. Victims and prosecutors embraced at the conclusion of the gruelling 16-month case. Before serving the Michigan sentence, the 54-year-old Nassar must first serve a 60-year federal sentence for child pornography crimes. With credits for good behaviour, he could complete that sentence in about 55 years. But by then, he would be more than 100 years old if still alive. He is scheduled to be sentenced next week on more assault convictions in Eaton County, Michigan. A prosecutor called Nassar ""possibly the most prolific serial child sex abuser in history"" and said he found competitive gymnastics to be a ""perfect place"" for his crimes because victims saw him as a ""god."" Prosecutor Angela Povilaitis also said Nassar ""perfected a built-in excuse and defence"" as a doctor, even though he was ""performing hocus-pocus medicine."" ""It takes some kind of sick perversion to not only assault a child but to do so with her parent in the room,"" Povilaitis said. ""To do so while a line-up of eager young gymnasts waited."" She urged people to believe young victims of sexual abuse no matter who they accuse. Although Nassar's work with gymnasts received the most attention, the allegations against him spanned a dozen sports over 25 years. Nassar turned to the courtroom gallery to make a brief statement, saying that the victims' accounts had ""shaken me to my core."" He said ""no words"" can describe how sorry he is for his crimes. ""I will carry your words with me for the rest of my days"" he said as many of his accusers wept. The judge then read from a letter that Nassar had written to her in which he complained about the sentence he had been given in the child-pornography case and defended his actions with the athletes as ""medical, not sexual."" ""I was a good doctor because my treatment worked, and those patients that are now speaking out were the same ones that praised and came back over and over, and referred family and friends to see me."" PREVIOUS REPORT LANSING, Michigan: One of the first athletes to accuse Larry Nassar of sexual assault confronted him Wednesday in a Michigan courtroom where the former sports doctor was due to the sentenced for years of molesting Olympic gymnasts and other young women. The last of more than 150 victims to offer statements at Nassar's sentencing hearing was a Kentucky lawyer who stepped forward in 2016 after USA Gymnastics was accused of mishandling complaints of sexual assault. Rachael Denhollander said Nassar groped, fondled and penetrated her with his hands when she was a 15-year-old gymnast in Michigan. Denhollander's statements to Michigan State University police put the criminal investigation in high gear in 2016. ""You have become a man ruled by selfish and perverted desires,"" she told Nassar, who worked at the university and USA Gymnastics, the sport's governing body, which also trains Olympians. Nassar faces a minimum prison term of 25 to 40 years when he is sentenced later Wednesday by Judge Rosemarie Aquilina. The sentence will cap a remarkable seven-day hearing that has given the girls, young women and their parents a chance to confront the doctor in court. Nassar, 54, pleaded guilty to assaulting seven people in the Lansing area, but the sentencing hearing has been open to anyone who said they were a victim. His accusers said he would use his ungloved hands to penetrate them, often without explanation, while they were on a table seeking help for various injuries. The accusers, many of whom were children, said they trusted Nassar to care for them properly, were in denial about what was happening or were afraid to speak up. He sometimes used a sheet or his body to block the view of any parent in the room. ""I'd been told during my entire gymnastics career to not question authority,"" a former elite gymnast, Isabell Hutchins, said Tuesday. The judge is likely to be unsparing in her treatment of Nassar. Aquilina has praised the victims who have appeared in her court since Jan. 16, calling them ""sister survivors,"" while also assuring them that their perpetrator will pay. The women have included Olympians Aly Raisman, Jordyn Wieber and McKayla Maroney. ""Your words are vital. They are as strong as your martial arts,"" Aquilina told Christina Barba, who has known Nassar for decades and practices karate. ""They will take him down quicker and cleaner than any kick you've got."" Hutchins and Mattie Larson, a former national gymnast, talked about how Nassar won their allegiance with candy, Olympic trinkets and encouraging words while they were under constant scrutiny from their demanding coaches. Brooke Hylek, a gymnast who plans to compete in college, heaped scorn on Nassar. ""I cannot believe I ever trusted you, and I will never forgive you,"" she said Tuesday. ""I'm happy you will be spending the rest of your life in prison. Enjoy hell by the way."" Emily Morales had a softer message. ""I want you to apologise to me right here,"" the 18-year-old told Nassar. ""I want to forgive you, but I also want to hear you tell me that you regret all the hurting you caused."" He did. She replied with, ""Thank you."" Nassar has already been sentenced to 60 years in federal prison for child pornography crimes. He is scheduled to be sentenced next week on more assault convictions in Eaton County, Michigan."

The imposter gained the boy's trust to the point that he got carried away and masturbated while on one of their live chats unaware he was being recorded. The ladyboy sold the clip of the boy on Twitter. Boon's school friends eventually got a hold of this clip and he became the laughingstock of the school.

Photo: YVONNE BOHWONGPRASERT It was at this juncture that Thailand Internet Crimes Against Children (TICAC) task force were notified. They contacted the US embassy in Thailand for help, and finally traced the Facebook and Twitter accounts to a ladyboy in Khon Kaen province. ""This is one among many criminal cases on the internet that TICAC has investigated through painstaking dedication, perseverance and team work, "" said Pol Col Thakoon Nimsomboon, head of operations team. ""Usually the victims are emotionally and physically in a bad shape when we reach them. As a father myself, it is disturbing to witness the trauma these children undergo. Someone has to get the work done, so we are determined to do all that is in our power to first rescue the child victim and than catch the perpetrators. Even though we have to sit through hours of footage of vile acts being done on children to determine the location or name of the victim."" Thakoon, who has a doctorate in criminal justice from a US-based university, said he hopes to increase awareness of child predators lurking online. Parents and teachers in particular have to be on alert, he said, because children today are computer savvy and mature earlier than previous generations. Alarmingly, while child and adult pornography is widely accessible on the internet, very little has been done globally to protect children from becoming victims, he said. Members of the task force. Photo courtesy of Thailand Internet Crimes Against Children [TICAC] He suggested data be kept on criminals and shared with the public when deemed necessary. Adding that while government-run agencies have began this process, it is still in its infancy stage. The public has the right to know if they are safe among their neighbours. To make his point, Thakoon shared a case where a young woman was raped and murdered by a man who lived next door to her. The case raised concerns at many levels, he said. ""Doesn't everyone have the right to know if they are safe where they live so they can take precautions. If I have a young daughter, it is my right to know as a father that the man who has rented the flat next to mine is not a paedophile. ""We can no longer brush this issue under the carpet by saying people who have served a jail sentence especially for heinous crimes have the right to not inform the public when they are released."" Another disturbing observation made by Thakoon was the young age of paedophiles he came to meet during his investigations, contrary to the popular belief that paedophiles are old men. The youngest he has come across was only 15. The Thai teenager had begun targeting toddlers years earlier. ""I was rather taken aback to see this young man tell me how he was sexually aroused by three-year-old children. Before meeting him, I had presumed paedophiles to be much older,"" he said. ""Some of the youngest victims are just a couple of months old."" Offenders come from all walks of life and nationalities. Some are from highly respected careers. Thakoon said the public and government have to work together to build a society where people have the right to reside in a safe environment. Pol Col Soonthorn Arunnara leads the TICAC team in the northeast. The law enforcement officer is credited for playing a pivotal role in amending the law stipulating penalties for the possession of child pornography. He said the most challenging aspect of his work with TICAC was to observe society's indifference towards children. He based this assumption on how criminal cases are prioritised. Raising the rape/murder of Nong Cartoon, the six-year-old who was murdered by a man who had previously killed 10 children, he said: ""This case, while making headline news, did little to stir up support to protect our children, in contradiction to drug-related cases where there is huge support. Criminal minds use these loopholes for their benefit. TICAC was set up in part to see that our children take first priority."" In terms of evidence, he said that when law enforcement work on crimes that are committed online, there is often not as such tangible evidence as they would see in a drug-related case, so it is plausible this could put people off showing a greater amount of interest in addressing crimes of a sexual nature involving children. Soonthorn said the attitude Thais have towards child pornography was also troubling. During the amending of the law stipulating penalties for the possession of child pornography, he said he received a barrage of criticism from the public for his stance. ""By and large the attitude was 'what's the big deal', this really made it all the more necessary for me to see it become law,"" Soonthorn said. ""Thai society still views the situation of watching child pornography in a light-hearted manner. They feel it is OK to watch because they are not physically touching the child."" To address the issue of cyber crime against children, both officers suggest parents and teachers work closely to offer mentors for different age groups, so when an issue arises, children are able to be counselled by a reliable person. Instead of totally depending on police to keep them safe, they should form neighbourhood watch groups. As parents themselves, both felt it was up to fathers and mothers to foster better ties with their children, saying: ""Parents have to teach children about the birds and the bees before they learn it from people with ill intentions. Keep a close tab on the websites kids are on today. If you build trust with your child, there is little to worry."" - TICAC task force, set up on Jan 8, 2016, is supported by the FBI and the US Department of Homeland Security, and designed to share intelligence. - There are currently 135 officers, 114 men and 21 women, working around the clock. - Utilising a US model, TICAC combats sexual exploitation facilitated via the internet. For instance, Thai law enforcement officials just started working directly with the US National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children to share real-time information about victims and offenders. - Once victims are detected, the next step is providing them with assistance, standard practice for the FBI. - For TICAC, victim assistance is not just the morally correct course of action, it provides information that helps police more effectively investigate lawbreakers.

The head of the panchayat (local council) in Bichhor, a village 90 kilometres south of Delhi, he has been busy defusing communal tension triggered by offensive social media posts by both Hindu and Muslim young people. Early last month, a young Hindu shared a post on Facebook abusing the prophet Mohammed. Mr Jaildar called a meeting of elders and forced the youth to apologise. Social friction was avoided, but not for long. Shortly afterward, two other Hindu youths -- Rupesh Sharma and Krishan Kumar Agrawal -- shared on Facebook posts critical of the prophet, provoking Muslims to stage a sit-in outside the Bichhor police station. ""On Oct 6, a police officer told me 3,000 people were sitting on a road outside the police station. They had blocked traffic. I pleaded with them to remove the blockade and let the police do their work,"" Mr Jaildar told Asia Focus. The trouble didn't end there. The anti-Muslim posts were followed by a message sent by a local Muslim youth, Saddiq Pathan, against the Hindu god Ram and goddess Durga. The Bichhor police registered cases against the three young men under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and arrested them on Oct 8. They are now free on bail pending trial. Bichhor is not the only community to have experienced this growing form of online antagonism. In July and August, Naseem Khan, head of the panchayat in Nagina, a town 30 kilometres away, tackled similar problems. Mr Khan had to convene two panchayats to cool passions that had flared over offensive posts by a Hindu and a Muslim. The former, Daulatram, was beaten with a shoe, ousted from Nagina for three months and ordered to pay 11,000 rupees (5,600 baht) as a fine. The Muslim youth was cleared after he proved that he had been tagged in the offensive post against his wishes. Offensive Facebook and WhatsApp messages have been proliferating in a country where fierce competition among mobile operators has resulted in rock-bottom pricing. Reliance Jio, one of the country's biggest operators, got the ball rolling when it started providing free 4G internet data and voice calls last year. The company, owned by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, now provides one gigabyte of data per day at a very nominal price. ""[Policing offensive posts] is the only work left for us since Jio entered the market. Now all illiterate and unemployed people in Mewat have smartphones and Jio connections and they are committing this stupidity,"" Mr Khan told Asia Focus in a telephone interview. Mewat is considered the most backward district in Haryana state, with a literacy rate of about 30% compared with the national average of 67%. Unemployment is also very high with only a small percentage of adults employed in agriculture, cattle rearing and driving taxis, police, the army and the private sector. While a family of two children is considered the norm in most of Harayana, families with five or six children are considered small in Mewat. Poverty is widespread and the practice of ""buying"" brides from even poorer regions of India persists. Unlike other parts of Haryana where villages have most basic amenities -- concrete roads, drinking water, proper drainage and connectivity -- villages in Mewat still have muddy and filthy streets and uncemented houses. A panchayat of village elders gather in Bichhor. Local leaders have had to step in to admonish young people for bad online behaviour. Photos: Narendra Kaushik ""In my village, only about 100 youths are in the police and army and about 200 are working in the private sector. The rest are unemployed,"" said Mr Jaildar. Bichhor is home to about 10,000 adults of voting age. About 1,700 are Hindus and the rest are Muslims. One thing the community has in profusion, though, is mobile phone shops -- at least half a dozen have opened in the last year. Most young people now have smartphones and Jio accounts. This gives them unbridled access to movies, music, videos and even pornography. Muslims in Bichhor largely blame the offensive posts against the prophet on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which runs both the central and state government and is aligned with Hindu nationalist groups, some of them quite unsavoury. ""The BJP has no issues to fight an election on. It wants to divide people on religious lines,"" said Moulvi Shabbir Ahmed, the imam of a mosque in Bichhor. Deen Mohammad, a brick kiln owner and two dozen others gathered with the imam nodded their heads in agreement. Mr Jaildar, who campaigned for the BJP during the last state legislature elections, denies the claim. In fact, some Hindu families see a sinister design behind the offensive posts. Among them is the brother of Krishan Kumar Agarwal, one of those now facing police charges. ""It is a conspiracy to drive us out of the village because we are in the minority. The offensive post was sitting on my brother's Facebook page since 2015. Now they have filed the case,"" said Yogesh Agrawal. There are others who attribute the increased intolerance among Muslims to radicalisation. ""They have become more sensitive toward their religious symbols in recent years,"" said Bichhor resident Sachin Jain, who teaches information technology in a private school in nearby Faridabad. Mewat is home to a large population of Meos, a tribe that converted to Islam between the 15th and 17th centuries, though they still follow many Hindu rituals. In fact, many of them consider themselves descendants of the Hindu gods Ram and Krishna. Apart from Mewat, the Meos are also settled in parts of Alwar and Bharatpur, two districts of Rajasthan state. Overall, social media has widened the divisions in the Indian society. In July this year, widespread violence was reported in Basirhat in West Bengal state over a Facebook post against the prophet by a Hindu high-school student. Around the same time, an adolescent Muslim boy was beaten up in Pauri Garhwal district in Uttarakhand state over an offensive post against the Kedarnath shrine, a Hindu site dedicated to Lord Shiva. Last month, another Muslim youth was arrested in Hamirpur in Uttar Pradesh state for hacking into the account of a district coordinator of a BJP student wing and putting up posts mocking Hindu gods and goddesses. He was also accused of making obscene comments against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Uttar Pradesh state Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath."

Nine were Thai nationals and four were Americans. Among the recorded cases were six involving possession of child pornography, four child trafficking cases, two sexual offence cases and one deportation case. The joint effort was implemented as part of the FBI's annual transnational initiative to recover underage victims of prostitution and raise awareness of child sex trafficking, said FBI legal attache in Thailand John M Schachnovsky. Called ""Operation Cross-Country XI (OCC),"" the effort was held for a second successive year in Thailand from Sep 7 to Oct 14. The OCC has been in operation for 11 years in several countries including Canada, the United Kingdom, Cambodia and the Philippines. According to Mr Schachnovsky, foreign institutions can obtain valuable data that would otherwise not be accessible to local authorities. ""Every year the Thai police's capacity for investigation into these issues gets better,"" he said. ""While it is an unfortunate number to see, we are pleased with the number of arrests."" He added 10 children have so far been rescued from sex abusers in Thailand under the OCC. Domestic groundwork for the initiative was mostly conducted by the RTP, under the Thailand Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force (Ticac). Since it was set up in December 2015, Ticac has made 58 arrests in the country, with Thais, Americans, British and Australians among the offenders. Weerawan Mosby, an adviser for Ticac and winner of this year's Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report award for Acting to End Modern Slavery, said the OCC is a step in the right direction for future investigations into child sexual exploitation cases. ""We are starting to see changes in terms of the way police and society at large view such cases. Police are starting to adopt a more child-centralised approach when investigating, reflecting increased concern among the public,"" she said."

Although Thailand has not advanced to issuing such a law, a task force working in this area has gained more confidence as it steps up efforts to crack down on sexual abuse against children. Tamasak Wicharaya, head of Thailand Internet Crimes Against Children (TICAC) led by the Royal Thai Police, said the agency is taking on a bigger workload and receiving more cooperation from related bodies. The agency worked on 24 cases last year and 32 cases as of Oct 31 this year, compared with two cases related to internet crimes against children. The probes have resulted from cases tip-offs for 183 incidents, including 124 which came from abroad. At least 57 suspects have been identified, said Pol Gen Tamasak, who is also an acting deputy commissioner-general of the Royal Thai Police. Not all tip-offs could be developed into legal cases. However, all cases taken to court by the TICAC have succeeded so far. All the suspects identified were convicted, he said. TICAC was opened on Jan 8, 2016 to investigate crimes against children on the internet. Its scope of work includes child sexual abuse, human trafficking and possession of child pornography. On Dec 8, 2015, Thailand amended the Criminal Law stipulating penalties for the possession of child pornography as well as transferring or disseminating such material. ""Some media can arouse the demand for child sex abuse,"" he said, adding that preventive measures are also important. ""We also try to stop child sexual abuse even before it happens. Otherwise, the impact over the victim's life can be huge."" Social media and internet use in Thailand has been monitored. If porn media is uploaded or downloaded, the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), based in the US, will be notified, with TICAC will also getting such notifications when the content is opened in Thailand. The NCMEC reached an agreement with the TICAC to share the information. Other agencies such as the FBI and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) as well as the embassies of foreign countries also receive such alerts. Digital forensic experts, digital intelligence analysts and psychologists are on the task force, which also collaborates with NGOs such as Hope, Understanding and Grace (HUG) project in Chiang Mai which opened the ACT (Advocacy Centre For Children Thailand) House, the first such centre in Southeast Asia, which also has branches in Pattaya and Phuket. Thakoon Nimsomboon, head of TICAC operations, said the centre had gained trust from collaborating international and domestic organisations as it observes international standards in the field. ""We do not work just to get a conviction. We consult NGOs and experts to make sure we do no harm to victims, who are children. That's why we do not contact the media during the operations. We care how a child will fare if his father, for example, is arrested,"" said Pol Col Thakoon. Both Pol Gen Tamasak and Pol Col Thakoon said it is important to raise awareness among parents and caretakers of children that the risks of child sexual abuse are high and exist around them in their daily life. The TICAC receives at least 5,000 tip-offs each month from the NCMEC alone, said Pol Col Thakoon. ""Although we don't want to reveal much of what we are doing, we warned the locals to watch out, for example, if there a Caucasian is trying to contact children via the internet or might drop in to see their kids at school,"" he said. TICAC hotline number is 1599. With the support of Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwon, the TICAC received an annual budget of 8.6 million baht over the past two years, with TICAC staff increasing from 80 last year to 130 this year."

The two-day retreat in Monterey, California, where employees from the $682 billion company plied Washington policy experts with questions about the pros and cons of its size, took place as Google confronts European antitrust claims and proposed U.S. legislation that would increase online publishers' liability for content produced by others. This week, the Alphabet Inc. unit disclosed new information that could further roil the regulatory picture: revelations that Russian-linked accounts used its advertising network to interfere with the 2016 presidential election. The news put Google in the company of Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc., both of which are embroiled in the controversy surrounding Russia's involvement in last year's U.S. elections. Executives at all three companies are scrambling to respond. Facebook has hired two crisis PR firms, and it plans to bring on as many as 1,000 people to screen ads. Top executives, including Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg, are phoning members of Congress directly. The company reported spending more than $3.2 million on lobbying in the first quarter of 2017, a company record. Google spent almost $6 million in the second quarter for its own record. Both companies, with Twitter, are working together to deal with issues related to the Russian ads. Google, Facebook, and Twitter scramble to hold Washington at bay https://t.co/QiiQrE66eW pic.twitter.com/zLoCJDU1RY 

 (Twitter/@business) ""There is a lot of pressure to intervene in this case because of the democratic implications,"" said Laura DeNardis, director of the Internet Governance Lab at American University in Washington. ""Because of the rising stakes for cyberspace, for the economy, for democracy, there is greater attention on the part of all actors."" It's a delicate balance for the companies, whose products reached massive scale because of their ability to transact advertising automatically, without much restriction. They must figure out how much responsibility to take and how much change to promise, without succumbing to costly regulation or setting a precedent that might be difficult to follow in other countries. In the context of political advertising, some lawmakers are already proposing new limits. ""We must update our laws to ensure that when political ads are sold online Americans know who paid for them,"" Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat, said Monday. Two congressional committees and special counsel Robert Mueller are examining whether Russian operatives used social-media platforms to influence U.S. voters in 2016. Investigators are also examining possible collusion between Russian interests and associates of President Donald Trump. Facebook has turned over more than 3,000 ads purchased by Russian entities to both congressional investigations. Twitter has said it gave the panels a round-up of advertisements by RT, a TV network funded by the Russian government that was formerly known as Russia Today. Facebook for years has sought exemptions from political-ad disclosure rules -- but the company recently said it's working on ways to show who pays for ads. It also indicated it might be open to some regulation regarding transparency. For Google, the new concerns around political advertising come as it responds to European antitrust charges and tries to preserve online platforms' liability protections under a law known as Section 230. A Senate bill aimed at stopping online sex trafficking has drawn opposition from Google, Facebook and other internet companies because it weakens those protections. Google executives expected Congress to be more receptive to its arguments that penalizing knowledge of trafficking might stop smaller internet companies from looking for it at all. They were caught off-guard by negative responses to the company's lobbying, according to one Washington operative who works for the company. Meanwhile, a potential showdown on political advertising looms on Nov. 1, when executives from Google, Facebook and Twitter have been summoned to Washington to give public testimony before congressional committees. Facebook's two top executives -- Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg -- have joined others in making calls to members of Congress and trying to smooth relationships, the company said. It has also hired two crisis communications firms to help it on both Republican and Democratic fronts. And a letter went out to advertisers, saying Facebook staff would manually review ads that target people based on their politics, religion, ethnicity or social issues. Facebook's vice president of public policy, Elliot Schrage, started a question-and-answer-style blog called ""Hard Questions"" in June. In consultation with Liz Spayd, the former New York Times public editor, Facebook updates the blog when news breaks on the company's relationship with the Trump campaign and the Russian ads. On Sunday, when ""60 Minutes"" aired an interview with the Trump campaign's digital director saying he had partisan Facebook employees work as ""embeds"" in the campaign, the company added an explanation of how its services for Trump were standard for any advertiser during an important event. The strategy is meant to reassure the public, and lawmakers, that Facebook is working diligently on solutions and therefore doesn't need to be regulated more. But some critics say that by volunteering to be responsible, Facebook is opening itself up to more publicity and more blame. Inside the company, leaders are dismayed by how the public is interpreting its involvement in the Russia investigation, according to a person familiar with their thinking. Executives fear that Facebook's work for the presidential campaigns is being re-framed as partisan, for example, even though it offers the same services to any major advertiser. Alex Stamos, Facebook's chief security officer, defended the company from media critics who say it should have found a technical solution to the problem of fake news. It's not that simple -- and any quick solution could end up being ideologically biased, he said in a series of recent posts on Twitter. Facebook, Twitter and Google are cooperating on issues related to the Russian political ads. A person familiar with the effort said it was similar to how the three firms would work together on difficult industry-wide issues, such as child pornography or content from terrorist groups. ""We are taking a deeper look to investigate attempts to abuse our systems, working with researchers and other companies, and will provide assistance to ongoing inquiries,"" a Google spokeswoman said on Monday. Twitter executives have been in frequent contact with Congressional committees and investigators to try and answer their questions before Nov. 1, according to a person familiar with the matter. The company is addressing the issue from multiple angles, the person said, including asking engineers to examine spam-use on the platform and asking its advertising team to delve into ad purchases by RT, the Russian TV network. Teaching Twitter's algorithms to find malicious actors is challenging; Russian actors in particular are moving away from bots and networks to human beings that behave in coordinated ways, the person said. For instance, it can be difficult for Twitter's algorithms to detect the difference between a group of paid tweets in Eastern Europe and a group of legitimate tweeters who are all posting at the same time at a convention. Bloomberg LP is developing a global breaking news network for the Twitter service. Meanwhile, Google took a more creative approach to discussing its future last month. At the policy session in Monterey, one speaker played the opposition, voicing concerns about the power big corporations can wield over society. Another played defence. That was Robert Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. His upcoming book, Big is Beautiful -- co-authored by Michael Lind -- argues larger firms create progress and prosperity. ""It was very open-minded to have that kind of debate,"" Atkinson said when reached by phone. ""The threats against Google are certainly more severe now. Trying to portray yourself just as a good company is not adequate enough."""

											Lawsuit challenges US border searches of computers, phones										",https://search.bangkokpost.com/track/visitAndRedirect?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bangkokpost.com%2Fworld%2F1323655%2Flawsuit-challenges-us-border-searches-of-computers-phones&contentId=news1323655,"WASHINGTON: A federal lawsuit filed Wednesday claims the US government's growing practice of searching laptops and cellphones at the border is unconstitutional because electronic devices now carry troves of private personal and business information. The government has vociferously defended its searches as critical to protecting the homeland. The Fourth Amendment of the Constitution prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures, and requires law enforcement to secure warrants based on probable cause. Courts, however, have made an exception for searches at US ports of entry and airports. They've ruled the government can do warrantless border searches to enforce immigration and customs laws and protect national security. In today's digital world, these searches should not be conducted without a warrant, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the American Civil Liberties Union argue. Top officials at the Department of Homeland Security and two of its units - Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement - are named in the suit. ""People now store their whole lives, including extremely sensitive personal and business matters, on their phones, tablets and laptops and it's reasonable for them to carry these with them when they travel,"" said foundation attorney Sophia Cope. ""It's high time that the courts require the government to stop treating the border as a place where they can end-run the Constitution."" The foundation and ACLU filed their suit in US District Court in Massachusetts on behalf of 10 American citizens and a lawful permanent resident from seven states. The plaintiffs include an artist, two journalists, a limousine driver, two students, a filmmaker, a college professor, a business owner, a computer programmer and an engineer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. All had their electronic devices searched by border agents when they returned from trips abroad, the suit said. None had ever been accused of any wrongdoing. Border officials confiscated several plaintiffs' devices and kept them for weeks or months. One plaintiff's security device, confiscated in January, is still in government custody. Matthew Wright, a 38-year-old computer programmer in Colorado, said his phone, laptop and camera were confiscated at the Denver airport on April 21, 2016, as he returned from Southeast Asia where he participated in four Frisbee tournaments. Border agents asked him to unlock his laptop. ""They said 'If you refuse to unlock it, we're going to confiscate it,'"" he told The Associated Press in a phone interview. ""I said 'Well, I don't want that to happen, but I'm not going to unlock it.' And so they confiscated the laptop and then they confiscated my other electronics - my smartphone and my camera."" When he left the airport, Wright went straight to an Apple store and spent $2,420 for a new laptop and phone, which he needed for work. Fifty-six days after being confiscated, they were mailed back to him. DHS has not yet commented on the suit. But the government has previously emphasized that such searches are exceedingly rare. From last October to the end of March, they affected fewer than one-hundredth of 1 percent of the 189.6 million international travelers who arrived in the United States. Searches, however, are becoming more frequent. In the 2015 fiscal year, Customs and Border Protection searched the electronic devices of 8,503 international travelers. The number rose to 19,033 the next year. In the first half of the current fiscal year, there were 14,993 searches. ""The government cannot use the border as a dragnet to search through our private data,"" ACLU attorney Esha Bhandari said. DHS officials have asserted that US citizens and everyone else are subject to examination and search by customs officials, unless exempted by diplomatic status. The department says no court has concluded that border searches of electronic devices require a warrant. Searches, some random, have uncovered evidence of human trafficking, terrorism, child pornography, visa fraud, export controls breaches and intellectual property rights violations, according to the department. One plaintiff, Akram Shibly, was ordered to surrender his phone on Jan. 1 as he re-entered the United States after a social outing in Toronto. Shibly, an independent filmmaker from Buffalo, New York, refused to give it up, partly because customs agents had just searched it three days earlier when he returned from a work trip in Toronto. According to the suit, one officer squeezed his hand around Shilby's throat. Another retrained Shibly's legs. And a third officer pulled the phone from Shibly's pocket. The phone, still unlocked because Shilby had never restored the lock screen he had disengaged during the first search, was taken to a separate room and searched. Another plaintiff, Diane Maye, 38, of Orange City, Florida, was stopped on June 25 when she returned at the Miami airport from her vacation in Norway. A border agent led her to a back room where she was instructed to unlock her phone and computer. She complied, but still doesn't know why she was stopped. One officer kept the phone for 90 minutes to two hours. Another questioned her for a couple of hours about her travels, academic life and career. From June 2008 to November 2009, Maye worked in Iraq managing a defense contract that provided bilingual and cultural advisers to Defense and State department employees involved in reconstruction efforts. They asked her if she knew any Iraqis. ""I know literally thousands of Iraqis,"" Maye told the AP in a phone interview. Maye, who also wrote a doctoral dissertation on Iraqi politics, is now an assistant professor of homeland security at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. She has worked in the defense industry and was a former Air Force captain. ""I use my phone for my work. I use my phone for my emails. I have banking information, text messages, photographs,"" said Maye, who was released with her computer and cellphone in hand. ""While I don't have anything that I care that people know about, I just didn't want my privacy in the hands of a security officer. It kinda started to disgust me."""

A student of comparative literature at Sorbonne, the Japanese man two days earlier had killed his Dutch classmate, raped her corpse, stored her body in his fridge and ate morsels after morsels of her flesh to stimulate his sexual desire. Only when the smell became unbearable did he pack what remained in the suitcases and threw them into the river. The French court declared Sagawa legally insane and released him. He returned to Japan, wrote a comic book about his world-famous case, became a food critic (no kidding), and starred in pornographic films. Today Sagawa, old and paralytic, still lives in a suburb of Tokyo. Scenes from Caniba. photos courtesy of TORONTO INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL In Caniba, showing this week at Toronto International Film Festival, the documentary filmmakers Verena Paravel and Lucien Castaing-Taylor captures Sagawa on the camera, almost in extreme close-up throughout 90 minutes, a work of powerful, disturbing intensity that blurs the line between film and video art, between confession and reminiscence, and between representation and porn. Paravel and Castaing-Taylor were in Japan to work on a project about Fukushima when a Japanese scholar told them about the ""pink film"", or soft-core pornography, that starred Sagawa in the lead. As a child in Paris, Paravel remembered the case. ""He was like a figure of my childhood,"" the filmmaker said after the screening in Toronto, and so instead of Fukushima they set out to make the film about the infamous cannibal. What sets Caniba apart from other films about cannibalism is that the filmmakers are less interested in the act of flesh-eating or the sensational perversity of it. Paravel and Castaing-Taylor said they wanted to ""collaborate with Sagawa"" rather than impose themselves upon him and his story: the result is a patient, disquieting study of the man's cannibalistic desire and the deep, perhaps unfathomable impulse that connects sexual urge with flesh eating -- the total consumption of another person whom you feel strongly attracted to. In return, Sagawa also expresses his wish to be eaten to death by another cannibal. There's more twist to the film. In Caniba, we see only two men, almost always in claustrophobic close-up shot where we only see sections of their faces and never the whole thing. Issei Sagawa has a brother, Jun Sagawa, who appears to be taking care of his notorious sibling. Midway through, Jun reveals the secret of his own violent fetish to the filmmakers and the film about cannibalism turns out to be a film about a bizarre sibling rivalry: who's more shocking, more perverse. Before the screening, Paravel warned the viewers that they should close their eyes at certain points in the film -- and those points aren't even about cannibalism. Paravel and Castaing-Taylor are the leading figures in the Sensory Ethnography Lab (SEL), founded at Harvard University, a well-respected experimental laboratory whose approach to documentary film-making -- or visual art making -- is about finding total experience and audience immersion, to, in its own words, ""explore the aesthetics and ontology of the natural and unnatural world"". Usually without narration, voice over, and with little context to the situation being portrayed, the films from SEL put you in the environment and let things happen -- the best-known film from the lab, also directed by Paravel and Castaing-Taylor, is Leviathan, a monumental example of life experience as captured by digital cameras mounted at various places on a fishing boat as it ventures out at sea. The highly stylised visual of Caniba allows it to watch its subject, Issei Sagawa, a man associated with monstrosity and immoral perversion, so closely, so intimately, so frighteningly, and yet because of this surreal proximity, there's no distance between us and him -- and without distance, there's no judgement. Sagawa was declared insane. He's now ill, and his speech is slow and erratic, but clearly his mind is still working, and the memory of his horrid crime hasn't faded from his brain. One of the hardest films to watch this year, Caniba is also an intense and strangely engaging experience where art, life, horror and film intersect and move as one."

After a months-long battle between the mother and father for custody of their children, a court order forced the French father to hand over his kids to their Chinese mother on Thursday. While the children were happy to see their mother when they met at a city police station, they refused to go home with her. It is not known how long the brother and sister will have to stay away from their parents, Tatpol Chuenchonpruk, the father's lawyer said. He told the Bangkok Post the situation was now out of hand, and it was clear the children could not go back with either parent. ""The best they can do at this point is let the kids decide who they want to be with,"" Mr Tatpol said. Over the past few years, the children's father, Cedric Servan, and their mother took turns every week to keep the kids. However, in April, Mr Servan used the public holidays on Chakri Day and the Songkran period as an excuse to skip their appointment and kept the children with him longer, while the mother went to receive them at the court in vain. In May, the children told Mr Servan that their mother's lover played pornography in front of them and molested them. He then filed a complaint with Chon Buri police. A physical examination of the children found nothing wrong, but the psychological test did, according to Mr Servan, who was reluctant to hand the children over to their mother. The mother refused to speak to the media. Meanwhile, the first court hearing on the alleged molestation case has been set for Oct 30. Legally, the mother now has sole custody of the children, which was previously shared by both parents. After Mr Servan missed several appointments this year to allow the children to spend time with their mother, the court ordered the mother should have temporary custody until a new court order, said Mr Tatpol, who took over the alleged molestation case towards the end of June. ""Luckily, the officers from the Centre for the Protection of Children's Rights Foundation and the Department of Children and Youth were there to witness the incident [where the children refused to go with the mother]. They used their authority to take the two children under their care and they refused both parents custody of their children,"" he added. The children are now being kept at Chulalongkorn Hospital for psychological assessment for seven days. After that, both parents will have to go for the same assessment. The results will be sent to the Juvenile and Family Court to reconsider the order. The results of the psychological assessment and the court hearing in the alleged molestation case will be considered to determine a new custody order of the children. But for now, they will remain at the hospital under the protection of Thai officials, he said. Mr Servan said: ""It was sad and heartbreaking to see how my kids are suffering. Their mother pulled and yanked my children while they were screaming and crying. I just stood there, unable to help since I [previously] disobeyed the court order."" Orapin Sak-eiam, director of the Children's Welfare Protection Division of the Department of Children and Youth, Ministry of Social Development and Human Security, revealed a multi-disciplinary team has now submitted a request to the court for temporary custody of the children. They are now in the psychological assessment process, which will take seven days. ""We have to consider the children's welfare first. They must have a healthy and stable state of mind before returning to their family. If the two parents can't settle this, the children will be sent to stay at a government children's home,"" Ms Orapin said."

											Indonesia gets tough on social media monitoring										",https://search.bangkokpost.com/track/visitAndRedirect?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bangkokpost.com%2Fbusiness%2F1305767%2Findonesia-gets-tough-on-social-media-monitoring&contentId=news1305767,"After blocking Telegram since July 14, the Indonesian government has lifted its ban on the encrypted messaging service that has become popular as a platform for radicals and terrorists to communicate and propagate their ideas. The Ministry of Communication and Information Technology (MCIT) last Thursday unblocked Telegram's 11 domain names after the latter took down 166 channels containing information related to terrorism and radicalism, which the ministry and other agencies had reported to the company. The move followed a meeting between minister Rudiantara and Telegram CEO Pavel Durov in Jakarta on Aug 1, during which Mr Durov apologised for not responding in a more timely manner to the ministry's repeated emails requesting action. Mr Durov said Telegram was committed to blocking public channels that could be used for the propagation of terrorism globally, and particularly in Indonesia. ""We have discussed ways to make it more efficient,"" he said during a joint news conference with Mr Rudiantara. Commuters use their smartphones while waiting for a train at the Tanah Abang station in Jakarta. Photo: Reuters The meeting with Mr Durov was part of a series of meetings that the minister has had this month with other social media, content and video sharing and messaging services as part of a crackdown on ""negative content"" online. The ministry had identified at least 55 Telegram channels that had terrorism-related content and according to police data, the majority of those convicted of terrorism-related activities between 2015 and July 2017 used the application to communicate. Khairul Fahmi, a researcher from the Jakarta-based Institute for Security and Strategic Studies (ISESS), said the new breed of messaging services and devices had been a boon for terrorists seeking to communicate with cells in Southeast Asia, notably Indonesia, the southern Philippines, southern Thailand and Malaysia. ""Fundraising, recruitment and directions for action have become swifter but more obscure,"" Mr Khairul told Asia Focus. Ade Bhakti, executive director of the Jakarta-based Centre for Radicalism and Deradicalisation Studies, said the use of online platforms by terrorists was hardly a new thing. Imam Samudra, who was executed in 2008 for carrying out the 2002 Bali bombings, used to communicate with his international network using an internet relay chat available on Windows, he said. In addition to using messaging services, terrorists also hack commercial and business sites to steal money to finance their activities, he said. ""Bahrumsyah and Abu Jandal even shared their clips which contained speeches calling on their followers to join terrorist groups on YouTube,"" Mr Ade said, referring to two Indonesian nationals who went to Syria to join the Islamic State (IS). Abu Jandal is believed to have died in combat. ""Participants in a 2010 paramilitary training exercise in Aceh also posted clips of their training on YouTube."" Google, which owns YouTube, says there should not be any content that promotes hate speech on the world's biggest video-sharing site. ""But there's so much content uploaded everyday to YouTube in many different languages so we really rely on our communities and users to flag it,"" said Ann Lavin, Google's policy and government affairs director for Greater China and Southeast Asia. She made the comment at a news conference on Aug 4 with Mr Rudiantara, who met Twitter representatives separately on the same day. To identify disturbing content on YouTube, Google will introduce the ""trusted flagger"" programme in Indonesia in the next two or three months, said Ms Lavin. A similar programme has been introduced in France, the United States, Germany and Britain but Indonesia will be the first country in Southeast Asia to have it. Content identified by flaggers, who believe it does not meet YouTube's community guidelines, would have priority to be reviewed by Google before a decision is made to take it down or not. Ms Lavin said the process of reviewing and removing flagged content would be transparent and documented in Google's semi-annual transparency reports that list the number of requests for certain categories and content that is removed. ""The amount and the nature of requests will be absolutely transparent to the public,"" she said. Google, she added, was also cooperating with three civil society organisations as trusted flaggers to moderate clips and content on YouTube: The Wahid Institute which is led by former president Abdurrahman Wahid's daughter, Yenny Wahid; the safe internet advocacy group ICT Watch, and the Anti-Defamation Society of Indonesia (Mafindo). Mr Rudiantara also met Jeff Wu, Facebook's Asia Pacific representative, on Aug 2. According to the ministry's director-general for information applications, Semuel A Pangerapan, Facebook agreed to install ""geoblocking"", which will allow users to control and monitor negative content in accordance with local culture and contexts. ""The geoblocking will have a special algorithm for Indonesian users and any flagged video cannot be accessed in Indonesia,"" Mr Semuel said. He said that in the past two years the ministry had received 402 reports of negative content of varying nature, from terrorism to child pornography and hate speech. But Facebook responded to only half of those complaints because of differences in perception as to what constitutes negative content, he said. The ministry urged Facebook to be more proactive about dealing with content deemed harmful to Indonesia when it receives information from a team comprising people who understand Indonesian values. Frenavit Putra, the coordinator for the ICT Watch trusted flaggers, said their task would be to help supplement the work of the Google's algorithm in content moderation. ""Everyone can be a flagger, but the content they flag would have to wait in a queue before being reviewed, whereas the content that we flag would get priority to be moderated. Google will decide to keep it or to take it down,"" he told Asia Focus. ""When we flag content, we have to provide a detailed analysis and reviews, down to which minutes and which seconds the disturbing content occurs at. We have to give justifications for our analysis and what we flag isn't just the content on clips but also the comments,"" he said. He said the group was not just providing input on content but also on context, and would be prepared to explain why a certain shot or comment on a clip uploaded to YouTube may have different meanings to different audiences. For example, views on what constitutes pornography differ from one country to another. In some countries, some forms of nudity alone would not be considered offensive but in others they would be. ""Google's algorithm cannot analyse that far,"" he said. ICT Watch is in charge of monitoring content related to hate speech, child protection, age restrictions on certain content or pornography. The Wahid Institute will deal with content related to terrorism or radicalism, and Mafindo deals with content related to hoaxes or fake news. ""We are including civil society organisations to ensure that this is not a censorship regime but we really have to protect Indonesia from negative content, particularly radicalism, terrorism and drugs. They would be the priority for us,"" Mr Rudiantara said."

											Malaysian accused of 600 sex assaults against daughter										",https://search.bangkokpost.com/track/visitAndRedirect?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bangkokpost.com%2Fworld%2F1303819%2Fmalaysian-accused-of-600-sex-assaults-against-daughter&contentId=news1303819,"KUALA LUMPUR - A Malaysian man was charged on Thursday with more than 600 counts of raping and sodomising his teenaged daughter, prompting calls for greater protection for women and girls. The case comes as Malaysia seeks to crack down on child sex offences, including the establishment of a special court for abuse cases, and tougher sentencing for child pornography and grooming. Reuters reported last year that most complaints of child sexual abuse in Malaysia do not lead to successful prosecutions, largely due to weaknesses in the criminal justice system. The 36-year-old man was charged with 626 counts of sodomy, rape, incest and other sexual abuses against his daughter, now 15. The crimes happened over two years after the girl's parents divorced in 2015, prosecutor Aimi Syazwani Sarmin told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. The man pleaded not guilty to the crimes before the hearing was adjourned, pending a trial. Local media said the girl only revealed the ordeal to her mother after she learnt her father planned to take her two younger sisters away from the mother to live with him. The mother lodged a police report in July, which led to the arrest. The case was then heard in the new court, which aims to speed cases through the system and better protect children. Campaigners say the case highlights the need to ensure cases of sexual assaults against minors be dealt with seriously to deter others, and for stronger measures to support survivors. ""The perpetrator must be brought to justice,"" Tan Heang Lee from the Women's Aid Organisation told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. ""What we need to ensure is that the child is given adequate emotional support to prevent further trauma during (the) court trial process."" Campaigners say 10 women are on average raped in the country each day, and more than half of them are under 16, according to a US State Department 2016 report. The report also cited official data showing that out of the 28,741 rape cases reported from 2005 to 2014, less than 3% ended with a guilty verdict in court. It cited cultural attitudes in mostly Moslem Malaysia and a lack of sympathy from the male-dominant police force as factors that discourage women from reporting the crime. The man was first brought to the court on Wednesday but the proceeding was delayed after prosecutors spent hours counting the mountain of documents detailing his charges."

Toshihiro Ota, 30, was indicted on a charge of forcibly committing indecent acts on two girls at an elementary school in Chita, Aichi, around May, while Koji Uda, a 37-year-old teacher at an elementary school in Nagoya, persuaded two young girls to send him nude photos. Mr Ota had been arrested in 2013 for allegedly sending child pornography online while working at an elementary school in Saitama Prefecture, but later managed to be hired by the Chita board of education after changing his legal name in the family registry. In addition to the indecent acts against the two girls, allegedly committed inside a school bathroom, he was served a fresh arrest warrant on Monday for a suspected indecent act against another. He had been working at the school as a temporary teacher before he was fired on Tuesday. Mr Uda, meanwhile, convinced a female junior high school student in Hokkaido and another in Nagasaki Prefecture to send indecent photos of themselves between October and November after becoming acquainted with them through a smartphone game. Mr Uda was arrested in June and was later ordered by a court to pay 300,000 yen (90,249 baht) in fines. The Nagoya board of education on Tuesday suspended him from work for six months, and he quit immediately."

He was utterly embarrassed but decided to tell police that a video clip of him masturbating had been distributed online and he wanted it removed. It transpired that he had fallen in love with a beautiful woman he met on the internet. They developed their relationship through video live chat, he got carried away and pleasured himself without knowing he was being recorded. He later found he was the victim of a group of transvestites who stole other people's pictures and created fake identities to lure young men like him in order to blackmail them. An investigation by the Thailand Internet Crimes Against Children (TICAC) Task Force found over 100 such video clips and dozens of victims. The task force is expanding its investigation into this case, which happened in a northeastern province. The number of teenage victims is expected to reach 200. At the same time, in another northeastern province, a similar case is being investigated in which an internet user with the identity of a handsome Thai-Singaporean luk krung seduces women he meets online, claiming to be in love with his victims. The women, some in their 30s, agreed to prove their real love even if it meant they had to have sex with a stranger as requested by the handsome man online. ""Internet crimes against children are modern crimes happening in a complex environment while the crime scenes are also 'in the cloud'. In this era of the digital economy and digital society, people live in the cloud,"" said TICAC head Tamasak Wicharaya, also an acting deputy commissioner-general of the Royal Thai Police. Each year, about 50,000 downloads and uploads of child pornography are detected in the kingdom by the task force. Such acts are now a crime in Thailand. On Dec 8, 2015, Thailand amended the Criminal Law stipulating penalties for the possession of child pornography as well as transferring or disseminating such material. The penalties include up to five years’ imprisonment and/or a fine of up to 100,000 baht for personal use, and up to seven years’ imprisonment and/or a fine of up to 140,000 baht for commercial use. A month later, TICAC was set up as an ad hoc agency to tackle internet crimes against children, with the support of Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwon in charge of national security and the officers of the Homeland Security Investigations attached to the US embassy in Bangkok. As of June 29, TICAC had received tip-offs and complaints about 129 incidents, with 36 being investigated. Out of these cases, 24 or 67% involve child pornography, eight or 22% involve child sexual abuse and four cases or 11% involve human trafficking. About a quarter of the total cases have been concluded. Among the 35 suspects, 29 were arrested, five foreigners were sent back to their own countries and one is pending charges. RELATED CRIMES Internet crimes against children, besides damaging the victims, are linked to other problems including human trafficking. Child porn images can be used to blackmail and force victims to do things against their will. Meanwhile, such material could lead to other sex crimes such as harassment and rape. Among the cases investigated by TICAC, the youngest victim was four years old. The victim, from an ethnic minority in Chiang Mai's Fang district, was held naked and photographed with the offender, who was also naked. Expert analysts said the pictures could be sexually arousing. If disseminated, they could arouse the viewers to commit sex crimes, Pol Gen Tamasak said. PREDATORS AND PREY TICAC keeps an eye on paedophiles, especially foreigners who have a history of child sexual abuse and those with a history of watching or producing child pornography, Pol Gen Tamasak said. When Thai authorities receive alerts from foreign agencies, such as the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children, the foreigners will be followed more closely. If they are spotted uploading or downloading porn images, police can request a warrant to search their residence and check their mobile phone and computer. If pornographic material is found, they are subject to a criminal lawsuit. ""Some foreigners portray themselves as a saints providing help and giving sweets to children. Once they gain trust of the children, they find a chance to be alone with them and record the victim being abused, then use the media to threaten and further abuse them,"" he added. Meanwhile, TICAC looks after vulnerable children. ""Children from poor families or broken homes are the most vulnerable. Once they fall prey to paedophiles, it is difficult for them to get over the experiences and live in society as normal. They will fall back again as a victim,"" Pol Gen Tamasak said. Poor children looking for work sometimes end up in the sex industry. Afterwards, they became subject of porn media which the offenders use to blackmail and force them to continue working in the industry, which is a recurring pattern in many cases, he added. Children from broken homes who spend a lot of time alone with stepfathers are also at risk. They are usually too frightened to speak out if they are sexually abused, he said. Reports from Khon Kaen and Nakhon Ratchasima revealed that children who have access to the internet are often lured by paedophiles who groom their victims through online communication. PREVENTIVE MEASURES Sex criminals have a higher reoffending rates than other criminals, Eric McLouglin, regional attache of the US Department of Homeland Security, said. Moreover, just as the criminals have networks to share information and adapt rapidly, authorities have to join hands and get ahead of the criminals and implement preventive measures before new crimes happen, he added. TICAC, together with its network including NCMEC, detect and locate uploaders and downloaders of pornographic material before going to search, investigate and take legal action against them before they can commit more crimes. Information from other security agencies also contribute to preventive measures. Last year, after requests to immigration police, 26 Americans were denied entry to Thailand as they had criminal records of child abuse. ""Human trafficking, especially involving children, is the most serious type of crime. The community has a right to know that you are a bad guy. We can locate where you are,"" Pol Gen Tamasak said. ""We are sending a clear message -- Thailand is no longer a safe haven for criminals,"" said the TICAC chief.  

 The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Homeland Security Investigations have organised a training course for police, social workers and non-governmental organisations. (Video by Pornprom Satrabhaya) INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION Among the cases concluded by TICAC, of the 129 incidents, information of 88 incidents, or 68%, came from foreign agencies including law enforcement, embassies and NGOs providing information about offenders, victims and the damaged parties. The FBI and the Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) have vowed to give full support to Thai police to bring wrongdoers to justice if Americans commit crimes in Thailand. Eight Americans have been prosecuted and several have been repatriated to serve penalties in the US. There are factors to consider in deciding whether to send the suspects back to their own country or to have them prosecuted in Thailand. Chief among these is the chance of a successful prosecution, said John Schachnovsky, FBI legal attache at the US embassy in Bangkok. Fighting such crimes needs collaboration from law enforcement officials, social workers and NGOs as well as the private sector, including telecommunication service providers. The special teams include victim analysts and digital forensic analysts. THE ROLE OF NGOs Many times, NGOs are the first to respond to victims. Mr Schachnovsky, who has been in Thailand for seven years, said many years ago NGOs and the police did not want to work with each other. ""Their attitude was 'we don't need them',"" said the FBI officer referring to the situation in the past. However, they later realised that they needed each other to successfully put the wrongdoers behind bars and protect innocent people. More NGOs are happy to join forces with the law enforcement team. Wirawan ""Boom"" Mosby, the 2017 recipient of the US Secretary of State Trafficking in Persons Report Hero Award, is also an active member of TICAC. The director of the Hope, Understanding and Grace (HUG) project in Chiang Mai has been providing investigative support through fact finding, case coordination and consultations with various law enforcement, social work, NGO and government officials. She also conducts key forensic interviews with child victims of trafficking and sexual abuse. She also spearheaded the opening of ACT (Advocacy Center For Children Thailand) House, the first such centre in Southeast Asia, which also has branches in Pattaya and Phuket. ""To make further progress, we need to educate and train people how to properly address these issues,"" Ms Mosby said in an interview with the Bangkok Post. ""Preconceived ideas and misconceptions have to be replaced with the right type of knowledge so that victims will be encouraged to seek help. They have to be told they are not at fault. We need more people with a heart for victims of sexual and domestic violence. It is pivotal to not prejudge their actions."" SPECIAL TRAINING Information from the victims is the key to success in an investigation, finding the wrongdoers and the prosecution. However, to get such information from victims and witnesses who have been through an ordeal is not easy, and sensitivity must be kept in mind. ""We want the entire story to come from the victim, not from us. Even if we go into the interview knowing a lot of factual information because evidence has been gathered, we still need all that information to come from the victim. And sometimes with younger children, it's a very difficult task to ask them to do that. So we need to make sure that we ask appropriate questions that a child can understand and can relate to and respond,"" said Crystal Gregory, forensic interview specialist and national programme manager at HSI. In the case of forced labour in the fisheries industry, police investigation stalled. Despite the evidence and witnesses' accounts, the police failed to get the victims' accounts. A key Cambodian victim lost his memory and refused to say anything as a result of being tortured on a boat. It took the police and related experts two years of patience and skills to help the victim regain his memory, and then he finally gave information that led to a successful prosecution, Pol Gen Tamasak said. From July 10-14, the FBI and the HSI as well as the US embassy organised a special training course on forensic interviewing of child and adolescent victims and witnesses for Thai police, social workers and NGOs including HUG from Chiang Mai, A21 from Pattaya and For Freedom International from Phuket. The course was on different skills and techniques to talk to victims of crimes such as trafficking in persons, child exploitation and forced child labour to ensure that the victims can feel safe and provide a safe environment to talk about the abuse they encountered, said Ms Gregory, one of the trainers. It also discussed victimisation, the effects of trauma and how a victim can face different problems throughout the process. The training also included steps to provide a safe environment in a neutral location, and to make sure that during the interview, the interviewers are not blaming the victims, Ms Gregory added. It was the same 40-hour basic training provided to the American investigation teams. The failure to properly interview victims will not only jeopardise the legal case but can also ruin the lives of the victims, especially when they are children, said the Department of Homeland Security's Mr McLouglin. Interviewing the victims of human trafficking and other forms of exploitation must be based on the principle of a victim-centric approach, he added. ""The interviewers need the skills and interview techniques to make sure that the victims are not re-victimised, and they must be interviewed in a safe place. Otherwise, they might see investigators as bad people and will not open up,"" Mr McLouglin said. Mr Schachnovsky said the interview must be in a friendly environment, not where uniformed police are walking around. Children's advocacy centres, currently available in Chiang Mai, Pattaya and Phuket, are examples of a suitable interview environment. The interviewer and the victim have a one-to-one interview in a room, which other investigators can watch from another room via video. ""We must keep in mind that the victims must be able to go back into society. Every part of the investigation is very important. If it fails, it will hurt the victims for their whole life,"" Mr Schachnovsky said. The group hopes to set the victim-centric approach as the standard for interviews. BUILDING TRUST, EXPANDING FORCES While Mr Schachnovsky praised the efficiency and effectiveness that TICAC has shown through its success in less than two years, Pol Gen Tamasak pointed out that it was a small team of committed people who understand each other. Meanwhile, it has gained understanding and assistance from police from different departments. They have to strengthen trust and regularly check among themselves to make sure that they are free from bad influences caused by the traumatic nature of their work. He hopes that the cooperation with NGOs can expand and more children's advocacy centres can be set up in Bangkok, Nakhon Ratchasima, Khon Kaen, Nakhon Pathom and Songkhla in the near future. TICAC currently has 40 officials from many departments of the Royal Thai Police. It is in the process of recruiting 130 more, Pol Gen Tamasak said.

Wirawan Mosby. Photo: Tawatchai Kemgumnerd In a ceremony held in Washington last month, the Chiang Mai activist received the award from the US State Department, with First Daughter Ivanka Trump beaming next to her. Small and determined, Wirawan has been honoured for her years of tracking and pursuing sex traffickers in the North. Records show that she has personally accounted for 20 arrests of suspects. Seven years ago, Wirawan, who was born in Chanthaburi but lives in Chiang Mai, stepped outside her comfort zone to dedicate her life to preventing human trafficking, as well as helping child victims and those who have suffered sexual abuse. A driving force behind her activism was a childhood desire to help a little girl whom she knew had been sexually exploited. ""I was too young to help her back then, so there was always a passion in me to be the voice of the voiceless when I grew older,"" said Wirawan, or Boom, the first Thai to win the award. ""When I became a lecturer in English literature, a number of my students used to confide in me about being sexually abused. Soon I found that such practices were common. I was involved with missionary work and I felt a calling to contribute my efforts in this area. I also felt in my heart a desire to see Thais become a society of willing volunteers."" Wirawan's small operation is purely based on volunteerism, without her making a single baht from it. In the past year, they have received donations from abroad which has enabled her to hire two local staff. ""That is why the award belongs to the entire team I work with, including law enforcement, who have been both dedicated and eager to address these social ills head on."" The honour given to Wirawan is an acknowledgment of her human rights work, and it also comes at a time when Thailand finds itself stuck on the Tier 2 Watch List of the US's Trafficking in Persons Report -- which indicates that more work needs to be done on the government level to tackle the problem. For her part, Wirawan, who stresses the help she's constantly received from state officers, hopes the TIP Report Hero Award can help their efforts to do better. Modest and unassuming, Wirawan is the director of the Hope Understanding and Grace (HUG) project, and she has spent countless hours building a network to best serve the multitudes of trafficking victims, the youngest being just a couple of months, to receive the help they need to lead as normal lives as possible. Based in Chiang Mai, she spearheaded the opening of ACT (Advocacy Center For Children Thailand) House, the first such centre in Southeast Asia, which also has branches in Pattaya and Phuket. Plans are under way to have a centre in Bangkok. She is also an active member of the Thailand Internet Crime Against Children task force. As an integral part of this team, her role is to collaborate with law enforcement and other agencies to facilitate investigation and prosecution of internet-facilitated crimes against children in Thailand. ""We have a dedicated group of law enforcement officers who have made it possible for us to not just bring about a sense of normalcy in the lives of child sexual survivors but also put perpetrators behind jail,"" said Wirawan. ""However, we have a long way to go. To make further progress, we need to educate and train people on how to properly address these issues. Preconceived ideas and misconceptions have to be replaced with the right type of knowledge so victims will be encouraged to seek help. They have to be told they are not at fault. We need more people with a heart for victims of sexual and domestic violence. It is pivotal to not prejudge their actions."" More recently, her role has been to provide investigative support through fact finding, case co-ordination and consultations with various law enforcement, social work, NGO and government officials; and conducting key forensic interviews with child victims of trafficking and sexual abuse. Wirawan is adamant about using her higher profile of late to forge ahead with promoting the expansion of the ACT concept throughout the country, seeking a victim-centred approach. Her work credentials include being a licensed Child Interviewer and being invited by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation/Homeland Security to observe their work with child forensic interviewing, using a multidisciplinary team approach. She has also been an official speaker on tackling human trafficking at TEDx Chiang Mai. ""I have to stress that we cannot expect the government to fix every issue,"" she added. ""It is the responsibility of each Thai citizen to work together to solve these problems. I have so far received exceptional support from the Royal Thai Police and local NGO partners."" While laws have their place, Wirawan said greater understanding of how to deal with child sex crime victims is urgently required. She said if one person is the victim of human trafficking, and if she or he is not ready mentally or physically to share her story, enforcing the law to do so should be the last resort. It is more important to show empathy as a human being, give the person a chance to heal and be strong and ready to confront what they have experienced. The law cannot restore a broken soul. Nipping the problem in the bud can only be successful when it is done collectively, she remarked. ""Social media has a huge influence on our lives, so if you happen to see yourself in a group where people are viewing child pornography, you can block it and encourage others to do so,"" she said. ""Also, take it upon yourself to report it to the police. ""Families have to also take a greater initiative to speak with their children about such issues as online human trafficking and help the child to be better equipped. I always tell my children what I do and how they can be safe. Parents need to keep a tab on just how much access their children have to the internet. Set up the computer in the living room so it can be used purely for educational purposes. ""If everyone collectively takes it upon themselves to do something about this, I believe we can make enormous progress. It is a team effort which needs to be conducted in a holistic manner."" Over the last two years, Wirawan said the Thai government has been taking a proactive role, especially in conducting more through investigations and taking the issues more seriously. Here again, she stressed that society should not solely depend on law enforcement to solve this complicated issue, because it is a joint effort that includes counsellors, parents and others. Public awareness to deal with such issues is always required, she said, so everyone should be encouraged to lend a hand in their own special way.

											Philippine police make more child cybersex arrests, rescues										",https://search.bangkokpost.com/track/visitAndRedirect?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bangkokpost.com%2Fthailand%2Fgeneral%2F1248322%2Fphilippine-police-make-more-child-cybersex-arrests-rescues&contentId=news1248322,"MANILA -- Authorities in the Philippines have rescued four girls and arrested a mother and two other women for allegedly livestreaming sexually exploitative videos of children to men paying by the minute to watch from the United States. Three sisters ages 8, 9 and 12, and an 11-year-old found in a separate rescue, are now in a shelter for abused children while the women face prosecution. The arrests came just two weeks after Filipino authorities raided the home of an American man suspected of similar cybersex crimes, arresting David Timothy Deakin, 53, in his townhouse. During that bust, agents from the National Bureau of Investigation rescued two girls, 10 and 12, who had spent time in Mr Deakin's home, and made one of the largest seizures of illicit digital content in the Philippines. Dozens of hard drives and a handful of computers must now be analysed to search for other possible victims, as well as buyers. Mr Deakin denied wrongdoing. “They got it twisted around like somehow I was using those girls,'' he told The Associated Press after his April 20 arrest. The series of arrests and rescues underscore a rapidly growing crime in which children, even toddlers, are made to remove their clothes and touch themselves in obscene ways while adults, often their parents, train video cameras on them in exchange for payment from paedophiles abroad. Police in the Philippines are collaborating with their counterparts in Europe, Australia and the US to investigate and prosecute. The Australian Federal Police and US FBI separately provided Filipino authorities information that led to the arrests of the mother and two other women on May 5, rescuing four girls. They were allegedly making the girls engage in sexually explicit acts while men in Australia and the US watched. The women have been charged with human trafficking, child abuse, child pornography and cybercrime. Police officer Arlyn Torrendon said she was part of a team that rescued three of the children and arrested the three women, including the mother of the siblings, Friday in a house in Bacolod city on an island about 717 kilometres south of Manila. “The children were innocent. They were not even aware that they were being used in a crime,'' Ms Torrendon told the AP by telephone from Bacolod. She said the children came from an impoverished family; their mother was a widow. Gen. Liborio Carabbacan at the National Police Women and Children Protection Centre said the incidents are increasing in the Philippines because many people are gaining access to the internet and English fluency is common, making it possible to communicate with would-be customers. Also, he said, parents and relatives, motivated by greed, are often not even aware that it is against the law to exploit their children. The livestream abuse happens in many of Philippines' densely populated, impoverished neighbourhoods, said attorney Gideon Cauton, who works with the non-profit International Justice Mission. The organization provides social workers, shelters, lawyers and even former US police detectives to local law enforcement, who don't have enough resources to tackle all cases of online sexual exploitation of children. In metropolitan Manila, where gleaming condominium high-rises and stores selling designer clothes and cars stand in stark contrast to the squalor of the slums, Mr Cauton pointed to Wi-Fi antennas rising from rooftops above a long stretch of shanties and rundown houses. In the past, the antennas amid crushing poverty were red flags, sparking suspicion of cybersex crimes. Today pocket Wi-Fi, mobile internet and other technology have rendered those irrelevant, driving the crime even further behind the scenes. “This type of crime is really hidden,'' he said. “Usually the family and community, they are complicit, and these are tight-knit communities, very dense areas.'' In the US, the proliferation of crimes, along with new mandatory reporting, led to 8.2 million reports last year to the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children's CyberTipline related to online child sexual exploitation. That compares with 8.3 million reports in the 17 years prior. One of those reports led authorities in the US to Karl Touset, 72, of Marietta, Georgia, who was sentenced to prison for 10 years in March after Homeland Security Investigations agents found evidence on his computers that he had paid facilitators in the Philippines more than $55,000 over three years for images of girls being sexually exploited. “Unfortunately, extreme poverty in many parts of the world affords individuals like Touset the opportunity to exploit children across national borders,'' said US Attorney John Horn in a statement after the sentencing."

											Big child webcam sex bust in Philippines										",https://search.bangkokpost.com/track/visitAndRedirect?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bangkokpost.com%2Fthailand%2Fspecial-reports%2F1246462%2Fbig-child-webcam-sex-bust-in-philippines&contentId=news1246462,"MABALACAT, Philippines -- The suspected paedophile could see people banging on his front door through his security cameras. Were they neighbours? Cops? One had letters on her jacket. As David Timothy Deakin googled “What is NBI?'' from the laptop on his bed, the Philippines National Bureau of Investigation smashed their way into his cybersex den. Children's underwear, toddler shoes, cameras, bondage cuffs, fetish ropes, meth pipes and stacks of hard drives and photo albums cluttered the stuffy, two-bedroom townhouse. Pencilled on the wall, someone had scrawled “My Mom and Dad love me'' and a broken heart. In his computer were videos and images of young boys and girls engaged in sex acts. “Why is everyone asking about children coming into my house?'' said Mr Deakin, 53, his wrists bound with a zip tie. Mr Deakin's arrest April 20 reveals one of the darkest corners of the internet, where paedophiles in the US, Canada, Europe and Australia pay facilitators on the other side of the world to sexually abuse children, even babies, directing their moves through online livestreaming services. The relatively new crime of webcam sex tourism is spreading rapidly, with new digital technologies sparking what the United Nations calls an “alarming growth of new forms of child sexual exploitation online''. The FBI says it's epidemic, and that at any given moment, 750,000 child predators are online. Almost every case stems from the Philippines, where good English speakers, increased internet connections and widespread international cash transfer systems combine with widespread poverty and easy access to vulnerable kids. There have been as many as three busts a week there this spring. The youngest victim ever, rescued a few weeks ago, was an infant, two months old. Most are under 12. This spring The Associated Press watched a raid, rescue and launch of a major investigation that continues to play out on both sides of the world. “This should serve as a warning,'' said NBI Anti-human trafficking chief Janet Francisco, who leads the case. “We will really catch them, with the help of our foreign counterparts. We will really put them in jail and they will die in jail.'' ____ In this April 20, 2017, photo, a young girl's shirt, a cowboy hat and pictures of suspected child webcam cybersex operator, David Timothy Deakin, lay on the floor during a raid in Mabalacat, Philippines. (AP photo) Bare-chested and slick with sweat, his breath sour and glasses foggy, Mr Deakin watched agents --including FBI computer analysts  -- crouch on his bed over open computers, rushing to find and preserve hidden files. The tip that led authorities to Mr Deakin came, as they often do, when an online international money transfer service notified an American internet provider about a suspicious account. Western Union, PayPal, and others have reported concerns in the past -- business names in this case are being withheld because of the ongoing investigation. Records in Mr Deakin's town house included debit cards for money transfer services, including Smart Money and Payoneer. The raid began just before dawn, as seven vanloads of police, investigators, lawyers and social workers rolled out of Manila, past rice paddies and water buffalos, and into a town that was once a large US military base, now a major red light district. The vans passed Fields Avenue, a notorious street lined with bars, strip clubs and massage parlours; shops advertise Viagra and lingerie-clad women beckon customers. When they reached Mr Deakin's apartment, a small cadre went to his door. Even as they burst in, he was streaming illicit content through the Tor network, which disguised his identity. Agents said he had a webpage open to wipe his phone clean. They tied him up with the first thing they could grab, an iPhone charging cord, before he could hit the button. “I'm a file pack rat”, said Mr Deakin. “I've got files of frigging everything”. AP and investigators asked him repeatedly why he had images of children engaged in sexual acts on his computer and bondage and fetish tools in his apartment. “I'm just a costumer'', he said at first, as if the leather wrist restraints and ropes in the second bedroom were just for dress-up. “I'm schizophrenic, you know”, he later told AP, looping his finger at his temple. He described a series of houseguests, people he let crash in his small place from down the street, other countries. Perhaps “some Danish guy'' used his computer. And this: “There was no children in front of the cam in my house, not even dressed, as far as I know, not even with their frigging mothers as far as I know.'' At one point, he told AP the images might have inadvertently slipped in when he downloaded massive files using BitTorrent. BitTorrent is a data tool used legitimately by academics and artists, but also by child pornographers and other criminals because large amounts of digital content can be moved and sorted. FBI agents looking for abusers search BitTorrent to spot people sharing exploitive images. Hours after his arrest, wrists tied behind his back, Mr Deakin grew nervous. Suspected child webcam cybersex operator David Timothy Deakin has his hands tied behind his back with an iPhone charging cord as members of the National Bureau of Investigation Anti-human Trafficking division arrest him inside his home during a raid in Mabalacat, Philippines. (AP photo) “I don't even know what you're frigging doing here!'' he yelled. Mr Deakin grew up in Peoria, Illinois, he said, “around the corn fields”. His family was splintered, his sister hated him and he didn't finish high school, he said. He was licensed as a roofing contractor in his 30s, seasonal work which left winters free; he used the time to study computers. Illinois court records show Mr Deakin was arrested on marijuana and drunken driving charges several times before visiting the Philippines in 1998. Two years later, he moved there for a job setting up internet service providers and installing Blackmagic livestreaming production programs. “The office computers were full of pornography”, Mr Deakin would write to Filipino authorities three years later, when an inter-office argument led to immigration charges. The charges were dismissed, and he was supposed to leave the country. But he stayed, remotely running computer systems for clients around the world, and hosting, he said, tens of thousands of websites as well. In recent years, Mr Deakin said, he earned $30 an hour as a systems administrator. But his home was filled with junk, his refrigerator near empty. Stacks of used egg cartons fell from the shelves, and a half-eaten pot of cold rice sat on the stove. “You know what you've done in this room”, an investigator told Mr Deakin. She showed him a photo he had of several children. Shrugging, he said one of them was probably a few doors away with her cousin. Minutes later, two girls, 9 and 11 years old, were rescued by police. AP did not interview the girls Mr Deakin told police about; victims of such raids need immediate and long-term counselling and care. But in the tranquil garden of a shelter for sexual exploitation survivors about 60 miles south of Mr Deakin's town house, 19-year-old Cassie described her ordeal. AP did not use her whole name to protect her privacy. The youngest daughter in an impoverished family of 14, Cassie believed the man who came to her village and promised her a better life and family support if she would go to the city with him. When he told her he would be selling her, she had no idea what that meant. “I was laughing”, she said. Cassie was 12. Within months the man bleached her dark skin, straightened her hair, and began waking her at 4am to meet customers. She started working as a cybersex model. “He needed some girl to show her whole body in front of the camera”, she said. He told her it was her job, in exchange for an education. Over time, six more girls came to live in the house, and one had a baby. At school Cassie tried to act normal, hiding her secret from classmates. At home she was terrified and thinking about suicide. The abuse ended when her older sister found out. Furious, she went to the police. Dolores Rubia, who runs aftercare programs for rescued girls through Washington DC-based NGO International Justice Mission , said parents and relatives turn to online exploitation to for easy money. Some consider it benign, she said, because they think children don't mind taking off their clothes. But that exposure is abuse, and it often escalates. “It's a myth for some of them, that nothing is wrong”, she said. “That anyway, these children are not physically touched and the perpetrators are actually overseas”. Buyers abroad also sometimes try to use the lack of contact as an excuse for their crimes. “The people I was talking to were hurting people, hurting children in a way that I would never have allowed in my presence”, said Scott Peeler, a former Southbridge, Massachusetts middle school maths teacher who admitted he tried to buy live video feeds of children having sex in the Philippines. “I drifted into a world that repulses me”, he said. Mr Peeler was sentenced in March to 11 years in federal prison. “It's not just a virtual crime. It is an actual crime”, said human rights attorney Sam Inocencio, who heads International Justice Mission's Philippines office, which supports local law enforcement with investigators and attorneys. “Online sexual exploitation is possibly the most evil thing that I've seen.'' ___ Bondage cuffs used for sexual acts during a raid at the home of suspected child webcam cybersex operator, David Timothy Deakin, in Mabalacat, Philippines. (AP photo) The first high-profile international case of livestreaming sexual exploitation of children was reported in 2011 out of the Philippines. The proliferation of smart phones and wi-fi have led to rapid growth. Perpetrators now use bitcoin or untraceable credit cards. By livestreaming, they bypass digital markers law enforcement embeds in illegal content to catch people downloading, sharing or saving child pornography on computers or in the Cloud. Once isolated, paedophiles now operate with virtual anonymity, sharing images and children, say experts. In 2013, online sex exploitation of children gained global attention after researchers at the Netherlands-based non-profit Terre des Hommes launched a realistic-looking animation of a 10-year-old Filipino girl named Sweetie. They took the fake girl on chat groups and online forums. Paedophiles swarmed. In 10 weeks, analysts identified 1,000 men in 71 countries who had tried to get illegal images. Last year, UK-based Internet Watch Foundation worked to remove 57,335 URLs with child sexual abuse imagery. The websites were hosted on 2,416 domains, up from 1,991 in 2015. The proliferation of crimes, along with new mandatory reporting, led to 8.2 million reports last year to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children's CyberTipline related to online child sexual exploitation. That compares with 8.3 million reports in the 17 years prior. One of those reports led analysts to a four-time convicted sex offender, Louis Francis Bradley, 66, of Baltimore, Maryland, last year. He had paid at least 17 people in the Philippines to take sexually explicit photos of prepubescent girls and share them with him on Facebook. He also admitted in March to paying women to expose their genitals using video streaming programs. “can u get any really young girls'' he asked in one online chat. Mr Bradley was sentenced May 2 to 35 years in prison. Because it's a newer crime, legal systems grapple with how to prosecute. In the US, the buyers are typically charged with possessing, distributing or producing child pornography. In the Philippines, it's a human trafficking crime. In 2015, five people were convicted of online child sex trafficking in the Philippines. Mr Deakin has been charged with cybercrime, child pornography, child abuse and child trafficking. Officials at both ends of the abuse agree they need to collaborate to stop it, and last month the US committed $3 million. Philippines National Police Gen Liborioi Carabbacan said they're trying to raise public awareness, letting parents and children know it's illegal. One woman forced into prostitution as a child turned the cameras on her own kids when she grew up, he said. “She thought that's already the norm”, he said. ___ Mr Deakin's bust turned out to be one of the largest seizures of its kind in the Philippines, and also a first for investigators on the case who caught the suspect in the act. His Cheery Mobile Touch HD tablet -- which can be wiped clean and reset with a four digit code --  had more than 4,000 contacts. One computer had another 13 networked into it, from servers he said around the world. There were 30 hard drives. “The suspect is really a highly technical person, he is computer savvy, so he was able to hide several computers within the computer,'' said Chief Francisco. Investigators hope digital forensics will lead them to rescue dozens, possibly hundreds, of victims. And they expect to catch more conspirators in the wider syndicate, both in the Philippines and abroad. Neighbours who gathered to watch the raid knew something was wrong in that house. “No, no, not drugs”, said a man who rolled up on a bike. “Computers. Sex. Children.'' Josue Santos, who patrols the neighbourhood on foot, said he saw seven children, 3 boys and 4 girls, heading into Mr Deakin's home one evening a few months ago. Others nodded. Bessie Geronimo, across the street, was teary-eyed. She'd seen children going in and out. Now, she wondered, could she have intervened? “How could they do such a thing?'' she asked. “Oh, I pity those children.'' Authorities from a village police substation said a housekeeper filed a complaint against Mr Deakin last year: he wasn't paying her, she said, and she was worried about what he was doing with children in the bedroom with the door closed. They visited his house but had no authority for a raid. “There are many such places”, said security officer Mike Wood. Before Mr Deakin was taken to jail, he asked for a cigarette. He asked to use the bathroom. He asked for his Bible. And he said he'd been planning to leave town. Just one day earlier, he had texted a friend: “I've got to get out of here”."

											Cambodian court holds Dutch man on child pornography charges										",https://search.bangkokpost.com/track/visitAndRedirect?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bangkokpost.com%2Fworld%2F1236139%2Fcambodian-court-holds-dutch-man-on-child-pornography-charges&contentId=news1236139,"PHNOM PENH - A man from the Netherlands was formally charged in a Cambodian court for taking nude photos of boys and possessing at least 1,300 pornographic pictures. Evrard Nicolas Sarot, 53, has been detained on child pornography charges, Siem Reap provincial court spokesman Yim Srang said on Friday. Production of child pornography is punishable by 5-10 years in prison, while the sentence for its sale or distribution is 10-20 years. The court's action came after Sarot was arrested on Tuesday in the northwestern province, home to the famous Angkor Wat temple, while photographing naked boys aged 11-15 years whom he had allegedly paid to strike erotic poses. Police began investigating Sarot on the basis of information supplied by Action Pour Les Enfants, a non-governmental organisation that combats child sex abuse. The group said that about 20 boys, all of them under 15 years of age, were paid a few dollars each to come to a deserted area to be photographed. The group said it had been tipped off last year by an informant. ""This arrest marks the third foreign man arrested in child abuse cases in Cambodia this year,'' the group said in a statement, noting that the victims were all boys, a warning that predators don't target only girls. Last week a prosecutor in southern Takeo province charged a Cambodian-American man with sexually abusing 11 boys aged 10 -15 years. Poverty and poor law enforcement have made Cambodia a magnet for foreign pedophiles, but the government has cracked down on sex offenders in the past decade."

One of them has a picture of two women -- both dressed in wedding gowns -- in each others loving embrace. The other was a group picture of drag queen performers. ""It's a souvenir,"" said the 31-year-old gay Chinese filmmaker, who was recently in Bangkok for the screening of Be A Woman, his 2011 documentary on Chinese drag queens. The film revolves around a group of drag queen performers at a bar called Only Love in Nanning, southern China. It took Fan three years to get all the footage. At the same time, he was working for the Beijing LGBT centre, as well as organising a queer film festival around China. ""I also had to take a part-time job to survive,"" said Fan with a laugh. Despite life's other callings, he reverted back to the drag queen bar almost religiously. With his small HD camera, Fan followed his subjects on and offstage. One minute, they were swaying and singing beautiful tunes for the cheering crowd. At others, they took off their hairpiece to reveal their short hair underneath, recounting the stories of their lives. Drag queen performances, said Fan, used to be quite popular in China. In the 2000s, a few bars in Beijing would offer drag queen shows in ancient and traditional styles with flowing Chinese costumes similarly to that of the Peking opera, a long tradition in which men perform as female characters. The world got a glimpse of this tradition in Ba wang bie ji (Farewell My Concubine). And now Fan has documented the realistic, modern take of the tradition. These performances have been overtaken by go-go dances and upbeat DJs in recent years before returning in a Westernised format. ""It's quite sad for us to see the show disappearing,"" Fan said. The show is funny, ironic and full of people lip-syncing their way through the show. In his film, we witness performers singing in their real voices. Cross-dressing and drag queen performances receive a certain level of understanding and tolerance in China, said the filmmaker. ""Some people view them as very artistic."" But when the issue transcends into matters like homosexuality and transsexuality, it strives on an entirely different route with the people. He mentioned a famous Chinese TV host and transwoman Jin Xing (the ""Chinese Oprah Winfrey"" as Fan describes her). Some Chinese LGBTI, despite the seeming intolerance in the country, are accepted and respected by society. Tragically, other transgender individuals live on the street, picking up garbage to survive. ""People have this image that the transgender have to be beautiful to get respect. If not, they are then discriminated against by mainstream society."" Even gay men in China do not take too well to the trans community. As Fan is on the committee for the Beijing Queer Film Festival, in the past he received suggestions to now screen transgender films as some gay men say these films make them look bad. ""They said they are only in love with people of the same gender. They didn't want people to mistake them as wanting to change their sex,"" said Fan in a half angry, half disappointed tone. ""No matter how normal you think you are, for mainstream society, we are all freaks. We're all different and weird. You shouldn't use how mainstream society looks at us to look down upon the transgender community."" Making Be A Woman, said Fan, is one way to show support for the transgender community. Aside from the drag queen tale, Fan is also known for his family-themed documentaries Mama Rainbow (2012) and Papa Rainbow (2016) -- both of which feature Chinese parents talking about their support for their LGBTI children. Due to the country's censorship, Fan's works weren't able to be screened in Chinese cinemas. Within his own country, these documentaries have found their way on smaller screens inside cafes, universities and galleries. But outside the country, Fan is jet-setting the globe to screen his films at different festivals. It's a known fact that the Chinese government is rarely keen on any good depictions of LGBTI characters within its media. Its brutal censorship means that films with homosexual or transgender characters aren't allowed to be screened in cinemas, unless they are depicted in a small, stereotypical and stigmatised nature. ""The regulation is quite blurry, really,"" said Fan. ""It doesn't say clearly that they are banning LGBTI films, but rather ones that talk about political, erotic pornography. And, according to the censorship board, LGBTI films are under that label."" The censorship doesn't affect films alone, but also film festivals with a LGBTI theme. The Beijing Queer Film Festival, which was established in 2001, has been subjected to police raids and shutdown over the years. The authority's harassment meant the organisers have to pull together their wit and tricks to pull off each festival. Once, the festival relocated to eight different locations in five days in order to avoid shutdown. Sometimes, the organisers would rent a bus and screen films on it. One year, they got people on a train and distribute USB drives for them to watch the film on their laptops -- everyone pressed play at the same time to watch the film together. It's a tiring game of cat and mouse, but Fan said his team is not giving up. ""No matter how many challenges we face, we still want to do it. We can't stop and we're not going to stop just because the authority wants to stop us."" ""I think film is such an important platform for society to see what we are, where we are and what we're doing,"" he said, adding it's the reason why he choose to work on films about gender diversity. He is capturing history. And he recounted that his audiences said his documentaries have helped several families in coming to terms with gender issues. Step by step, he views it as part of the strength to change society. It is difficult to say whether regulations will be lifted in the near future. But Fan remains positive. In his view, people are growing more accepting of gender diversity and are more willing to talk about it, even publicly. ""We still have hope,"" he insisted. After a decade working on documentaries, Fan said he will branch out into fictional features, beginning with a story about queer life in urban China. He's working on the script and is deciding whether to shoot the film in Beijing or Shanghai."

Shabudin Yahaya, a member of the Barisan Nasional coalition, made the comments in response to a proposal by an opposition member of parliament to amend the Sexual Offences Against Children bill to include a ban on child marriages. The proposal was voted down by the majority of parliament. ""They reach puberty at the age of nine or 12. And at that time, their body is already akin to them being 18 years old. So physically and spiritually, it is not a barrier for the girl to marry,"" Shabudin said on Tuesday during a debate on the bill. He also said there was ""nothing wrong"" with a rape victim marrying her rapist as she would then not face a ""bleak future"". Shabudin's comments sparked outrage on social media, with some opposition politicians asking for him to be fired. In a statement on Wednesday, Shabudin said his comments were taken out of context, and that marriage was not a ""back door exit to legalise rape."" He said he rejected the motion to ban child marriages as it was contrary to provisions in sharia law. Under both civil law and Islamic law, girls and boys younger than 18 can be married. Civil law sets the minimum age of marriage at 18, but those above 16 can be married with the permission of their state's chief minister. Under Islamic law, children younger than 16 can get married if the Shariah courts allow it. The law passed on Tuesday makes no mention of child marriage. It criminalises ""grooming"" - touching and befriending children as a prelude to sexual abuse - and spells out penalties for making and possessing pornography involving those under 18. A special court will also be set up under the new law to deal with child sexual abuse cases more quickly. The maximum penalty under the law is a jail term of up to 30 years and six strokes of the whip for making, possessing or distributing child pornography. The new law comes into effect ten months after British paedophile Richard Huckle was found guilty of abusing up to 200 babies and children, mostly in Malaysia. Reuters news agency reported last year that most complaints of child sexual abuse in Malaysia do not lead to successful prosecutions, largely due to weaknesses in the criminal justice system. Only 140 of the 12,987 cases of child sexual abuse reported to police between 2012 and July 2016 resulted in convictions. ""The law is more stringent now... but not enough,"" said Teo Nie Ching, the opposition MP who proposed the ban child marriages. She said offenders would use the absence of a ban on child marriages to get away with crimes as marital rape is not a crime in Malaysia. There have been several cases over the years of rapists marrying theirs victim, including those under 18, to avoid prosecution."

The new law comes into effect ten months after British paedophile Richard Huckle was found guilty of abusing up to 200 babies and children, mostly in Malaysia. Reuters reported last year that most complaints of child sexual abuse in Malaysia do not lead to successful prosecutions, largely due to weaknesses in the criminal justice system. Only 140 of the 12,987 cases of child sexual abuse reported to police between 2012 and July 2016 resulted in convictions. ""The law is more stringent now... but not enough,"" Teo Nie Ching, the opposition MP who proposed the ban child marriages, told Reuters. She said offenders would use the absence of a ban on child marriages to get away with crimes as marital rape is not a crime in Malaysia. There have been several cases over the years of rapists marrying theirs victim, including those under 18, to avoid prosecution."

Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a press release that the juvenile suspect faces felony charges of aggravated criminal sexual assault, manufacturing of child pornography and dissemination of child pornography. ""Additional arrests are expected as the investigation continues,'' Mr Guglielmi said. Police superintendent Eddie Johnson is slated to provide more details at a news conference Sunday morning. The alleged incident occurred in mid-March. Mr Guglielmi has said police were not aware of the attack until the girl's mother approached Mr Johnson as he was leaving a police station on the city's West Side and showed him the video. Mr Guglielmi said Mr Johnson was ""visibly upset'' after he watched, both by the video's content and the fact that there were ""40 or so live viewers and no one thought to call authorities"". Police have said the attack involved five or six males. The girl's mother told The Associated Press last month that her daughter received online threats following the attack. The Chicago Sun-Times later reported that the girl's family had been relocated. The video marks the second time in recent months that Chicago police have investigated an apparent attack that was broadcast live on Facebook. In January, four people were arrested after video showed them allegedly taunting and beating a mentally disabled man."

The unnamed man has admitted to taking thousands of pornographic pictures of the boys, but denied allegations that he molested some of them and pushed some into prostitution, according to prosecutors in the western Swiss canton of Fribourg. The crimes in Thailand are alleged to have taken place in Pattaya and Chiang Mai starting in 2001, the year the man moved to the country. He returned to Switzerland in 2014. The man had previously been convicted of sexually abusing children in Switzerland: in Fribourg in 1980, and in the southern canton of Valais in 1991, according to a report by Al Jazeera. The man will go before the Gruyere criminal court on charges of human trafficking, encouraging prostitution, sexual acts with children and child pornography, prosecutors said. Most of the victims were young adolescents, but some were as young as nine years old, they said, adding that a number of the boys had been abused over several years. The suspected abuse took place in Pattaya, where the man ran a bar frequented by Europeans, and in Chiang Mai, where he lived, according to prosecutors. Discovering that he was under investigation in Thailand for paedophilia-linked charges, authorities in Fribourg opened their own investigation in early 2015 and quickly detained the man, who had been planning to return to Asia. Investigators travelled to France and Thailand and also stumbled on elements casting suspicion on a German citizen that they passed on to prosecutors in Cologne, Germany, the statement said."

Consensual sexual intercourse with minors of 14 and above carries a maximum jail term of 10 years or fine or both in Singapore. The legal age of consent is 16. Joshua Robinson, 39, was convicted last week of the sex acts, which he had filmed, and for showing child pornography to a six-year-old. Prosecutors had asked for a sentence of 4-5 years and a S$20,000 ($14,200) fine. They said they were not planning to appeal. ""I have asked my officials to consider what approaches are necessary for offenders like Robinson to be dealt with more severely through higher penalties,"" Law and Home Affairs Minister K.

Petitions are rare in Singapore where state institutions benefit from strong public support. ""Wow...4 years of jail without caning for a paedophile?"" said the petition started by Sarah Woon, a friend of a woman whose daughter was shown pornographic films by Robinson. Robinson's lawyer, Mervyn Tan, declined to comment on the case before March 15, when the deadline for an appeal expires. Last year, parliament passed a controversial contempt of court law which set penalties for publishing material that interferes with ongoing procedures or alleges bias on the part of judges.

											A safer internet for children										",https://search.bangkokpost.com/track/visitAndRedirect?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bangkokpost.com%2Fopinion%2Fopinion%2F1163049%2Fa-safer-internet-for-children&contentId=news1163049,"The internet is an extraordinarily powerful tool but unsupervised use in the hands of children can lead to devastating consequences. Curiosity can get the better of them, even when their intention is entirely innocent -- searching for a favourite band on YouTube for example. Further searches sometimes lead down a very dark path. In addition to being exposed to disturbing content, some children unwittingly become victims of online pornographers and traffickers. Parents are at their wits' end in their attempts to remain a step ahead of predators on the lookout for their next victim. If we profess that children are our greatest resource, the future of our country, we must prioritise their well-being, to the point of placing it on the national agenda if need be. Driving home this point recently were experts in the field of child services and information and communications technology (ICT) at the eighth biennial international consultation of Child Helpline International in Bangkok. This diverse array of stakeholders and child protection advocates from more than 100 countries pooled their knowledge in an attempt to create a real, sustainable and lasting impact on young lives. While discussions touched on areas pertaining to combating all types of violence against children and gender inequality, a lot of time was devoted to the role of ICT. A workshop by Facebook, for example, focused on different approaches to help children be safe online. Mofya Chisala, director of the ICT regulator in Zambia, spoke of more tangible ways to address the dangers the internet can pose. He suggested sharing valuable experiences with people in the field, so precious time is not wasted during a crisis. While the problems children face with the internet are similar across the world, the right methods of addressing them are of utmost importance; what works in the African context might not necessarily work as well in Asia or other regions. The most obvious dangers of the internet for young people involve pornography, he said. Cyberbullying has also become a major concern. Mr Chisala noted that internet predators are expert manipulators, able to foster a relationship of dependence with a teenager. Social networks such as Facebook thus need to be monitored, and parents need to be aware of the influences their children absorb online, he said. Mr Chisala favours the development of a broad database, where child helpline agencies can pool their experiences so that when an issue arises, they can have quick access to successful solutions. He said it was a waste of time reinventing methodologies when others had already developed them, so everyone in the field should learn from others' experiences as well as share their own. This, I believe, hit the nail on the head when it came to expeditiously working to help a victim and bring perpetrators to justice. We might come from different countries, but because we live in one world, our children need to be protected no matter where they happen to be. Mr Chisala's strategy can definitely benefit Thailand, where we tend to waste a lot of precious time searching for solutions and putting them in place, instead of first looking around to see how others have addressed similar cases. On a positive note, I have to commend our own ICT experts for making strides of their own to curb the movement of online perpetrators; however, there is still a lot left to accomplish. Laws have to be strictly implemented. For example, internet cafe owners have to be held accountable for allowing underage patrons to access content that could put them in imminent danger. I would even go so far as to suggest partitioning an area where children under age 18 can use computers that allow access only to material compatible for their age. Parents and communities have to also band together to keep children's best interests at heart. Mobile phone use in particular needs closer supervision now that the handset is becoming the first-choice gateway to the online world. Adults, including relatives, family friends and teachers, also need to make more time in their busy schedules to listen to youngsters. As minors, they are sitting targets for internet predators, especially when the child has no one to speak with. Remember the good old days when parents spoke with their children around the dinner table or before bedtime? It's not just a great way to connect with one's child but also helps keep them safe from impending danger. Wouldn't you agree?"

Chelsea and Crystal Palace dismissed a police warning about a scout who had been convicted for importing child-abuse images, a retired detective warns Clive Driscoll, who rose to the rank of chief inspector before retiring, said he might as well have been phoning ""from the moon"" when he made the call in 2001 about the scout John Butcher. Butcher was convicted in 1993 of attempting to smuggle child-abuse images into England from the Netherlands and in 2009 he was put on the sex offenders register for seven years after he was caught looking at indecent images. Butcher, 67, is adamant he has ""never physically abused children"". The revelations -- which will add to the deepening dismay of how football reacted to the allegations at the time in a scandal that has rocked the foundations of the multi-billion pound sport -- come days after London police revealed they were looking into allegations of abuse at 30 London clubs including four unnamed Premier League sides. It was after Butcher's earlier offence that Driscoll got in touch with Chelsea, Crystal Palace and Millwall over Butcher, who operated as a freelance scout. ""I spoke to Millwall, Chelsea and Palace about Butcher and warned them about him in 2001,"" he said. ""I was a detective inspector at the time and I was phoning them from the police, but I might as well have been phoning from the moon. ""I was saying he had a conviction but they just treated it as a football matter."" Driscoll, who successfully brought the killers of black teenager Stephen Lawrence to trial after years of frustration over the initial investigation on the part of the victim's family, said he impressed on the clubs the seriousness of the matter. ""All they were concerned about was that he was a good scout, the football -- I was saying this is slightly more important than that, that this guy had a conviction for importing child pornography."" His revelations will make further uncomfortable reading for Chelsea -- whose present owner, the Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, took over two years after Driscoll informed the club of Butcher's conviction. His regime was lambasted for imposing a gagging order on former youth player Gary Johnson as a condition of a 2015 agreement to pay him 50,000 pounds ($63,850, 59,230 euros) over abuse he suffered at the hands of former scout Eddie Heath. Several other former Chelsea youth players -- including a retired policeman -- have come forward since Johnson broke the gagging order to allege Heath, who died in 1983 aged 54, had either abused them or they knew of his abuse. Chelsea have launched an investigation -- headed by a lawyer -- into the allegations about Heath with some speculating that the club could face a group action law suit costing them potentially millions. Heath was sacked by Chelsea in 1979 by then manager Geoff Hurst, not for sexual impropriety but because he spent more time decorating his office than scouting. He moved on to another London club, Charlton Athletic, where a former youth player alleges he was abused by him. Johnson told the BBC he is going to seek greater compensation for the abuse as it had ""taken away my childhood"". Palace too have been severely criticised for their attitude to Driscoll's phone call in a report published on sex abuse at childrens' care homes in south London by a support group called the Shirley Oaks Survivors Association. ""When former Met (London Police) Officer Clive Driscoll approached Crystal Palace with regard to concerns about Butcher they were dismissive and derisory,"" read the report. ""We now know that numerous children were taken from Shirley Oaks to Crystal Palace for special treats, sanctioned by the management."" Palace said they were looking into the allegations but added that, as far as they knew, Butcher never had a formal role at the club."

ILGA -- the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association -- is the world federation that works to protect the people's right to express their sexual orientation and gender identity. And its 28th world conference, a first in Thailand, saw hundreds of gender activists from across the globe gathering to discuss issues pertaining to the lives of LGBTI persons. Of course, one of the most anticipated sessions of the conference was a special Q&A with Vitit himself. Vitit, a law professor at Chulalongkorn University, was tasked to investigate violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. His appointment came at the end of September, much to the delight of the LGBTI population worldwide. He was also involved in the setting-up of the Yogyakarta Principles -- a set of principles regarding the application of international human-rights law that addresses issues of sexual orientation and gender identity -- back in 2006. Aside from the protection of LGBTI rights, he has watched over the human-rights situations of North Korea and Syria, as well as issues like child prostitution and child pornography. Life has compiled an abridged and edited version of Vitit's talk. Questions and topics came from gender advocates attending the ILGA World Conference. How did you become the UN Independent Expert on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity? It was really a voluntary spirit. I'm not a UN official. I'm appointed by the UN as a volunteer pro bono, and I'm not paid by the UN. I'm here helping as a volunteer in spirit to help protect people worldwide. How can activists contribute to the mandate? The mandate holder -- the UN independent expert -- has three key roles. One is to prepare a report for the UN periodically. So the first report on the protection of people's rights from violence and discrimination in regards to sexual orientation and gender identity has to be done by June. So, by March, if you have good recent information on all these issues, please send the information to us, particularly to the UN in Geneva. Second, I will do country visits and learn about the situation of sexual orientation and gender identity, balancing between developed and developing countries of different regions. Third, the UN special procedures of which the UN independent expert is a member is basically a special procedure to receive complaints from people in regards to actual or potential violations of a rather serious nature. This past week, we were taking a complaint in regard to a certain country, and we are responding to this by contacting the country concerned to ask for justice, to ask for leniency, to ask for clarification of information. Hearing from you directly, we can use information to advocate in the UN to protect people, to promote their rights to be free from violence and discrimination. And that's why we're here to be of help to everyone. How do you intend to work with states that voted for, as well as against, your mandate? States voted in certain ways for certain political reasons, not just for LGBTI reasons but broader political reasons. And as a mandate holder, having dealt with many issues for the UN, I always sought to link up with, to dialogue with, not only the yes vote, but also the no vote. It's very important to rationalise with all countries in an amicable spirit on the basis of international law. One of the priorities of my work is to build bridges including with any country, however they voted. No entity is monolithic. You will always find someone, even among those governments slightly more open to discussions and discourse with us. In what way do you intend to support the LGBTI movement in terms of health and education? My own approach as a lawyer is actually to be less legal. I'm not fixated on law. I'm fixated on broad comprehensive intervention of an intersectional kind. For the past 10 to 20 years, we've been criticising these terrible laws that criminalise consensual safe-sex conduct as well as cross-dressing. We need to look at other intervention, like the stigmatisation of LGBTI through medical classification that says LGBTI are mentally ill or are suffering from disorder or dysphoria. We have to find a way of moving beyond those labels so as to ensure that people feel protected. With education, it comes to creating empathy and nurturing socialisation so that people have an understanding attitude from a young age. And one of the issues that we look into, for example, is how do we educate people to be less fixated on the binary heterosexual norm? These are issues with which I hope to work with all kinds of agencies and constituencies so that we look at and tackle these issues from the areas of prevention, protection, remediation and participation through a key range of entry points, not just law. How would your mandate raise visibility and defend the rights of those not so prominent and well represented in the LGBTI community? One term that's been used several times in discussions and the mandate is ""intersectionality of causes, effects, people, actions, actors, consequences and remedies"", which means that we have to broaden our understanding of the chain of consequences linked with people in different categories and groups. Indigenous people, asylum seekers, migrant workers, elderly persons, other minorities and more -- that is the sort of spectrum we have to work with. With the report that goes to the UN, we must make them meaningful by ensuring that the voice of the people is heard, reflected and re-reflected through the reports to the UN and beyond to reach out particularly to those who're not with us, but who should be. Everyone should be with us in spirit, at least."

Earlier this year, Twitter announced it had suspended 360,000 accounts, mostly linked to the Islamic State group, as part of a stepped-up effort to curb terrorism-linked talk on the social network	 Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft and Google-owned YouTube announced Monday a drive to stop the proliferation of videos and messages showing beheadings, executions and other gruesome content, posted by the likes of the Islamic State group or Al-Qaeda. The move comes as social media giants face increasing scrutiny over their role in the explosion of so-called ""fake news"" -- which is believed to have influenced the US election -- as well as online bullying and hate speech. Platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have struggled for years with this issue, seeking to be open to free speech without being used to promote violence or hate. But with the rampant use of the networks by jihadists to plan, recruit and depict violent attacks, the tech platforms were forced to take a stronger stand. ""There is no place for content that promotes terrorism on our hosted consumer services,"" they said in a joint statement. James Lewis, a senior fellow who follows technology and security issues at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, believes social media have reached a turning point, and can no longer claim to be ""neutral platforms."" ""They can't evade responsibility anymore,"" Lewis said. ""Terrorist content is only the start,"" he said. ""Now they have to figure what to do about hate speech, racism and bullying."" Monday's joint statement did not indicate what type of technology would be used in the new initiative, except to say it would be based on a shared industry database of ""hashes"" or digital fingerprints that identify jihadist content. Some critics have suggested that such content could be curbed by using a template could be a program that is already employed by online firms to block child pornography. - No easy answer - Peter Weinberger, a senior researcher at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism at the University of Maryland, said there is no simple technological solution to the problem of jihadist content. ""It's a little more difficult to do than child pornography where you have very clear, objectionable content,"" he said. ""A lot of times terrorist recruiters can package stuff in a more savvy way. They use speech which is coded."" Weinberger said the effort ""is commendable but they will need to have designated personnel who will need to constantly review material because it is always changing."" Earlier this year, Twitter announced it had suspended 360,000 accounts, mostly linked to the Islamic State group, as part of a stepped-up effort. But research has shown that jihadist groups quickly migrate to new accounts, taking advantage of the anonymity of Twitter. Lewis said it would appear feasible to implement the new initiative because the companies could rely on international treaties which define terrorism and organizations supporting those efforts. Governments in the United States, France and elsewhere have been pressing online firms to do more to curb extremist content, especially videos that depict beheadings and other gruesome acts often used in recruitment efforts. At least one lawsuit filed in France on behalf of a victim in the 2015 Paris attacks seeks to hold Facebook, Google and Twitter liable for the violence. - Civil liberties issue? - But Chris Calabrese of the Center for Democracy & Technology, an online civil liberties advocate, called the new effort ""worrisome."" ""We think the precedent of governments leaning on companies to do any centralized censorship could lead to a lot of negative consequences,"" Calabrese said. ""It's not just extreme and barbaric content that governments want to suppress. It's lots of other types of content like hate speech and copyright violations. It's a slippery slope."" Calabrese said that ""there is no guarantee the program will work"" in curbing the spread of violence and extremist content. He said that to ensure the program is not abused, ""companies should not take any censorship requests from governments,"" and there should be an appeal mechanism ""for correcting any mistakes.""   "

Thailand's resort town of Pattaya has more expat paedophiles than anywhere in the world, both abusing children and producing pornography. Unfortunately, various efforts made to combat sexual exploitation of children in Thailand are made in isolation. To better tackle this problem, there is a need for greater collaboration and information sharing among organisations and coalitions working on anti-trafficking. We need to solve the long-standing systemic challenges that Thailand faces by devising a comprehensive national strategy for child exploitation prevention and interdiction. This effort should be built on the existing sense of urgency and especially on international partnerships. In past years, human trafficking in Thailand has been front-page news. However, as one of the first countries to bring the issue of human trafficking to the world stage in the early 1990s, we should not forget Thailand's past achievements, including the passing of the 2008 Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act. This year's upgrade of Thailand from Tier III on the US Trafficking in Persons Report (TIP) to Tier II (Watch List) holds out hope for Thailand making further improvements. Throughout the country, there are many individuals and organisations committed to anti-trafficking work including raising awareness, legal and policy reform, and victim support and prevention. Combating child sex tourism is also part of their crucial efforts. The sexual exploitation of children is worsening because of cheaper international travel and the exchange of information regarding child victims' locations by sexual predators via the internet. The US Department of State estimates that over one million children are being sexually exploited globally. Sexual exploitation of children is often doubly illegal. As well as being subject to local laws, it can be prosecuted in the perpetrator's country of origin. For instance, in the US the 2003 Federal PROTECT Act fortified the prosecution and imprisonment of criminals and removed the statute of limitations on child abuse. In 2008, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) launched its Child Sex Tourism Initiative to investigate and prosecute these crimes and to provide victims with services. This initiative now works alongside law enforcement and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in Thailand. Until recently, Thailand faced a specific problem with combating child sexual slavery. Prosecuting offenders required a victim's testimony, so charges were frequently dropped or never filed. However, in late 2015 Thailand passed a law against the possession of child pornography, allowing digital evidence to speak for the victims. This law also benefits the newly established Thailand Internet Crimes against Children task force (TICAC), supported by the FBI and the US Department of Homeland Security, and designed to share intelligence. Utilising a US model, TICAC combats sexual exploitation facilitated via the internet. For instance, Thai law enforcement officials just started working directly with the US National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children to share real-time information about victims and offenders. Once victims are detected, the next step is providing them with assistance, standard practice for the FBI since 2001. Victim assistance is not just the morally correct course of action: it provides information that helps police more effectively investigate lawbreakers. That increases the chances that abusers will be imprisoned. To maintain the trend in favour of publicly taking a stand against slavery in Thailand, it is necessary to critically examine the status quo. For example, diverse relevant data is available. It can be found within the legal community, among NGOs, and from the victims themselves. But, there are four basic challenges to effectively using this information. First, no standardised data collection format exists. Second, there is no centralised data repository to analyse and disseminate it. Third, organisations may resist sharing data for fear it would give others a funding advantage. Finally, some groups do not appreciate the value of utilising good data. This missed opportunity means many anti-trafficking efforts of various organisations and coalitions are being conducted in isolation. Beyond the larger cities, such as Bangkok, Chiang Mai and Pattaya, which often have coalitions, there is a need for more collaboration to overcome inter-agency differences in perspectives and approaches. Basically, the counter-trafficking community needs to spend more time understanding, analysing, visualising and planning a way forward together. Jointly devising programmes increases efficiency and effectiveness. For example, a programme that addresses the needs of a person from the point at which he or she escapes the exploitation to the time when he or she is settled in a stable living situation is essential. NGO activities need to be linked together to address the needs of a trafficked child. For example, one NGO can offer a shelter to provide healthcare, counselling, and food. A good example of this is Haven Children's Home in Pattaya, funded by the international NGO A21. Once this process is completed, another NGO can offer support to travel with the victim to their home or community, if possible, to attempt to restore a normal life situation. Another NGO could then provide regular follow-up care to identify sustained needs, such as education. This can help to offer an ongoing, personalised support system. The child can then be assisted in countering the vulnerabilities that resulted in his or her being trafficked. If these services are not connected, children might be vulnerable to being re-trafficked. This victim assistance-oriented approach is now taking off. One notable government initiative in Thailand is the recently opened Child Advocacy Centre in Chiang Mai, the first of its type in Southeast Asia. Adapted from US models, the centre provides shelter and resources for victims of child sexual exploitation and abuse. The centre aims to offer ""one-stop care"" for victims, including access to counsellors or lawyers, after-school programmes, and basics such as food. In April, following a bilateral agreement, Thai police generals were among over 100 members of law enforcement and NGOs to receive training from the FBI's Office for Victim Assistance. The Royal Thai Police now aims to allocate victim specialists to every major police force in the country, providing a victim-oriented approach to investigations. This approach both improves the quality of prosecution and better helps victims become involved in seeing that justice is done, as witnesses and as recovering children. The next step is to conduct further FBI co-training of the police's victim-witness coordinators. As we develop best practices in Thailand, we need to propagate this approach throughout Southeast Asia, transforming Thailand into a safe haven for children.

British photographer David Hamilton, known for his widely published nude images of underage girls, was found in a state of cardiac arrest and declared dead an hour later Hamilton, known for his widely published nude images of underage girls, was found in a state of cardiac arrest an informed source said, adding there was medication near his body. He was declared dead an hour later. Hamilton, who rose to fame in the 1970s and whose photography books have sold millions of copies, this week threatened to sue his accusers, saying he had previously been cleared of abuse. The artist, whose work has long raised questions about where art ends and pornography begins, was at the centre of a raft of allegations after a French radio presenter accused him of raping her when she was 13. Flavie Flament, who modelled for Hamilton almost 30 years ago, published an autobiographical novel last month in which she told of being raped by a famous photographer during a shoot. Although she did not name Hamilton in ""The Consolation"", she used his photograph of her as the book's cover. Flament, 42, later told French media that it was Hamilton who had raped her after three other women contacted her with near identical allegations. Flament said Hamilton raped her in the shower of his apartment after spotting her in a nudist resort at Cap d'Agde in southwest France where she was on holiday with her parents. Hamilton confirmed Flament had been his model, but denied the allegations, telling AFP on Tuesday: ""I have done nothing improper."" ""Clearly the instigator of this media lynching is looking for her 15 minutes of fame by defaming me in her novel,"" he said, adding that he would take legal action. Flament's editor Karina Hocine told AFP Friday the radio presenter was ""devastated"" by the news of Hamilton's death. ""Naturally, we feel horrified and, at the same time, really disgusted that there was not enough time for justice to run its course,"" she added. ""The horror of this news will never erase the sleepless nights,"" Flament told AFP, reiterating her allegations. - 'Lost paradise '- Hamilton has said that his work looks for the ""candour of a lost paradise"", and is most famous for his kitschy calendars of young girls and his soft-focus erotic films including ""Bilitis"" from 1977. He was born in London in 1933 and studied architecture as a young man, but it was in Paris where he first started to work in fashion, having moved there aged 20 inspired by the impressionist painters. He first worked as a designer at Elle magazine and then as an artistic director at the luxury Le Printemps department store. With no formal training in photography, he found his calling aged 33, seeking his models in the streets and on the beaches. He became known for his trademark ""Hamilton blur"", his photos often bathed in a very distinctive artistic vagueness. His photos' subdued light, bluish tint and young girls, often blonde, blue-eyed and crowned with flowers, were fashionable in the 70s and 80s but the style became seen as passe in later decades, and his pictures were considered disturbing by some. Under the French statute of limitations, charges must be brought within 20 years for rape and 10 years for sexual abuse. However, in a twist Tuesday, the French minister for children's and women's rights asked Flament to head a body which will look at whether to extend the statute of limitations."

											Edgy film gets axe but soap rapes go on										",https://search.bangkokpost.com/track/visitAndRedirect?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bangkokpost.com%2Fopinion%2Fopinion%2F1143045%2Fedgy-film-gets-axe-but-soap-rapes-go-on&contentId=news1143045,"It is with a frustratingly slow pace that Motel Mist, SEA Write Award-winner Prabda Yoon's debut feature film, starts off and it remains slow until much later on in the film. An elderly man waits in his car for a teenage girl as she leaves school. On board, he slaps her once for swearing to her friend on the phone. Just a little while later, however, anger has suddenly turned into arousal. Eyes on the road, in broad daylight, he starts groping the girl and makes her reach her hand over on to his lap. The man tries to make her use her mouth, but to no avail. That's fine, for they arrive at a trashy love motel soon after. Motel Mist is an okay film. It is a film which people would perhaps have stopped talking about quickly had its scheduled release in cinemas nationwide not been cancelled last week. The irony is that the film had already passed the ill-famed censorship board with an 18-plus rating. It is the film's own investor, cable network TrueVisions, that made the last-minute call, shocking the filmmaker, his team and anticipating fans alike. The film's Facebook page cites ""disagreement between the film-making team and the investor regarding the content of the film"". Kaona Pongpipat is a writer for the Life section, Bangkok Post. This is quite new, considering how the banning of films in the past has always been the purview of the censorship board. Also, it is presumed that the investor was involved with the production of the film from the start and knew all along what they were getting themselves into. First and foremost, the fact remains that we are not really in a position to complain to TrueVisions -- it's their money, their concern and their call. But whether the ban is eventually lifted, an important question has already been raised. As one of the country's biggest entertainment content providers, what is the perception of TrueVisions and its competitors of the Thai audience's maturity? Admittedly, there's a considerable amount of nudity in the film. In the motel room, the man is enchanted by the young female body and embarks upon a voyeuristic sexual ritual. With classical music in the background, and a selection of fantasy costumes and dildos and handcuffs, the man is no less than a carnal connoisseur embarking on a sacred ritual. It's immediately reminiscent of the perverse and seductive Humbert Humbert in novelist Vladimir Nabokov's notorious classic Lolita, and not just in terms of the story. When first published in the mid-1950s, the novel was initially shunned and often described as filth and sheer pornography. It remains controversial until today for its content regarding child abuse. Yet, the book is considered by many as one of the best literary works of the 20th century, and it is considered so not only for Nabokov's exquisite prose but also for his fearlessness in depicting a man's sexual involvement with his stepdaughter. That the book is widely read and valued today is not only testament to Nabokov's literary prowess, but also of readers in an informed, mature society. Motel Mist, a seemingly surreal and mysterious voyeuristic trip on the surface, is essentially a story of sexual abuse and revenge. In fact, it couldn't be more realistic; it's a pressing issue that's as prevalent as ever in society and is often buried out of embarrassment and fear. Last year, research by the Women and Men Progressive Movement Foundation, done by monitoring stories in some 14 newspapers, found that sexual abuse criminal cases had greatly increased from previous years. Over 70% of those sexual abuse incidents were cases of rape, while most of the victims were people under 20 years old. One doesn't know whether to laugh or cry when seeing a film like Motel Mist being pulled while on TV so many soap operas in which the rape culture is openly endorsed are thriving. Male lead characters in these soap operas will ever so often find their way to love by forcing themselves upon women, and live happily ever after. Over the years, such story lines have been revisited, and the idea that masculinity entails power over women has been repeated to the point where such abuse is somehow acceptable. In Motel Mist, it's not simply just bringing the dark side out into the open but also actively exploring the grey area in which consensual prostitution and downright sexual abuse overlap. At the end of the day, it's for the investor to decide whether to insist on keeping the audience's naivety protected or to inform and push the public towards maturity. Whether good or not, Motel Mist is an honest piece of work. At the very least, it should get the chance do what it has come all this way to do."
120,2016-11-22 04:00:00,Someone to listen,https://search.bangkokpost.com/track/visitAndRedirect?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bangkokpost.com%2Flife%2Fsocial-and-lifestyle%2F1141413%2Fsomeone-to-listen&contentId=news1141413,"Lee, Faith and Carmin, assumed names of child victims of sexual exploitation and abuse, not only lost their childhood but were emotionally scarred for life due to this despicable act inflicted on them at the most vulnerable period of their young lives. The three victims have one thing in common -- they opted to remain silent because of fear that no one would understand or believe them if they spoke out. These cases were brought to light by Dorothy Rozga of ECPAT International (End Child Prostitution, Child Pornography and Trafficking of Children for Sexual Purposes), a non-governmental organisation and a global network of civil-society organisations dedicated to ending the commercial sexual exploitation of children, who was a key speaker at last week's Child Helpline International's Eighth International Consultation, a biennial event held in Bangkok. The international gathering brought together government officials, child-protection experts, high-level partners and members of the Child Helpline network from over 100 countries. Participants pooled resources and know-how in the hope of making a sustainable and lasting impact on the lives of children across the globe. Rozga, a supporter of the Bill of Rights for victims of child sexual exploitation and abuse, shared details about Lee's case, saying: ""Currently he is a teacher in Bangkok, but his childhood was a tumultuous one. Lee was repeatedly sexually violated by his caregiver during his childhood. ""And although he knew deep down inside the assault he was subjected to every day was wrong, he couldn't explain why this was happening to him. He didn't have the words to describe or articulate his experience, and his innocence prevented him from realising that he was being victimised. ""Fear paralysed him from expecting outsiders to comprehend what he had gone through. His last resort was to keep quiet."" Rozga then continued with the case study of a girl named Faith who comes from Kenya's capital Nairobi. ""Faith had a similar encounter at age 13. Due to her impoverished background, she was sent to live with a relative who promised to pay for her education,"" she remarked. ""Upon her arrival, however, the teenager was put to work, doing the household chores. Soon she realised she was not going to school. After a few more weeks, she began to get sexually exploited by one of the relatives. ""Faith was eventually rescued from her nightmare, but it took her over a decade to fully comprehend that she had been a victim of child trafficking, exploitation and abuse."" Schoolchildren take part in an activity to educate them about inappropriate touching. Child Helpline Thailand Carmin, a young girl from Honduras, faced a similar fate. She was sent to reside with her uncle in America when she was 13, and eventually sold to a woman who ran a delivery company. ""She was tasked to clean the delivery trucks, while going to school was not an option. Rescued at the age of 17, Carmin spent many years overcoming the shame she felt in confiding that in addition to cleaning the trucks each night she had to sexually service the truck drivers. When she was rescued she had no idea that she had the right to demand justice and to make a case against the people who had owned her for a full four years."" ECPAT International's executive director said questions that arise from these three cases include, why did they suffer in silence for so many years? In her estimation, it is due to fear, shame, stigma and a general lack of knowledge of their rights. Children who are sexually exploited need to know their rights, she said. They need to know their exploitation is a crime and that what is happening to them is not a cause for shame. They need to be told that they are entitled to help, and that they have the right to access justice and need to speak up. ""The lesson from each of the aforementioned cases is that in order to protect children we must provide them with the tools to protect themselves. The bill of rights for child victims of sexual exploitation and abuse is such a tool,"" remarked Rozga. ""Child survivors that participated in the study from Thailand, Tanzania, India, Moldova, Nepal and the Philippines helped us to understand that one of the major barriers to accessing justice was a low level of awareness of their rights. ""After the research was completed, the Bill of Rights was shaped from three rounds of consultations. More than 400 young people, most of them survivors of all forms of atrocities, from 28 countries were involved."" The challenge now, she said, is for the information in the Bill of Rights to reach children. Use the mode that works best for one's community and country, suggested the NGO executive. The information can be shared through radio, television, community committees, websites, social media, music, flash mobs and more. To make her point, she said: ""Child Helpline International tells us that in 2014 alone there were almost 60,000 calls to helplines from children regarding sexual abuse and exploitation. Widely sharing information from this Bill of Rights may cause this number to grow, breaking the silence of young victims further."" Sheila Donovan, executive director of Child Helpline International, said the conference in Bangkok is based on sustainable developmental goals, particularly those having to do with violence against children. One particular goal, Target 16.2, is to end violence against children by 2030. ""To reach this goal, we concentrated on three areas. One is child online protection, keeping children safe in their online world. The second is putting children in a humanitarian setting, especially in the case of emergencies. And the third is gender-related cases. How do you mainstream gender practises in the Child Helpline?"" said Donovan. ""This we accomplished through presentations and workshops. For example, Facebook held a workshop where they trained helpline staff on how to keep children safe online, especially while using social media. We also held workshops, one around gender issues and one around children in emergency situations. Child helpline staff were also given valuable know-how on managing such cases."" Unicef's Cornelius Williams, associate director of the child-protection programme, said that as the fabric of society continues to evolve, parenting and government involvement are critical and becoming increasingly important to ensure children don't become victims of sexual exploitation and abuse. ""Parenting from childhood to the middle years to adolescence is critical for a child's development,"" he said. ""As economies begin to pick up, I would like to suggest governments take a proactive approach toward supporting the family unit. Some areas to look into include early-childhood development, parenting skills, early detection of violence against children, sex education, and, last but not least, explaining to parents that they can discipline their child without being physically or verbally abusive.""

Orangutans, dolphins and pigs are in competition for that honour. Yank author Robert Crais claims dogs. Training hones their natural skills. They have the advantage of hearing that is seven times sharper than man's, not to mention their sharp sense of smell. K-9 turns them into bloodhounds, sniffing out buried bombs and explosives, herding sheep, leading the blind, guarding the owner, protecting families. Their instincts are praiseworthy. The author has a series based on LAPD Detective Scott James and his Alsatian Maggie, an inseparable team. In The Promise, Crais, arguably, overdoes his admiration of the four-legged protagonist. Yet he does it so convincingly as to make her credible. The case is the search for a missing woman. The investigation reveals that she works for a defence contractor and has been blackmailed into supplying explosives Who works with explosives illegally? Terrorists, of course. And, weary of being pursued like rats, they turn on the cat. Scott's car is booby-trapped, detected by his patrol dog. An attack leads to a shoot-out, the leader escaping. Has he fled Los Angeles, or is he still after the detective? Having arrived at the climactic penultimate chapter, there's a violent encounter in a park, Maggie the key combatant. The cop-and-dog team is certain to appeal to readers. Robert Crais made his name penning Hollywood movie scripts and television series.

Come out of the trees and caves and join society. The cost was they had to give up their individuality and live by society's rules. To do so was normal. Not to do so was abnormal, mad, dangerous. Over millennia, the stringent rules were loosened, but not by much. We could have likes and dislikes, as long as they didn't make us a threat to society. One who liked war books and films was considered normal as long as he wasn't a war monger. Ditto one who enjoyed crime thrillers but was law-abiding However, no allowances are made for one liking pornography. He is a dirty so-and-so, a rapist, a psychopath, a monster, a danger to society. Sex offenders, they should all be locked up and the key thrown away. In stories they never defend themselves, tearfully admitting that they are hopeless porno addicts. British author Fiona Barton follows this accepted form in The Widow, labelled a psychological thriller. This genre is the flavour of the decade. Set in London, a child is abducted. Bella is/was the daughter of single mother, a journalist. A blue van is seen in the vicinity, its driver arrested. Glen Taylor is a delivery man, married to Jean. They come across as ordinary. Detective Inspector Bob Sparkes conducts the investigation. There are no other suspects. Despite his protestations of innocence, the DI has a gut feeling he has the right man, the kidnapper. Learning that Glen is into porn, he's convinced of it. Much of the 395-page story is devoted to media and police questioning of Jean -- not least when the case if thrown out for lack of evidence. Glen dies in a road accident. The questioning of the widow continues. Barton ceaselessly treats porn with scorn. The crime is solved in the penultimate chapter. As all right-thinking people abhor it, the protests of its non-rapist supporters are rejected out of hand. As society clearly states, they aren't normal. Who cares what misfits have to say?"

									Re: ""African states demand UN hold Vitit's appointment"" (BP, Nov 6).								 Regarding the article about Prof Vitit Muntabhorn's recent appointment as the first UN independent expert on sexual orientation and gender identity, it needs to be put into context that this is just one of many ""hats"" he has worn for the United Nations. I have known this humble and hard-working legal scholar for 32 years. When I was an exchange student in Thailand in 1984-1985, Prof Vitit allowed us to join as observers for his provincial legal development programme teaching Thais in the countryside about their basic legal rights and the courts. Other UN roles he has held include special rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution, and child pornography and special rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights in North Korea. He has always believed in the mission of the UN and been willing to help them out from their regional base in Bangkok where many commissions such as UNDP and UNESCAP are headquartered. Article 7 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights provides ""All are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the law. All are entitled to equal protection against any discrimination in violation of this Declaration and against any incitement to such discrimination."" LGBT rights is just one of a long list of legal issues that Prof Vitit has been an expert on. Prof Vitit graduated with first class honours from Oxford, is balanced, and listens to all constituencies. He is thoughtful and considerate. I am sure if they meet him all UN member states will realise the positive contribution that he will make. Andrew DelaneySingapore Re: ""PM speeds up help for rice farmers"" (BP, Nov 6). Coming from a farming background, I have every sympathy for the farming family, yet harbour great concern regarding programmes where the government steps in and essentially starts meddling in the operation of the free market. Having authorities mop up excess supply every time the price of paddy drops below a certain threshold does nothing to solve long term excesses. In fact, it encourages future excesses. Farmers are in effect being told: ""If rice prices are high, you get to keep all of the excess profits. If prices are low we will step in and backstop prices. In other words, heads you win and tails you don't lose (much)."" This is what economists term ""moral hazard"" and this asymmetry of risks and rewards is at the root of much of the financial rot that the world has experienced in recent years. Rice pledging has proven to be an addictive quick fix in the past, and the end result is a potential massive misallocation of the already-stretched resources of the farmer, to speak nothing of the burdens placed upon the country's finances. I would hope that a better solution could be found to support farmers, while at the same time neither distorting the market nor saddling the nation with considerable additional debt. Maxwell Brock Re: ""A real tear jerker"" (Letters, Nov 6).

											What's in a name?										",https://search.bangkokpost.com/track/visitAndRedirect?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bangkokpost.com%2Fthailand%2Fspecial-reports%2F1125065%2Fwhats-in-a-name-&contentId=news1125065,"For ""smooth cultural integration"", Thai international study agency Smart NZ Education advises that students with nicknames like Poo, Pee and Porn consider alternatives. The issue made headlines earlier last month after a report by the New Zealand Herald indicated that students might get ""harassed if nothing is done"". That's not unlikely, despite the fact that ""faeces"", ""urine"" and ""pornography"" -- the formal English words for the aforementioned nicknames -- weren't exactly those parents' intention when their children first came into the world. The incident is in fact just another example of a long-standing point for light-hearted jokes, social awkwardness or even downright offence to English-speaking foreigners in Thailand. All this results from some unfortunate cases of homophonics. Those examples are just a few among many popular Thai names that end with ""porn"" and ""chit"", and there are also odd nicknames (to non-Thais) like Moo (pig), Nok (bird), Gop (frog) or Chang (elephant), and we haven't even ventured outside the animal category. The idiosyncrasy of Thai names, however, is much more complex than that. Their evolution dates back to the Sukhothai era, when names were simply meant to mark order among relatives, and to the time of Field Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram, when gender-based naming was introduced. Now naming relies heavily on astrological belief and keeping up with the fashion. Life talked with Asst Prof Somchai Sumniengngam, of Silpakorn University's Faculty of Arts, who has researched and written extensively on the subject, in an attempt to unravel the beauty and oddness of Thai names. Assigning order and fending off ghosts In the Sukhothai era, names of ordinary people were rarely written down in official records, but it is known that names were just a means of giving order to the children in the family. For example, names like Ai, Yee and Sam for the first, second and third child, respectively, according to the words' meanings in Thai. There was also Ram, meaning ""beautiful"", to reflect the spirit of a time when the city was being greatly developed. ""In the Ayutthaya and early Rattanakosin eras,"" explained Somchai, ""people were starting to be named according to their physical attributes, like Daeng [red], Dum [black] and Gon [chunk], or after objects in everyday life like fruits or trees."" Odd names, some of which we still have today, like Aueng (bullfrog), Kiad (a small frog), Mha (dog) or Moo (pig) result from a Thai belief that babies are born from ghosts, with such unpleasant names meant to fool and discourage spirits from taking back the babies. Good blessing and class The early Rattanakosin era saw people opting for names with auspicious and favourable meanings like Thong (gold) and Ngern (silver), or Boon (merits). All the while, names had always been monosyllabic until they started to clash. There were so many Boons, Thongs and Ngerns that eventually names like Boonmee and Boonma started to come along, presumably as shortened forms of ""Boon who is the son of Mee"" and ""Boon who is the son of Ma"". By the Rattanakosin era, the influence of the Pali and Sanskrit languages had been around for quite some time. Names of kings and other royals since late Sukhothai and Ayutthaya were long and grand, through these languages' words and word combinations. In early stages, ordinary people avoided these out of respect and modesty. In the Rattanakosin era, however, the educated started to take up those languages when coming up with names. ""After the Siamese Revolution of 1932, we saw people of the lower and middle classes start opting for longer names, in an attempt to achieve a sense of equality among people of higher classes,"" said Somchai. ""In terms of names and class, research has found that students from well-known private schools tend to have longer names than those from state schools."" Somchai explained that after a while, this trend was starting to shift. Lower- and middle-class people started to go for longer names while those in the upper class, in an attempt to shift away from that, went back to monosyllables. It is expected that this trend will shift continually. Astrology and gender-based naming One of the most pivotal factors in the evolution of Thai names are the astrological principles introduced by King Rama IV or King Mongkut. Well-versed in the subject, the King would name his children through Namtaksapakorn, an ancient scripture that illustrates the principles of naming through astrological belief. The tradition is as strong as ever, as people still consult this scripture. Using birth date as the basis, the book suggested what alphabet letters to use for the names of newborns, or what to avoid if some letters for particular days are bad luck. For people born on Monday, for instance, vowels are not recommended because, if that's person's career is going well, their family affairs will go wrong, or the other way around. ""My theory is that people resort to this type of method because they just need something to rely on,"" said Somchai. ""Life is uncertain, and what we can turn to is something invisible. The tradition of naming for good meaning has long been there. And then there's astrology. Now, some people would even change the spelling of their names because some believe each alphabet has a particular level of strength, measured by numbers. Changing the spelling would get them the desired number, after adding up all the letters in the name."" Five years ago, 26-year-old Siwat Ananthammachai, along with his parents and sister, changed not only their first names but their last name. He said that at the time there wasn't anything wrong with their lives, but some said their names were bad luck and the family was just no longer happy with the old names. ""It's like moving to a new house or changing your car,"" said Siwat. ""This is not to say that I rely on this kind of belief completely. Did life become better after? I can't answer that. Perhaps I just felt better when people started calling me by my new name."" Another defining factor for the evolution of Thai names came with the cultural revolution during the government of Field Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram, with its attempt to civilise the nation. From this period on, people started to adopt names suggestive of gender -- for example, names ending with ""-chai"", ""-sak"" and ""-yot"" are for males, while those with ""-porn"" or ""-sri"" are for females. Present-day creativity No one could have foreseen what would follow the tradition that began during Sukhothai merely as a means of marking order among relatives. Names like Moo and Nok still exist, but they are used as nicknames and not favoured by newer generations. There's no one theory that can explain the types of names and nicknames we come across these days. The nicknames take the form of such monikers as Man U, Liverpool, Uefa, Perfect, Ben 10, One-Man-Show, Nuclear, Internet, Google and Big Mac. Thirty-nine-year-old Tridate Sribhanasakulchai's nickname, for instance, is Porsche, and his two children's are Bugatti and Lamborghini. But this tradition goes a bit farther back. Tridate's older brothers' nicknames are Benz and Alfa (from Alfa Romeo), and their children's nicknames, naturally, include Martin (from Aston Martin), Ferrari and Mati (from Maserati). ""It's something that connects us more than ordinary siblings' names,"" said Tridate. ""It's something that makes us feel united and it's a tradition that can go on until our grandchildren's generation."" For names, the trend doesn't just stop at the principles of Namtaksapakorn. Somchai said that some people will even go for how it looks when written down, even if the words when put together seem to have no meaning. One great example is a name like Raranrorn, which in Thai is written with six similar letters together -- making it look very striking visually but giving it no particular meaning."

Launched some 11 years ago, the largely publicly funded project by Berlin's top university hospital Charite calls on paedophiles to undertake a treatment that helps them control their urges. More than 7,000 people have sought information on the programme which is offered in 11 centres across Germany.  Of these, 659 people have undertaken the therapy, with 251 completing the entire programme. Another 265 are currently being given treatment either in group or individual sessions. The German initiative is unique because it deals with potential sex criminals, or those who have already committed abuses but have managed to escape justice. Other programmes deal with convicted paedophiles who have also been issued specific orders to seek medical care. Klaus Beier, who leads the prevention network as well as Charite's sexual medicine institute, has no illusions about the programme. ""Paedophilia is not curable,"" he said.  ""But it can be treated,"" he added, stressing that ""a paedophile can learn to control his urges."" - Treating urge to prevent crime - The project is grounded on the principle that sexual attraction to children is a medical problem, and as Beier said, ""not a crime"" until the urge is acted upon.  The World Health Organization too classifies paedophilia as a ""sexual preference disorder"". Over one or two years, during two-hour sessions every week, the patient is taught to develop strategies to stop himself from acting on his tendencies or from consuming child pornography. The programme also helps the patient to acquire a level of empathy towards potential victims, which could go towards dissuading him from hurting them. The patient can choose to remain anonymous throughout the treatment, even with his therapist, and at the end of the programme, he can request follow-ups. Medical help, such as chemical castration, is also offered on a voluntary basis.  Scientists from around the world including countries in North America as well as Switzerland and India, have been watching the project with interest. ""In France, we are still at the starting point on creating a programme that is similar to Germany's,"" said a psychiatrist at France's health and medical research institute Inserm, Serge Stoleru. He said the response from authorities had been that ""paedophilia is a tricky subject."" But even in Germany, one of the countries scarred by a massive paedophile priest scandal in the Roman Catholic Church, the therapy programme is controversial. Not only is there strong societal pressure against the programme, Beier said that even in the pharmaceutical world, there is ""great reticence"" towards developing medicine for paedophiles that could take effect rapidly. However, Jerome Braun, who leads a child protection foundation called Hansel and Gretel that co-funds the therapy programme, said that prevention work must not only be targeted at bringing awareness to potential victims in kindergartens or schools. ""It should also look at potential criminals because each act prevented is a child saved,"" he said."

Mr Vitit, an international law professor at Chulalongkorn University who has had several previous roles in the United Nations, was involved in the initial steps to adopt the Yogyakarta Principles. He said yesterday that support for him had come from a wide range of people and groups, including governments, civil society and the UN. Rights fighter: Vitit Muntarbhorn ""I look forward to bridge-building with stakeholders and communities globally to counter violence and prejudice so that people will be respected and protected in the spirit of human rights and sexual diversity, and under the umbrella of international law,"" he told the Bangkok Post Sunday. ""I will issue a more detailed statement concerning my mandate later when I go to the UN in Geneva to undertake this pro bono work."" Mr Vitit has served on several UN bodies, including inquiries on Syria and as a special rapporteur on North Korea and child prostitution and pornography. He co-chaired the 2006 meeting that led to the Yogyakarta Principles, a set of recommendations on applying international human rights law to fight discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI). Paisarn Likhitpreechakul of the Foundation for SOGI Rights and Justice, a Thai LGBT advocacy group, said he thought the appointment would draw attention to actual rather than perceived situations of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) Thais who face challenges in many areas of life. ""I hope it will also strengthen the human rights culture in Thailand, not only in terms of sexual orientation and gender identity, but also civil, political, social and economic rights which continue to be under threat today,"" Mr Paisarn said. National Human Rights commissioner Angkhana Neelapaijit said she was delighted to see Mr Vitit given the international position. ""The UN Human Rights Council has appointed the right person because Mr Vitit is one person who really knows and understands all dimensions of LGBTI. And he is a widely recognised law professor by both state and civil society sectors,"" Ms Angkhana said. She said the appointment of Mr Vitit will encourage positive change and social acceptance of LGBTI people in Thailand and around the world. Ty Cobb, director of Human Rights Campaign Global, was quoted on washingtonblade.com as saying Mr Vitit's appointment was ""a huge step forward for LGBTI human rights worldwide"". The UN agreed on the new role in June after the 47-member rights council overcame strong objections by Saudi Arabia and other Muslim countries. Human Rights Watch welcomed Friday's appointment, saying the UN council ""made history"". ""This critical mandate will bring much-needed attention to human rights violations against LGBT people in all regions of the world,"" John Fisher, the group's director in Geneva, said in a statement. The International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association said the newly created role was critical to give justice to LGBTI people."

An active social media user, Solberg defied Facebook early Friday by posting the photograph, helping to bring the weeks-long controversy to a head. But it was deleted a few hours later by Facebook, in what is believed to be a first such online censorship involving a government leader. By Saturday morning the post was restored on the Norwegian premier's Facebook page.

The picture from 1972, which went on to win the Pulitzer Prize for spot news photography, has been used countless times to illustrate the horrors of modern warfare. But for Facebook, the image of the girl, Phan Thi Kim Phuc, was one that violated its standards about nudity on the social network. So after a Norwegian author posted images about the terror of war with the photo to Facebook, the company removed it. The movehen a Norwegian newspaper, Aftenposten, cried foul over the takedown of the picture, thousands of people globally responded Friday with an act of virtual civil disobedience by posting the image of Phuc on their Facebook pages and, in some cases, daring the company to act. Hours after the pushback, Facebook reinstated the photo across its site. ""An image of a naked child would normally be presumed to violate our community standards, and in some countries might even qualify as child pornography,"" Facebook said in a statement Friday. ""In this case, we recognise the history and global importance of this image in documenting a particular moment in time."" The reversal underscores Facebook’s increasingly tricky position as an arbiter of mass media. While the social network has resisted being labelled a media entity -- its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, recently told a group of Italian university students that Facebook is a ""tech company, not a media company"" -- many used the Vietnam War photo uproar to call upon the Silicon Valley behemoth to acknowledge its control over the articles, videos and images that people consume. ""Mark Zuckerberg can resist the definition all he wants, claiming Facebook is a white-hot tech company, not a media company,"" said Emily Bell, director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University. ""But it is now possible for a company to be both."" In an open letter to Mr Zuckerberg, Espen Egil Hansen, editor-in-chief of Aftenposten, said Facebook played a dominant role in how people around the world view information and that it should not set limits on what types of journalism could be seen online. ""Mark Zuckerberg is the most powerful editor-in-chief in the world,"" Mr Hansen, whose newspaper has a print circulation of 200,000, said in an interview Friday. ""Tomorrow, there will be another photo. Facebook will have to respond to that."" Ms Phuc did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Nick Ut, the photographer who took the iconic image for The Associated Press, was travelling; the news agency said it was ""proud of the photo"". ""We are always looking to improve our policies to make sure they both promote free expression and keep our community safe, and we will be engaging with publishers and other members of our global community on these important questions going forward,"" a Facebook spokeswoman said. The frequency with which Facebook needs to respond to questions over its media role has increased over the past 18 months. In May, the company had to grapple with reports that some editors working on its ""Trending Topics"" section -- a portion of the site in which Facebook displays some of the most-talked-about stories on the network -- were suppressing conservative political content. Facebook last month laid off the Trending Topics team and said it would rely solely on algorithmic decision-making to surface trending stories across the site. In the weeks since, some have called for Facebook to rethink that stance, as several fake news stories have more prominently appeared in the section. Last year, Facebook also had to revise its community standards after photos of women breast-feeding were removed from their Facebook pages. And the company apologised in May after it blocked a photo of a plus-size model for being ""undesirable"". Facebook’s editorial influence reaches far beyond Trending Topics. The company, with 1.71 billion members worldwide, is continuously refining and updating the algorithms that control the News Feed, the stream of status updates, news articles, photos and videos that most of its users spend the most time interacting with. Those changes affect the type of content people see more frequently -- photos from friends and family, for instance, instead of news stories -- which can have an effect on what people are sharing across the network. Many of the world’s largest publishers, from The New York Times and The Guardian to Vice and BuzzFeed, also increasingly rely on Facebook to communicate with the social network’s users. A growing number of media companies and analysts have raised concerns that Facebook may hold too much sway over how information is distributed. Almost half of American adults rely on Facebook as a source of news, according to a study by the Pew Research Center. The commotion over the photo of Ms Phuc, also known as the Napalm Girl picture, began when Tom Egeland, a Norwegian author, wrote a Facebook post in August that included seven photographs about the history of warfare. One of those was the image of Ms Phuc, which was then removed by Facebook, citing its standards policy. Facebook uses a combination of algorithms and human moderators to review photos that can potentially break its rules. In this case, the photo was tagged for removal by one of Facebook’s algorithms, which was then followed up by a human editor, according to a person at the company who spoke on the condition of anonymity because she was not authorised to speak publicly. After Mr Egeland criticised the removal of his post, he was barred from posting on Facebook for 24 hours. On Wednesday, after he republished the photo on his Facebook page, Mr Egeland said he had been barred from Facebook for another three days. Mr Hansen of Aftenposten, taking a stand on behalf of Mr Egeland, asked his journalists to report on the author’s case this week and also posted the Vietnam War photo on the newspaper’s own Facebook page. Mr Hansen said he received an email Wednesday from the social network requesting that the image be taken down. Before he could respond, he said Facebook removed the newspaper’s post without asking permission. On Friday, Norway’s prime minister, Erna Solberg, and cabinet ministers also posted the Vietnam War photo on their Facebook pages in a show of solidarity. ""Facebook gets it wrong when they censor such images,"" Ms Solberg wrote in her post. Yet soon after Ms Solberg published that Facebook post, the social network also removed it, citing the company’s standards policy. When the picture’s takedown went viral, the photo went into wide circulation on the social network, including on the Facebook page of Ut, the photographer. Facebook later said it would take some time for the photo and posts that contained it to reappear across the site, perhaps as much as a few days. Mr Egeland, the Norwegian author whose Facebook post kicked off the global protest, said the company’s reversal underlined how people can come together to force a tech giant to change its ways -- even though he could still not post on his own Facebook page until his three-day exile expired. ""I hope that Facebook realised that this was a mistake,"" he said in an interview. ""I would love to go online right now and publish, 'We won!'"""

""An image of a naked child would normally be presumed to violate our Community Standards, and in some countries might even qualify as child pornography."" But Facebook said it was allowing the picture to be posted on the world's largest social network and will ""adjust our review mechanisms to permit sharing of the image going forward.""

Erna Solberg’s post was the latest development in a row over photographer Nick Ut’s Pulitzer Prize winning picture of a naked Vietnamese girl, Phan Thi Kim Phuc, running down a road after being injured in a napalm attack on her village in 1972. The controversy started as Facebook removed the ""Napalm Girl"" picture from thriller writer Tom Egeland’s profile because of its rules on nudity. The Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten then published the picture on its Facebook page, which was also censored. The newspaper on Friday published an open letter to Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg to protest against the action. “I appreciate the work of Facebook and other media to stop pictures and content showing abuse and violence,” Solberg said in a comment she posted with the picture. “But Facebook gets it wrong when it censors pictures like these. It contributes to restricting the freedom of speech.” A little more than three hours after Solberg posted the picture on Friday morning, it was also removed -- by Facebook, according to Solberg. The prime minister responded by re-posting a blacked-out version of that picture and several other iconic photographs, such as the “Saigon Execution” and that of the unknown protester who stopped Chinese tanks after the Tiananmen Square repression in 1989. “What Facebook does by removing images of this kind, good as the intentions may be, is to edit our common history,” she wrote. “I hope that Facebook uses this opportunity to review its editing policy, and assumes the responsibility a large company that manages a broad communication platform should take.” Facebook is facing criticism over its regulation of content as it aims to find a universal standard to apply to its 1.7 billion monthly users, and bans on pornography prevent posting art or historic photographs such as the one at the heart of the controversy in Norway. Facebook said it was seeking to strike a balance between enabling free speech and “maintaining a safe and respectful experience for our global community"". “While we recognise that this photo is iconic, it’s difficult to create a distinction between allowing a photograph of a nude child in one instance and not others,” an unidentified Facebook spokesperson said in an e-mailed comment. “Our solutions won’t always be perfect, but we will continue to try to improve our policies and the ways in which we apply them.”"

There was the mother who had beaten breast and bone cancer on two separate occasions, and who was out dancing with her gay son. The son survived; she was killed. There were a couple of female bartenders and bouncers but the vast majority were men, young and good looking and full of life. And gay. Today's column is another list of homosexuals. It's such a long list, too long for a single page of Brunch, so it will be selective and feature just the main identities with the understanding there are dozens, if not hundreds of others. We start with Troy King, a prominent anti-homosexual Republican Alabama Attorney-General. His public stand on sex toys was to ban them outright, but he didn't stop at that. He pushed for a ban on homosexuality and had quite a lot of support in his state, until his wife found him in bed with a male college student. There is Paul Crouch, president and founder of the Trinity Broadcasting Network, the world's largest religious network. Crouch was instrumental in pushing TBN's anti-gay stance. He was also pushing TBN employee Enoch Ford to have sex with him, threatening him with the sack if he didn't. And so they did. Crouch ended up paying Ford $425,000 to shut him up -- which Ford didn't. Up next is former US Senator Larry Craig, a strong anti-gay-marriage voice who twice voted against adding the words ""sexual orientation"" to laws about hate crimes. That made him the darling of the American Family Association -- until he tried to pick up an undercover cop in the men's toilets at Minneapolis International Airport. The ageing homosexual admitted his guilt and paid a fine, then sensing political oblivion reversed his stance. Speaking of stances, he explained his cubicle behaviour as being the result of ""having a wide stance"". Larry went on to become an adviser for Mitt Romney's presidential campaign, which kind of ended the same way as the airport incident. Next homosexual on the list is Ted Haggard. He was a reverend, the leader of the National Association of Evangelicals, meeting the then president George W Bush weekly for spiritual advice. He gave electrifying speeches, often to children, with a focus on the disgusting sin of homosexuality. His speech calendar was severely curtailed when it was discovered he was snorting crystal meth while paying male prostitutes to have sadomasochistic sex with him. Speaking of religious types, we must now move on to Bishop Eddie Long who incessantly reiterated the sin of homosexuality as laid out by the Bible and God. He claimed to be able to cure gays and lesbians. The black bishop, alas, never administered that cure on himself, for while he was incessantly reiterating in public, he was incessantly banging four different men. One final religious type -- Baptist minister George Rekers, a bigwig on the National Association For Research And Therapy Of Homosexuality (or CLOSET for short). He was an advocate for banning adoption by gays. In fact he despised everything that was gay, with the exception of the cute rent boy he quietly took away on an island holiday, whom he picked up from a gay hookup site after Rekers described himself as ""sensual, wild and up for anything"". We must farewell men of the homosexual cloth on our list, since there are estimates that up to 58% of all Catholic priests are either gay or paedophiles and thus would take up way too much space. Let's conclude our list with obese Republican county commissioner Bruce Barclay of Pennsylvania. He stood for Christianity and family values and said he absolutely could not swallow homosexuality -- although in the privacy of his bedroom, his stance on swallowing was decidedly different. He videotaped himself having sex with more than 100 male prostitutes. That's like the entire contents of three gay bars on Soi Twilight. There are so many others on our list, like US Republican Congressman Mark Foley who was staunchly anti-child pornography, while sending sexually explicit SMS messages to teenage boys saying things like ""get a ruler and measure it for me."" That one is more paedophilia that homosexual, but apparently Mark was happy with a male of any age, though length was clearly important. Or British MP Jerry Hayes who voted for anti-gay legislation despite having an affair with an 18-year-old man. Or Republican congressman Edward Shrock who hated the idea of gays in the military, but didn't hate the idea of gays in his own bed. Or Republican Senate candidate Steve Wiles who this year took a hard stand against gay marriage, despite working in the past as a drag queen under the name Miss Mona Sinclair. Why so many homosexuals in the Republican Party? Last Sunday another name was added to the list. A 29-year-old homosexual walked into a gay bar he frequented regularly with a semi-automatic rifle, and mowed down those 49 men and women, in an act of self-loathing the likes we have never seen before. He cited religion and a terrorist group as his reasons for his actions. Don't believe the Isis part for a minute. As for religion? In a way, yes. He was an unbalanced screwball who grew up in a society that practised Islam, a religion that despises gays, much like Christianity does. Both religions make it clear that homosexuality is evil and punishable by death. The Vatican, run by ageing bachelors in flamboyant dresses, invokes a Catechism that states that ""homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered"" and that ""under no circumstances can they be approved"". If you are a willing scholar of that doctrine, it doesn't take many steps from that to genocide. (Last Monday Pastor Roger Jiminez of Sacramento rejoiced in the Orlando massacre. Texas Deputy Governor Dan Patrick quoted the New Testament about reaping what you sow. Don't you just know they both have profiles on Jack'd or Grindr?) How awful for any homosexual child growing up in 2016 to have to conform to edicts set out by unenlightened desert warriors of the Middle East of up to 2,000 years ago. What can these children in strict religious families do? Many of them take the sensible road and flee their religion but at a terrible price, since it also entails fleeing their families. Many repress their feelings, which must be unnatural, unbearable and unhealthy. Unbalanced children grow into unbalanced embittered and sometimes violent adults. After all, they have to channel their energy somewhere. Some grow up to be gay-hating Republican Congressmen, while others turn to the priesthood, while others get married and scream their hatred of gays for all the world to hear. This seems to be the rule for the most vocal anti-gay activists -- they protesteth too much. And some turn to arms. What can be done about this terrible society of ours -- which fosters self-loathing, hatred and terrorism in the name of gods in the sky -- other than the dismantlement of organised religion? That's not going to happen anytime soon, so while we continue to have churches and mosques, homosexual children are going to be singled out, abused and repressed. And some will continue to explode. Don't be surprised if more of these atrocities occur. It is natural that they do while we continue to preach the philosophy of hate and segregation. These are bleak times not just for gods, but for humanity. What can save us? It sure isn't religion. n"

A new software tool aims to help online firms quickly find and eliminate extremist content used to spread and incite violence and attacks	 The Counter Extremism Project, a nongovernment group based in Washington, proposed its software be used in a system similar to one used to prevent the spread on online child pornography. The software was developed by Dartmouth University computer scientist Hany Farid, who also worked on the PhotoDNA system which is now widely used by Internet companies to stop the spread of content showing sexual exploitation or pornography involving children. The announcement comes amid growing concerns about radical jihadists using social networks to diffuse violent and gruesome content and recruit people for attacks. ""We think this is the technological solution to combat online extremism,"" said Mark Wallace, chief executive of the organization that includes former diplomats and public officials from the United States and other countries. The group proposed the creation of an independent ""National Office for Reporting Extremism"" that would operate in a similar fashion to the child pornography center -- identifying and flagging certain content to enable online firms to automatically remove it. This system, if adopted by Internet firms, ""would go a long way to making sure than online extremist is no longer pervasive,"" Wallace told a conference call with journalists. He said it could be useful in stopping the ""viral"" spread of videos of beheadings and killings such as those produced by the Islamic State (IS) organization. Wallace said he expects ""robust debate"" on what is acceptable content but added that ""I think we could agree that the beheading videos, the drowning videos, the torture videos... should be removed."" - 'Collaborative discussions' - Wallace said the group has had ""collaborative discussions"" with Internet firms and that ""there has been a lot of interest."" But he added that it would be up to each online operator to determine whether to use the software and how to implement it. Farid, who also spoke on the call, said he believes the new system would be an effective tool for companies which must now manually review each complaint on objectionable content. ""We are simply developing a technology that allows companies to accurately and effectively enforce their terms of service,"" Farid said. ""They do it anyway, but it's slow."" The system is based on ""robust hashing"" or finding so-called digital signatures of content of text, images, audio and video that can be tracked to enable platforms to identify and stop content from being posted or reposted. ""The technology has been developed, it has been tested and we are in the final stages of engineering to get it ready for deployment,"" Farid said. ""We're talking about a matter of months."" Social networks have long stressed they will help legitimate investigations of crimes and attacks, but have resisted efforts to police or censor the vast amounts content flowing through them. Farid said he developed the software with a grant from Microsoft, and that he and the Counter Extremism Project would work to provide it to online companies. "

											Live-streaming of attacks a challenge for social media										",https://search.bangkokpost.com/track/visitAndRedirect?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bangkokpost.com%2Fworld%2F1011761%2Flive-streaming-of-attacks-a-challenge-for-social-media&contentId=news1011761,"WASHINGTON - As more gruesome crimes and attacks show up on live online video, social media platforms are facing new challenges on preventing the spread of gruesome and horrific content. Platforms like Facebook and Twitter have been promoting their new live video features, but are struggling to find ways to keep out content that promotes violence	 The challenge was underscored in Monday's deadly attack on a policeman and his wife in France in which the killer posted on Facebook a live 13-minute video of himself with the victim's child in which he admitted the murders and urged fellow jihadists to carry out more bloodshed. Platforms like Facebook and Twitter have been promoting their new live video features, but are struggling to find ways to keep out content that promotes violence. ""Terrorists and acts of terrorism have no place on Facebook,"" a spokeswoman for the leading social network said when asked about the incident in France. ""Whenever terrorist content is reported to us, we remove it as quickly as possible. We treat takedown requests by law enforcement with the highest urgency."" The Facebook statement acknowledged ""unique challenges"" for live-streamed videos, adding, ""it's a serious responsibility, and we work hard to strike the right balance between enabling expression while providing a safe and respectful experience."" Twitter, whose Periscope live video feature has been used to show a suicide in France and a rape in the United States, offered a similar policy. A Twitter spokesman queried by AFP reiterated its policy stating that ""you may not make threats of violence or promote violence, including threatening or promoting terrorism."" Periscope, according to its policy statement, ""is intended to be open and safe"" and ""explicit graphic content is not allowed"" including ""depictions of child abuse, animal abuse, or bodily harm."" - Technology solutions - Social networks have long stressed they will help legitimate investigations of crimes and attacks, but have resisted efforts to police or censor the vast amounts content flowing through them. But social media groups are capable of doing more to prevent and remove horrific content from being streamed worldwide, said Mark Wallace, chief executive of the Counter Extremism Project, a group founded by former diplomats from the United States and other countries to work against extremist ideology. Wallace said social networks have already implemented systems that filter child pornography, and could do the same for other violent acts. ""There is technology to do that now,"" he told AFP. ""It's a question of will, not technology."" This kind of filtering, Wallace said, would help dissuade the use of these platforms by those seeking to attack the United States or its allies. ""We have to get to place where if I'm a terrorist, I know that my video isn't going to go all over the world."" Gabriel Weimann, a professor of communication at the University of Haifa in Israel and author of a book ""Terrorism in Cyberspace,"" agreed on a need to do more. ""For the terrorist himself, (live video) is an instrument for self-glorification, for eternal reward, for presenting himself and his cause to the world,"" Weimann told AFP. Weimann called for ""better cooperation between these media (Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter and more) and the counter-terrorism agencies."" ""There is no perfect solution, no way to seal the Internet. But there are better ways to minimized terrorist abuse of these platforms,"" he said. - Free speech issues - Civil liberties activists question however whether the government should be pressuring social networks to limit content that could be protected under the US constitution, and its free speech guarantees. Social networks ""are concerned about not trampling on the contractual rights of their users or acting on behalf of the government to take away people's constitutional rights,"" said Sophia Cope, an attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. ""They don't want to be investigatory arms of the government or have their business model be overshadowed by another realm of responsibility. That's not to say they can't cooperate when they have the means to do so."" She said civil liberties defenders are concerned about government mandates, such as one proposal that would require social media firms to report terrorist activity. Hugh Handeyside, an attorney in the American Civil Liberties Union's National Security Project, said it's too soon to know what may be done on live-streaming of violent acts, but that social networks should not be used by government for back-door censorship. Deciding on what is related to terrorism ""is a question experts have difficulty making, and will inevitably be subjective and context-dependent,"" according to Handeyside. ""We object to the government systematically using these content-flagging mechanisms. If the government is identifying speech it deems offensive but couldn't ban outright and is attempting to leverage these companies' terms of service, that amounts to censorship."""

Authorities identified the suspect as Stephen Kim Le Cornu, a retired foreigner living in Thailand. Mr Cornu was apprehended Tuesday at his home in a housing estate, Sinthorn, on Happy Land Road in Bangkok's Bang Kapi district. The arrest was conducted by a joint force from the Department of Special Investigation (DSI), the Technology Crime Suppression Division, the Anti-Human Trafficking Division and Australian authorities. The probe was launched after Thai authorities received a tip-off from foreign officials that content concerning child molestation was posted by the Australian man on overseas websites. Police later sought a search warrant as well as an arrest warrant for Mr Cornu from the court. Pol Capt Kemmachart Prakaihongmanee, deputy director of the DSI's Bureau of Foreign Affairs and Transnational Crime, said officers had now examined Mr Cornu's computer and mobile phone. He said messages related to performing obscene acts with children were also found. Authorities, however, have yet to discover evidence that proved the suspect has committed child molestation. While being questioned, police say Mr Cornu admitted writing those messages and posting them on foreign websites. His act violates Section 187 of the Criminal Code which bans the production of child pornography. Mr Cornu has also been charged with possession of child pornography and production of obscene material in violation of the Computer Crime Act. He could face a prison term of up to five years or a fine of 100,000 baht."

France's Dimitri Payet (C) shoots to score past Romania's Ovidiu Hoban (L) and Mihai Pintilii during their Euro 2016 group A match	 In a packed Stade de France surrounded by thousands of police guarding against a repeat of the Novermber 13 attacks on Paris, coach Didier Deschamps said a nation's expectations had weighed heavily. ""The players felt it and that imposes obligations. Psychologically it was not easy to manage but we were rewarded"" with the win, he said. Germany, Spain, Italy, England and other rivals for the European title cannot have failed to notice France's frailties in defence and Payet's inspirational performance. After a nervous start against a Romanian team with nothing to lose, the 29-year-old Payet, who only broke into the France team this year, provided the cross for Olivier Giroud to head France into the lead in the 57th minute. Romania had defended stubbornly. Bogdan Stancu equalised from the penalty spot after a clumsy foul from Patrice Evra on Nicolae Stanciu. Payet then had to step in with a bending 25 metre strike in the 89th minute that brought tears even to the scorer as he left the field. ""It was a lot of stress, a lot of pressure, if someone had told me it would have gone like that I don't think I would have believed them,"" said Payet. ""It was that emotion that came out in the goal,"" added the 29-yeear-old who has had a stunning season with West Ham United in the English Premier League. Deschamps, bidding to repeat France's triumphs at Euro '84 and the 1998 World Cup on home soil, was relieved to get a win that put France top of Group A with matches against Switzerland and Albania to come. ""We struggled to get out the blocks but the reward was at the end. It's a very good thing to have won the first match, to start us off in the competition,"" he said. - Trouble in Marseille - Some 90,000 police and security guards are protecting the 10 stadiums and surrounding fan zones during the month-long 24 nation contest. The government and even top players fear a repeat of the Paris attacks in which 130 people died last November.  But the first violence erupted in Marseille where England fans fought Russian rivals and police for a second day amid clouds of tear gas. Riot police had to separate English and Russian supporters. Officials said seven arrests were made and the riot squad spent the rest of night watching hundreds of beer sodden fans. England's match against Russia and Gareth Bale's Wales' match with Slovakia in their first appearance at a Euro finals are the highlights of Saturday. All four teams are in Group B.  England's prolific new strike partnership of Premier League top-scorer Harry Kane and Leicester City title-winning hero Jamie Vardy will hope to outgun Russia. Wales will be counting on Real Madrid forward Bale for goals against a tricky Slovenia side in their opener. In the day's third match, brothers Granit and Taulant Xhaka will clash -- one playing for Switzerland and the othere for Albania. Meanwhile, Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea appeared at a Spanish team press conference to dismiss reports that he had organised a party where women were allegedly forced to have sex against their will. ""I am the first one to be surprised by this report. I deny it, it is false and nothing more, it is a lie and false,"" De Gea said. Eldiario.es news website said the name of De Gea and Athletic Bilbao's Iker Muniain appeared in the testimony of a ""protected witness"" as part of an investigation into Ignacio Allende, a Spanish porn producer who was detained in April for alleged sexual abuse of minors and spreading child pornography. The witness reportedly said she and another woman were forced to participate in a party in 2012 organised by De Gea, in which they both had sex with footballers. On Sunday, world champions Germany open their campaign against Ukraine, and Bayern Munich's Polish striker Robert Lewandowski will aim to spoil Northern Ireland's first ever appearance in the Euro finals."

											Home truths hidden in child sex abuse										",https://search.bangkokpost.com/track/visitAndRedirect?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bangkokpost.com%2Fopinion%2Fopinion%2F973329%2Fhome-truths-hidden-in-child-sex-abuse&contentId=news973329,"We all know the stereotype: white, male, middle-aged, prone to creeping around beach bars and strip clubs of Southeast Asia's tourist playgrounds, often seen in the company of those who are much younger. This is the sort of person who comes to mind whenever stories of foreign paedophiles or child sex tourism come around, and they are the sort targeted by NGOs who are determined to save the children. A story from Cambodia last week provided a typical example: Seeing a Caucasian man playing a ukulele for two children in the streets near Siem Reap's red light district was reason enough for an investigator from Action Pour Les Enfants to call an agent. ""It's difficult,"" the informant told the AFP news agency. ""He could be a completely innocent and good person. But that's the kind of interaction we must look out for and follow up."" Stopping paedophiles from preying on and raping children in Thailand and other Southeast Asian tourism hotspots is important and valuable work. Such efforts -- provided the NGOs are working within the law, with law enforcement and catch the right people based on evidence rather than vigilantism -- are to be commended. But the emphasis on Western tourists in notorious nightspots threatens to overshadow other risks for children. Bangkok-based Ecpat International tried to shed light on the scale and complexity of the problem last week with the release of its Global Study on Sexual Exploitation of Children in Travel and Tourism. Along with a global report, which explained how the rise of cheap travel and the spread of the internet in the past 20 years had led to greater threats in more places, it also offered regional analyses. What comes across most clearly is the need to think beyond the stereotype. Thailand remains a ""global magnet"" and ""veritable hub"" for child sex abuse, but the greater vigilance of NGOs and a series of high-profile arrests has meant offenders are increasingly seeking places like Hat Yai and Chiang Mai rather than Bangkok and Pattaya, even venturing into Myanmar and Laos. ""Local NGOs suggest that whilst it is still possible to detect the presence of children for the purposes of sexual exploitation in places such as Bangkok, children are becoming less visible and are a more risky prospect for foreign sex offenders and thus, perpetrators are venturing to more isolated locations both within Thailand and in neighbouring countries."" Thailand has taken positive steps, but is a long way from being out of the business of child sex abuse. ""The vast majority of child sex offenders frequenting Southeast Asia are men and whilst child sex offenders are most likely to be nationals, foreign or transnational child sex offenders from a range of countries are also known to be exploiting vulnerable children in the region. Anecdotal evidence suggests that men of Asian origin are more likely than others to seek to sexually exploit virgin girls."" It added, ""Perpetrator nationalities tend to mirror the nationalities of tourism arrivals with Japan, China, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, South Korea, Australia, the US, the UK and other European nations highly represented."" It is worth remembering that Ecpat International's report is limited in its scope to travel and tourism. Naturally, an organisation dedicated to eliminating the abuse of children through prostitution, pornography and trafficking will focus on those issues -- it is important, difficult work. But society more broadly has to realise these abuses, while grievous, constitute the minority of sex crimes against children. In Thailand, like everywhere else in the world, the biggest risks for children come from those closest to them: family members, close family friends and those in positions of power like teachers are far more likely to commit sexual assault. The vast majority of abuses also go unreported as children are often scared into silence, disbelieved by adults or made to feel guilty; again, Thailand is far from unique in this regard. The cases that do get national attention are horrifying, almost numbingly so. The latest example came on Tuesday morning in Trang when an eight-year-old girl was given a drink laced with methamphetamine and raped, later dying from her injuries. The prime suspect was the girl's neighbour, but police said late last week they were hunting four other men who they believe were involved. Sex crimes often have deadly consequences, and young victims are especially vulnerable. The Trang case is another tragic example of a life cut short. Survivors of child sexual abuse are often left traumatised, physically or psychologically or both -- at the very least they have been through an ordeal no one should ever have to endure. While stranger danger is real, and the threat of travelling paedophiles cannot be downplayed or ignored, we cannot afford to lose sight of the dangers close to home."

											'Sextortion,' a new cyber crime, is common: study										",https://search.bangkokpost.com/track/visitAndRedirect?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bangkokpost.com%2Fworld%2F968709%2Fsextortion-a-new-cyber-crime-is-common-study&contentId=news968709,"WASHINGTON - Sextortion -- using nude photos of someone to press for even racier content or other goods -- is surprisingly common, a US think tank says in what it calls the first in-depth study of another danger lurking in cyberspace. Sextortion can entail a hack into someone's computer to rob a sexy picture or video or take over a webcam, then the use of this content to extort victims for even more	 Most victims are minors, the predators are almost always men who prey on multiple targets, and almost all adult victims are women, it said. Most victims choose to stay anonymous, out of shame. And while US law enforcement officials acknowledge the problem, no agency or advocacy group keeps data on it, said the Brookings Institution, which published the study on Wednesday. Even the term 'sextortion' is not a real word, but rather slang that prosecutors use to refer to an offense that does not fit neatly into a single category.  Depending on where you are in America, it can be prosecuted as child pornography, stalking, extortion or hacking. But sextortion as a crime per se does not exist, the think tank said.  ""Legally speaking, there's no such thing,"" the report states. Sextortion can entail a hack into someone's computer to rob a sexy picture or video or take over a webcam, then the use of this content to extort victims for even more. It is even more common for perpetrators to resort to social media to elicit a photograph from a victim, than use it to demand more. The Brookings Institution said it studied 78 cases from recent years that met its definition of sextortion and many others that contained elements of it. - A sad first - Those 78 were prosecuted in 29 states and territories of the United States and three foreign jurisdictions.   ""For the first time in the history of the world, the global connectivity of the Internet means that you don't have to be in the same country as someone to sexually menace that person,"" the study states. Those cases involve at least 1,379 victims. But for a variety of reasons -- such as prosecutors not seeking out all victims of a given predator -- the true number of victims from those 78 cases could actually range from 3,000 to 6,500 or even more, the study said. An accompanying report from the same think tank detailed how sentencing of people convicted in sextortion cases varies wildly because some are tried in federal court and some in state court. One man accused of victimizing at least 22 young boys and tried in a state court got a prison sentence of a year. But another alleged to have had one victim faced trial in federal court and got 12 years, the study found. The key to ending the disparity, it added, is for Congress to pass a federal sextortion law incorporating elements present in federal sexual abuse, extortion, child pornography, and abusive sexual contact statutes. The first report on the offense itself also provided harrowing details of actual sextortion cases. One involved a woman who opened an email from an unknown sender and found sexually explicit photos of herself, data about her job, husband and three kids, and a demand for a porno video of her. ""And if she did not send it within one day, he threatened to publish the images already in his possession, and 'let (her) family know about [her] dark side,'"" the study said."

""Our activities in this realm must be principled, but we must press beyond what we are doing today,"" he said. A UN report last year raised alarm about the ""growth of high-definition digital terror: the use of propaganda, primarily by Islamic State and its sympathizers, to spread fear and promote their distorted ideology."" IS recruiters have made savvy use of the Internet and social media to build up the group's pool of foreign fighters. About 30,000 foreign fighters have flocked to Syria, Iraq and other countries to join the ranks of jihadists."

Japanese artist Megumi Igarashi answers questions during a press conference following a hearing in Tokyo, in February 2016. The Tokyo District Court slapped Megumi Igarashi with a 400,000-yen ($3,700) fine, but the penalty was half what prosecutors had demanded as she was also cleared of one of several charges. Igarashi was arrested two years ago for trying to raise funds online to pay for the construction of a kayak by disseminating a coded 3D image of her genitals that would allow users to make copies. While Japan has a multi-billion-dollar pornography industry, actual depictions of genitalia are banned and the artist was charged in July 2014. Igarashi who calls herself Rokude Nashiko -- slang that loosely translates as ""reprobate child"" -- was released days later following a legal appeal and after thousands of people signed a petition demanding her freedom. But several months on, Tokyo police arrested her again for distributing ""obscene"" items -- displaying decorated plaster figures moulded in the shape of her genitals and sending and selling CD-ROMs containing the computer code. On Monday, the court convicted Igarashi for distributing material that was deemed obscene. Igarashi and her supporters scoffed at the fact her genitals were the focus of a court case. ""I am innocent because neither the data for female genitals nor my art works shaped like female genitals are obscene,"" she told the court last year. Prosecutors, who did not ask for jail time, had called for Igarashi to be fined 800,000 yen. Japan's prolific pornography industry caters to all imaginable tastes, but tough obscenity laws ban the showing of actual genitalia, which normally appear pixellated or blacked out. Images of male and female genitals can be found throughout the country, however. Last month, revellers carried giant phalluses through the streets of Kawasaki, near Tokyo, to worship the penis and pray for fertility in an annual festival."

Six months after the scandal broke they confirmed 17 of the accused remained in prison awaiting trial and three more were out on bail.  In March, Pakistan's Senate also passed a bill that criminalised sexual assault against minors, child pornography and trafficking for the first time -- previously only the acts of rape and sodomy were punishable by law. Under the revised legislation, which is awaiting ratification by the president, sexual assaults are punishable by up to seven years in prison.  Likewise child pornography, which was previously not mentioned in the law, is punishable by seven years in prison and a fine of 700,000 rupees.

But after previous debates in both chambers of parliament ended in deadlock, the lower house, dominated by the left, had the final say. The proposal introduced in October 2013 has divided public opinion in France, prompting a group of 343 public figures to issue what they called a ""scumbags' manifesto"" asserting the right to use prostitutes. The signatories, who included journalists, writers and actors, said they resented being depicted as ""perverts or psychopaths"" and refused to allow ""deputies (to) legislate norms on our desires and our pleasures"". Socialist lawmaker Maud Olivier, the architect of the bill, has argued repeatedly that prostitutes should be seen as ""victims and no longer as delinquents"". The new law will supersede a little enforced 2003 measure penalising the solicitation of clients for sex. - 'Changing the mentality' - ""This law is essential to ending the idea that it is normal to buy someone's body,"" Olivier told AFP. ""We will succeed in changing the mentality, but new efforts are needed to raise awareness, to train police officers and magistrates."" The new law will also require offenders to take a course to learn about the conditions faced by sex workers.  The bill calls for measures -- backed by an annual budget of 4.8 million euros -- to help prostitutes find other jobs and a six-month residency permit for foreign sex workers. The bulk of sex workers in France are from eastern Europe, Africa, China and Latin America. The law will ""increase police repression (and) degrade working conditions"" a member of the Strass sex workers union said at Wednesday's protest. Around 20 people held a counter-demonstration nearby waving a banner reading ""Prostitution, Just One Option, Abolition"". On Tuesday, 13 associations that support prostitutes joined forces to condemn the law which they said threatened the livelihoods of sex workers and was ""essentially repressive"". ""We already see the consequences. Those who can afford to have left for neighbouring countries, while others are looking for... procurers to put them in contact with clients,"" said Morgane Merteuil, another Strass member said earlier. Critics also point to the difficulty of proving payment for sex, since the money usually changes hands in private. And those who buy sex over the Internet are unlikely to be caught by the new law, experts say. ""Dating websites are one of the main ways to connect prostitutes and clients,"" said sociologist Laurent Melito. ""Then people call each other. How are you going to control that?"" The kinds of algorithms used to block child pornography and jihadist recruitment cannot be used to combat prostitution because the ""risk of error"" is too great, communications researcher Olivier Ertzscheid told AFP."

											Soccer in the dock again as Adam Johnson jailed										",https://search.bangkokpost.com/track/visitAndRedirect?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bangkokpost.com%2Fsports%2F910752%2Fsoccer-in-the-dock-again-as-adam-johnson-jailed&contentId=news910752,"LONDON - Football was accused of having a ""cultural problem"" as former England international Adam Johnson was sentenced to six years in prison after engaging in unlawful sexual activity with a 15-year-old fan. Former Sunderland footballer Adam Johnson (C) arrives at Bradford Crown Court in Bradford, northern England, on March 2, 2016	 Johnson, once a winger with Sunderland and Manchester City, was found guilty on Thursday following an incident in his Range Rover car in County Durham, northeast England, last year. It has become increasingly commonplace to hear English football fans voicing their disillusionment with the cash-rich Premier League. One criticism is that in paying the likes of Johnson a weekly wage of pound sterling60,000 ($84,675, 75,909 euros), more than three times the average annual salary in the town where they play, clubs such as northeast side Sunderland have created a generation of spoilt players, who then expect to be indulged off the field as well. It was a view that found echoes in a letter sent by Britain's NSPCC children's charity to the chairman of England's governing Football Association, Greg Dyke, on Thursday. ""The NSPCC's concern lies not in the behaviour of a single individual -- although that is horrifying -- but in the approach taken by Sunderland... We are worried this could be a cultural problem within football as a whole,"" wrote Peter Wanless, the charity's chief executive.  - 'Danger zones' - Johnson, 28, was sacked by struggling Premier League side Sunderland straight after his guilty plea. But the fallout saw the club's chief executive, Margaret Byrne, resign on March 8 after she accepted making a ""serious mistake"" in being party to letting Johnson play on for nearly a year despite knowing he had admitted to kissing a 15-year-old girl. Gordon Taylor, the chief executive of England's Professional Footballers' Association, insisted his organisation took child protection seriously and that his members were aware of ""danger zones"" involving young female fans. ""It's not as though we don't know the law of the land and we don't expect footballers to be immune from it,"" Taylor told BBC Sport after Johnson was sentenced. ""Of course there will be times when there are danger zones. With young women, particularly girls, then that's even more dangerous. ""So they (footballers) need to be very, very mindful and there's a line beyond which they just do not cross,"" insisted Taylor, who added the PFA needed to ""work even harder on these child protection and safeguarding issues"". Taylor said Johnson's chances of playing professionally again were ""very remote"", a view backed up by the experience of former Wales striker Ched Evans. Evans, currently appealing against his conviction for raping a 19-year-old woman, was released from prison in October 2014. He then saw an attempt to resurrect his career with third-tier club Oldham Athletic collapse amid a public outcry. That Johnson was later revealed, when reporting restrictions were lifted, to have also been arrested for possessing extreme pornography is unlikely to have shocked fans who have grown used to lurid tales involving footballers. Star France striker Karim Benzema, cleared on all charges in an underage sex trial in Paris two years ago, was indefinitely suspended from international duty in December after he was placed under investigation over an attempt to bribe France team-mate Mathieu Valbuena for a sex tape. It has still to be decided if Real Madrid forward Benzema will feature at the European Championships in France in June. Passing sentence at Bradford Crown Court, Judge Jonathan Rose said Johnson had taken advantage of a ""young teenager's adoration with celebrity"". But the recent imprisonment of several British entertainment industry figures showed football does not have a monopoly on illegal sexual conduct. "

A Japanese court has told Internet giant Google to hide a man's criminal past from its search results, saying he has 'the right to be forgotten' to rebuild his life	 The ruling parallels a move by the European Court of Justice, which said in 2014 that individuals have the right to ask Google to delete personal data produced by its search engine. Local media said it was Japan's first court decision that recognised ""the right to be forgotten"" in connection with Internet search results, though successful bids to remove results have previously been made citing a right to privacy. The Saitama District Court, north of Tokyo, in December upheld an earlier, temporary injunction against Google to delete search results about a man convicted of child prostitution and pornography-related offences and who was fined 500,000 yen ($4,400), the Yomiuri Shimbun reported Wednesday. Presiding judge Hisaki Kobayashi said that depending on the nature of the crime offenders have the ""right to be forgotten about past crimes, after passage of a certain period of time"", the Yomiuri reported, without naming the man or details of the crime. The internet company has appealed the case to Tokyo High Court, the Yomiuri said.

									Just before Christmas 2014, a United States Embassy attache in Bangkok received a phone call. The caller told him that an American man who was known to have sexually abused a 14-year-old boy in Pattaya had contacted the youth via Facebook to try to score another sexual date six months ahead.								 Over the next three months, this call sent US-based investigators to zero in on Clarence Edward Evers Jr of Evergreen, Alabama. They read his several email accounts, traced his contacts, looked at his photos and read ""trip reports"" to Thailand. The emails were shocking. Mr Evers reported for a friend and fellow Pattaya traveller in lurid detail of sex trysts with children. ""I was in heaven,"" he wrote of one session of anal intercourse with a teenage boy. At home in America, Mr Evers was a high school teacher of computer technology. He was a Boy Scout leader and veteran of many overnight field trips. Initial forensic examination turned up photos of naked children, US and Thai, on school computers. Clarence Edward Evers Jr US federal investigators had a case. It was no April Fool's when they showed Mr Evers the search warrant at his home on April 1 last year. They took away four big hard drives and found many more photos of children. One of the hard drives remains strongly encrypted, but if that is where the ""good stuff"" (ie the worst stuff) is, one must wonder how bad it is. The other drives and computers he used at home and school had nasty photos including infants and tiny children in sex acts, usually with adults. Mr Evers currently faces four charges of producing or receiving child pornography - and a fifth that he travelled to Thailand for sex with children. He has been jailed without bail, as both a flight risk and a danger to the community. US federal prosecutors say there could easily be more charges to come. Authorities say his case follows a familiar pattern, common to paedophiles who have long gravitated to Pattaya. In the summer of 2002, Mr Evers honoured Thailand by discovering it. He went every year after that during school vacation (May to August in Alabama). He says he had Thai friends who were willing to share. That's the cornerstone of the defence already described by his lawyer, Dennis Knizley, of Mobile, Alabama, 150km southwest of his client's home town. Mr Knizley is a flamboyant defence attorney ranked high by his peers for his effectiveness in getting his clients off. He specialises in drink-driving cases. How good is he? Well, he has himself been arrested and charged twice with drink-driving. In both cases he got charges dismissed for insufficient evidence. That's how good. Mr Knizley says Mr Evers is the victim of an over-reaching, interfering bunch of bureaucratic, government busy-body lawyers and prosecutors trying to put notches on their conviction sticks. You can already hear that dulcet southern accent of the Mobile lawyer addressing Mr Evers' jury: ""There's no crime in having a friend that lives in Thailand that you want to vacation with each year."" Details in Mr Evers' emails, photos and other correspondence — which no newspaper would print — make it clear his dozen annual trips weren't for the temples or shopping. The federal investigators received full cooperation from Google, Microsoft and smaller companies when they asked or got court warrants to get into Mr Evers' accounts. They included Gmail, Hotmail, his Alabama internet provider, his phone company and, of course, Hillcrest High School where he taught. Forensic experts who thought they'd seen pretty much all were shocked at the lengths — and the depths — Mr Evers went to on the school PCs. Messages via email and Facebook went into pornographic detail in describing what he wrote were his experiences in Thailand past and, he hoped, future. Hundreds of nude and pornographic photos of Thai boys were stored on the school machines. Most were encrypted but he was just careless enough that investigators have already sampled appalling specimens. Even the dry descriptions of the phones in official court documents cannot be reprinted here. Many of the emails (arguably too many) are in the court documents. In them, Mr Evers describes illegal sex encounter after encounter with underage boys. His delight shines through. For all his self-described infatuation and sex trysts with boys from eight to 17 (the oldest sex partner he reports) Mr Evers also kept up on the news. In February 2013, learning that a German and a British paedophile were arrested and charged in Pattaya, he emailed a friend: ""Oh Dear... Some familiar faces in the news. Gotta ponder on if/how it might impact my summer plans."" Apparently, not at all, as he was back in Thailand that year for another two-month stay. For months afterwards, his emails bragged as usual about doing what he did. His last trip was the following year, from June 6 to July 29, 2014. He skipped Pattaya and claimed in email he spent a short stay in Bangkok, then went to Bo Rai, Trat province. ""I spent time [with a boy who] has been with me from when he was nine to 15."" He had another trip booked beginning on June 6 last year. But someone called the US embassy about the Trat boy. After the feds served him with a search warrant on April 1, he quickly asked Delta Air Lines to cancel the flight and refund his $2,352.70. He can use that money for his lawyers. Thailand is short one tourist, thank goodness."

Prosecutors say the evidence against Clarence Evers, 52, includes pornographic images of children as well as emails in which he bragged about his activities in Thailand, according to the Alabama news portal AL.com. Mr Evers made his first appearance on Friday in US District Court in Mobile, Alabama. US Magistrate Judge Sonja Givins is expected to rule soon on whether he should be placed under house arrest while awaiting further legal proceedings. Federal prosecutors described him as a flight risk and a danger, while a family member and Mr Evers' lawyer portrayed him as a pillar of the community. The hearing took place one day after authorities unsealed a criminal complaint that charged the resident of Evergreen, Alabama with making trips to Thailand for more than a decade for sex tourism. He was also charged with producing and distributing child pornography. Mr Evers, who has taught for around 15 years, had been travelling to Thailand since 2002 during summer breaks from school, prosecutors said. He had a house in Klong Yai district of Trat province, the complaint states. Assistant US Attorney Maria Murphy said in the hearing that Mr Evers was a flight risk, citing a file in his Gmail that looked like a forged passport with a fake name and identification number. She also said that the accused spoke Thai well enough to ""support himself"", had money in bank accounts in the country, and may have a place to live and work in if he fled there. Kandace Whitehead, a Homeland Security Investigations special agent, said the investigation into Mr Evers began in 2014 when a Thai child reported abuse to Homeland Security in Bangkok. In April 2015, authorities raided the teacher's home and seized computers and files that were heavily encrypted. Investigators subsequently issued a summons to Facebook requesting account information for the ""Khun Buddy"" screen name used by Mr Evers to contact his Thai victim.  The victim also logged into a Facebook account and printed out five pictures of himself taken at three different locations, one being Mr Evers' house in Trat. Forensic computers in New Orleans and Washington DC were unable to crack the ""sophisticated"" codes required to access some materials, Ms Whitehead said. However, investigators retrieved some files including folders that catalogue sets of photos with minors in illicit sexual positions, she added. As well, investigators subpoenaed Google for access to Mr Evers' Gmail account, where they examined conversations and transactions. One email read: ""I plan to go back this summer to my residence place, where I am assured many friends, past and present await."" It noted that he had been with one of his ""friends"" aged between 9 and 15, using the Thai numerals. Two years ago, prosecutors said, Mr Evers discussed in an email with an acquaintance a string of related prosecutions in Thailand. ""I still plan to go this summer, but I definitely have to rethink my playtime strategy,"" he wrote, according to the complaint. ""It sure seems more apparent every day that we were there at a very good time in history, and that those good times are exactly that: history."""

It has made public its plans to do this and made it clear it will carry on attempts to convince foreign firms to delete information, reveal identities and transfer control of at least some discussions to the government. The known foreign targets of this pressure are Google, Facebook and Line. More, presumably, will follow. Because the military-appointed National Reform Steering Assembly was attempting to keep its meeting with Google secret, the NRSA will not explain its actions. According to leaked documents, members of the reform group told Google on Jan 22 that it wants the government to be able to order the removal of entries from the Google search engine. Google vice-president and deputy general counsel Matt Sucherman participated in the talks. All reports leaked from that meeting show that Mr Sucherman refused the NRSA's requests. This is the government's position, as relayed by the NRSA to Google, from a ""secret"" documents leaked from its offices: Sometimes, ill-intentioned people post material on the internet that is harmful to Thai national security, and the information is indexed by the Google search engine. Legal avenues are available to order the removal of the material, but it is tedious, and the damage may already be done. So Google could help Thailand if it just removes any material the government wants removed.

 Pol Man Gen Pisit Pao-in, the front man of the National Reform Steering Assembly's attempt to dominate and control the internet. The leaked material added a stunning detail. The NRSA officials apparently alluded to Google's operations in Thailand. The leaked document says they promised to help Google, in case the company was having any administrative problems, or if it encountered any in the future. Of course, the offer to help Google do business in Thailand had nothing at all to do with the request that Google could help the government by removing troublesome material from its search index. Google has never ceded any control over its content, or identified any of its users, barring at least a court order. There are other reasons why Google removes web-search material. It briefly censored Google Maps' satellite views of military airports. It removes internationally recognised criminal items such as child pornography. But in general, barring court action, Google's insistence on publishing has been impervious to government appeals. Google closed its entire operation in China rather than accede to demands it identify some of its Google Mail users. Other targets for the NRSA ""requests"" are Facebook and Line. These companies' policies on government cooperation are very close to Google's. Net users must hope that these firms, and others, follow Google in telling state officials that without a court order they cannot act against their own customers. The regime held similar talks with the big information providers shortly after the May 22, 2014, coup. Thus, the military certainly has a ""Plan B"" in mind. For example, a procurement document unearthed last week by researchers at Blognone.com revealed junta plans for surveillance of 500,000 individuals using Facebook, Twitter and Pantip.com accounts, and presumably others. The purchase of automated text-grabbing and facial recognition software for 12.8 million baht for this purpose already is under way. The internet ""single gateway"" plan is still in development. These are all violations of citizens' privacy and basic civil rights. Recent actions online and in the street clearly define the military regime's definition of a ""national security threat"". The government continues to turn the screws on open discussion. This ensures a failure of reconciliation efforts and badly harms the international image of Thailand."

Japanese artist Megumi Igarashi answers questions during a press conference following her final hearing before the verdict in Tokyo, on February 1, 2016	 Megumi Igarashi's case has drawn widespread attention and sparked accusations of heavy-handed censorship in a country known for its multi-billion-dollar pornography industry but where actual depictions of genitalia are banned. Igarashi was arrested in July 2014 for trying to raise funds online to pay for the construction of the kayak by disseminating a coded 3D image of her genitals. The artist, who calls herself Rokude Nashiko -- slang that loosely translates as ""reprobate child"" -- was released days later following a legal appeal and after thousands of people signed a petition demanding her freedom. But several months later, Tokyo police arrested her again on three counts of distributing ""obscene"" data -- namely CD-ROMs containing computer code for a 3D printer that would allow users to make copies of the vagina-shaped kayak. She was held in custody for around a month before being granted bail. Japan has a prolific pornography industry that caters to all imaginable tastes. But tough obscenity laws ban the showing of actual genitalia, which normally appear pixellated or blacked out. Prosecutors on Monday demanded that she be fined 800,000 yen (about $6,600) at a hearing at Tokyo District Court. A defiant Igarashi, however, said that she was resigned to the fact that prosecutors will probably appeal the case if she is found not guilty in May when the verdict will be handed down. ""And if I am found guilty, I will of course continue fighting,"" she told reporters after the court session. ""This battle is expected to be a long one."" Takashi Yamaguchi, one of Igarashi's lawyers, said that the prosecution was intent on making an example of Igarashi ahead of the Tokyo Olympics in 2020. ""I believe the Olympics is definitely one of the factors"" behind the decision to seek such a hefty fine, he added."

A Pakistani child abuse victim conceals his face during an interview with AFP	 He was one of 20 children sexually abused by a gang who sold videos of the acts and used them for blackmail purposes, in a scandal that shocked Pakistan. The police, who had conspicuously failed to act despite pleas from some parents, eventually arrested 37 men after clashes between relatives and authorities brought the issue into the media spotlight last summer, years after the abuse began. Six months after one of the country's biggest paedophilia scandal broke, police now confirm 17 of the accused remain in prison awaiting trial, while three more are out on bail.  But the young survivors who defied taboos to seek justice say they have little hope for rebuilding their lives.   In recent years, more and more families in this socially conservative Muslim country of 200 million have dared to speak out against sexual abuse of their children. But the fight against predators remains in its infancy. Powerful taboos, gaps in legislation and a lack of awareness continue to fuel a phenomenon that remains hidden, yet deeply embedded within society. - Media glare - Irfan drags his feet listlessly in the narrow winding streets of Hussain Khan Wala, a large village in rural Punjab. Like the other abused teens, he feels stigmatised and without any kind of support after five years of abuse. ""I feel terrible when my friends stare at me. I know what they are thinking,"" he mutters. ""My classmates and teachers look down on me, so I stopped going to school."" Though the scandal finally made it to the national news media in July, the local police were found to have turned a blind eye to the crimes for several months ""which amounts not only to criminal negligence, rather it was connivance,"" according to a report by the National Commission for Human Rights.  Several of the accused belong to locally influential families. It took a series of clashes between the survivors' families and police, in which dozens were injured, for politicians to act and demand arrests.  The families and survivors were then served up to the media, with some local leaders placing the number of abused children at 280 -- though that figure is believed to have been inflated as a result of attempts to leverage the tragedy for business and political gain. Authorities established that 20 youths were raped and sodomised, the only two sex crimes recognised under Pakistani law.  The country's penal code does not prohibit sexual abuse that does not involve penetration, nor child pornography. ""This scandal shows there are no institutional structures to tackle sexual abuse or to protect children,"" says Valerie Khan, the director of Group Development Pakistan, a local NGO which advocates legal reforms. A law criminalising sexual abuse of children is currently being debated by Pakistan's Senate. These reforms are all the more urgent given the growing number of cases being reported, according to child rights' group Sahil, which records statistics based on press reports in the absence of official data.  The group recorded fewer than 2,000 cases in 2008, but more than 3,500 in 2014, a rise it said ""reflects an increase in social awareness of the problem"". Veteran human rights activist Hina Jilani said that while increased reporting was welcome, cases must be handled sensitively -- noting that activists, judges and police were not trained in how to question child victims. Another obstacle to greater reporting of crimes are the families themselves, who are often reluctant to intervene when they feel their ""honour"" is at stake, according to Jilani. - Loss of self-worth - Eighteen-year-old Sonia says it was unreported childhood abuse, and the subsequent loss of her honour that drove her toward prostitution.  Forced to abandon her studies to work following the death of her father at the age of 16, she found herself at the mercy of an employer who she says raped her. ""If I would tell my family, they would not go to the police station,"" says the frail young woman, because of the shame it would bring. It was difficult for her to make her complaint herself because ""there (are) no lady police"" at the station, she said, and she quit her job fearing more attacks. Having lost her sense of worth, she turned to an intermediary at a beauty salon who guided her toward prostitution, which she now uses to support her family. Wearing light make-up and modern but modest clothing, she has all the airs of a carefree high-schooler -- apart from the fact she walks the streets alone at night. Back in Hussain Khan Wala, the parents of abused children are waiting for the government to help them rebuild their lives anew elsewhere. Muhammad, a labourer whose 17 year old son was among those abused, said ""(They) should be sent to Islamabad or abroad because they can not study here, you must remove them from the atmosphere."""

In Japan, possession of sexual images or videos of people under 18 can result in jail time after the government overhauled laws that had only banned the production and distribution of child pornography	 The Yokohama District Court sentenced Yuhei Takashima, 65, to two years in prison with the term suspended for four years, a spokesman told AFP. Takashima, who reportedly had sex with girls as young as 14, escaped prison with a promise not to offend again. Quoting the verdict, Japan's Jiji Press said the girls pictured were ""aged between 12 and 14"" and were photographed at a hotel in the Philippines about two years ago.  According to local media, Takashima had meticulously catalogued nearly 150,000 photographs of his sexual encounters over a 27-year period in around 400 separate albums. Takashima was quoted as having said in court that he ""has a habit of collecting things"" and wanted ""to keep the memories"". The former middle-school principal started paying for sex when he was dispatched to a Japanese school in Manila in 1988.  He later went on three sex tours a year to the country, making a total of 65 visits. During that time, he had sex with more than 12,000 women, with Nippon TV saying they were aged between 14 and 70. Presiding judge Naoko Omori called Takashima's action ""despicable and vicious,"" saying he ""took advantage of the economic plight of young girls"" in the Philippines, according to Jiji. ""Either in Japan or in the Philippines, children should be protected. He should have known that as a teacher,"" she said. Takashima should be condemned  for ""repeating indecent acts habitually to fulfil his sexual desire"" but he ""pledged he will never do it again,"" she said, according to public broadcaster NHK. Prosecutors had reportedly sought a two year prison term. In Japan, possession of sexual images or videos of people under 18 can result in jail time after the government overhauled laws that had only banned the production and distribution of child pornography.   The changes came into effect this summer, but it does not include drawings or digitally-created imagery. Anyone who ""possesses child pornography for the purpose of satisfying his/her sexual interest"" faces imprisonment of up to one year or a fine of up to one million yen ($8,300), according to the justice ministry."

											On the trail with the paedophile hunter										",https://search.bangkokpost.com/track/visitAndRedirect?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bangkokpost.com%2Fthailand%2Fspecial-reports%2F799904%2Fon-the-trail-with-the-paedophile-hunter&contentId=news799904,"When he learned last month a convicted Australian paedophile was teaching at a school in Thailand, Glen Hulley had an important decision to make. The former Melbourne detective was in Manila negotiating an MOU with Philippines police and justice officials on how his NGO, Project Karma, would investigate paedophile cases involving foreign nationals and locals. Safe from harm: Mr Hulley’s NGO Project Karma investigates paedophile cases involving foreigners and locals, and supports young people. But the name of the abuser, Peter Walbran, set alarm bells ringing. Through his previous work, Mr Hulley was aware of 59-year-old Walbran and his history of child abuse on Indonesia’s Lombok island for which he served two years in jail. The informant in the Walbran case was in Malaysia and had learned from blogs, administration boards and a Facebook photo that the Australian was teaching science at the Ubon Ratchathani school since last September. Although Project Karma only had A$60,000 (about 1.5 million baht) in its kitty through donations, Mr Hulley decided to leave the Manila negotiations and spend some of the NGO’s money flying to Malaysia to meet the informant. Using his policeman’s training and aware of the high standard of proof needed to pursue prosecutions against child sex offenders in foreign jurisdictions, he wanted a recorded statement as evidence to present to the Australian Federal Police and Thai police. “From the intelligence we got from that person, no one else was aware he was in Thailand teaching at the school,” Mr Hulley said. He returned to Australia and formulated a strategy to out Walbran with the help of several media organisations. On Nov 18, he flew to Thailand, a country, culture and legal system he was unfamiliar with. Dipping further into Project Karma’s limited funds, Mr Hulley hired a local private investigator to connect him with sources and informants to help in the investigation. “I only knew this guy was in the country and we had to get him out,” Mr Hulley told Spectrum. Several days later, Mr Hulley informed the AFP about Walbran’s case and booked a flight to Ubon Ratchathani. He conducted his own surveillance on Walbran, hiring locals to surreptitiously film him in and around his Charn Mansion condo in a poor neighbourhood on the outskirts of the city near the airport. An informant was also cultivated inside the school to keep tabs on Walbran. On Nov 23, Mr Hulley confirmed to the AFP Walbran was teaching at the school through surveillance photographs. Photos of the condo were also later sent to the AFP. After five days, the surveillance team backed off, waiting for news from the AFP, who said they had had a teleconference with the Department of Special Investigation on the case. On the ground: Glen Hulley is working to stop child sex abuse in Southeast Asian ‘hot spots’. Pol Lt Col Paisith Sungkahapong, the director of the DSI’s Bureau of Foreign Affairs and Transnational Crime, told Spectrum that they only became aware of the case after being informed by an AFP officer. The DSI ran a check on Walbarn and found he was employed at a high school in Ubon Ratchathani. Once the DSI had enough information, they sent an investigation team to monitor Walbran’s activities with the help of local police. “We monitored him and found that he is well-loved by locals because of his friendliness,” said Pol Lt Col Paisith. “We saw him with a young person he took on his motorcycle, but that turned out to be his boyfriend who is aged above 18.” But Mr Hulley was growing anxious. The AFP informed him that police wanted to execute an arrest warrant on Dec 8 or 9 — after tougher new child pornography laws with jail terms of up to 10 years came into affect on Dec 7. His biggest concern was the welfare of the children. He also feared that Walbran would flee across the border to Laos, which would lead to extradition problems. But he agreed to conform to the wishes of local and Australian police, who believed potential child abuse committed by Walbran in Thailand could be investigated while he was in custody. There was a proviso if children were at immediate risk. “Part of the agreement between both teams was if we witnessed him in the company of children the plan goes out the window and he will be arrested immediately,” said Mr Hulley. Walbran was arrested by police at his home on Dec 8 on suspicion of possession of child pornography. He was detained at Ubon Ratchathani Immigration Bureau while his computer and mobile phone were examined. His work visa was revoked and he has been blacklisted for paedophilia under Section 12 of the Immigration Act. He was deported to New Zealand on Thursday. SYSTEM FAILURES Walbarn’s case is a prime example of failures in monitoring the international travel of convicted sex offenders. After serving just over two years in a Lombok jail for the molestation and rape of boys as young as eight, he was deported to Australia. Walbarn had no valid passport — it had either expired or been cancelled — and he was issued with a temporary travel document. On his return to Australia he was ordered by a court in New South Wales to register on Australia’s National Child Offender Register. But he simply failed to do so and in the meantime obtained a valid passport from New Zealand, the country he was born in. Prime Minister John Key said at the time he didn’t know how Walbran obtained a New Zealand passport. “My advice at this stage is Mfat [Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade] doesn’t know about the individual,” he said. “It’s quite possible that it’s legitimate. There are people that [sic] have multiple passports because they have multiple citizenship. “So there are lots of people who travel on both an Australian and New Zealand passport and might theoretically do that at one time. But if it’s an illegal passport, that’s a very different issue but I don’t have any advice about that.” Mr Hulley said it’s a deep flaw of the Australian system that child offenders are instructed to “self register” without follow-up. “If they don’t fill it in they can flee and no one chases them. It shouldn’t be the responsibility of the offender,” said Mr Hulley, who believes all child sex offenders should have their passports revoked. Lt Col Paisith said it was very difficult to trace all foreign paedophiles who come to Thailand, especially those who are not on sex offender registers. The best option is to work with more than 30 embassies in Thailand who tip them off on criminal activities. “Without any tip-off or information on their criminal record, Thai officials would have no clue who these people are,” he said. “The immigration officers have the right to deny or grant access to the Kingdom if that person is a registered sex offender.” Mr Hulley said he only discovered Walbran was travelling on a New Zealand passport after this was confirmed by Thai Immigration, who checked details on his new travel document. “It’s a major flaw in the system, and I’m sure other paedophiles have done the same.” Lt Col Paisith acknowledged the role played by NGOs like Mr Hulley’s, which focus on issues such as child sex offenders. “It is very good that we have their help since they seem to have more comprehensive information on the area they are working on such as human trafficking or child sex abuse.” But Mr Hulley believes sex offender registers alone are not enough as convicted Australian paedophiles are permitted to travel if they fill out a notification form. AFP statistics showed 250 convicted child sex offenders travelled to the Philippines last year, and about 25 travel to Bali every month. “And they are just the ones we know about who have been through the system,” Mr Hulley said. Walbran arrived in New Zealand on Friday, where police met him on his return and reportedly described him as being cooperative with authorities. Because Walbran is not covered by the newly passed Returning Offenders Act, he can choose whether to engage with police in New Zealand. The office of the NZ Minister of Internal Affairs says no action can be taken over Walbran’s New Zealand passport because his sex crime convictions were under his Australian passport. The supervision regime under the act applies to returning offenders who were sentenced to more than one year in prison in another country; return to New Zealand within six months of their release from custody overseas; and were imprisoned for behaviour that would be an imprisonable offence under New Zealand law. DIFFICULT SOLUTIONS After 13 years working as a detective, a job he left in 2008, Mr Hulley was personally exposed to the problem of child prostitution while on holiday in Phnom Penh with his partner in 2013. He was offered a child prostitute for A$20, or about 500 baht. Teamwork: Mr Hulley at Unicef Philippines. “That shocked me and it stuck with me,” he said on the motivation to set up Project Karma. He briefly worked for a Dutch-based child rights organisation, Terre de Hommes, as an adviser and said while it had a “good model”, he recognised it had flaws. He oversaw 10 investigation teams in locations deemed as child sex offender hot spots across Southeast Asia, including Indonesia, the Philippines and Cambodia. Terre des Hommes gained international prominence in November 2013 when it used a computer-generated 10-year-old Filipina called Sweetie to try and trap child predators in internet chat rooms. It claimed that over a 10-week period more than 20,000 predators from 71 countries approached the virtual 10-year-old, asking for webcam sex performances, and that more than 1,000 paedophiles had been identified as a result. Mr Hulley praised the campaign for raising awareness about online abusers, but said it should have been used as a “stepping stone” to identify predators for further investigation. “You don’t have a victim. This is not a person it’s a computer program, unless this happens in a country where child pornography is covered by animation. They were expecting 1,000 convictions and there have been just three.” Mr Hulley is also wary of other “vigilante” groups which operate in Southeast Asia which rescue at-risk children without regard for the local legal system, law enforcement and international police. “It can take a long time to get to the top — in terms of winning the confidence of a general or politician who is on board — and then these idiots come along,” he said. He also has issues with foreign-funded NGOs only pursuing cases against expatriates. “The reality is that 85% of child sex abuse is conducted by locals,” he said. He concedes that while they actively pursued the Walbran case, this was not how Project Karma usually operates. But they believed they had to act swiftly due to the “clear and present danger” Walbran presented to children. Project Karma aims to raise A$2.8 million to set up investigation teams in the Philippines, Indonesia, Cambodia and Thailand. The teams would consist of investigators, lawyers and social workers and work with local NGOs and trusted police. Mr Hulley said what they are hoping to bring to the equation are credible, legal investigations which would be handed to police for verification. A key part of Project Karma’s model is to build a local intelligence network of informers — such as taxi drivers, teachers and hospital workers — who consider their organisation the “first port of call”. A support network of registered NGOs to provide safe houses, shelter, counselling and medical care was also needed. “There is an identified gap that is not being filled,” Mr Hulley said. “The [local] police are not resourced enough and this type of crime is not a high priority. Nothing is getting solved.” A larger objective is to target criminal groups behind child trafficking. “Child prostitution is big business facilitated by local crime groups,” Mr Hulley said. “Targeting just the users, you’re not going to stop the market. Sophisticated crime groups utilise corruption in a corrupt part of the world to infiltrate government and law enforcement.” Mr Hulley is hopeful that if his model takes off, the fund-raising and intelligence gathering methods will be replicated in other countries. “The day this model is set up in another country and has nothing to do with me is the day I know I’ve done my job,” he said. Joint effort: Mr Hulley with officers from the Royal Thai Police and Department of Special Investigation. Trusted contact: Mr Hulley uses his police training and works with locals to track sex offenders. PHOTOS: BANGKOk POST ARCHIVE/ SUPPLIED/ SYDNEY MORNING HERALD AND GLEN HULLEY"

											Giving protection to a generation at risk										",https://search.bangkokpost.com/track/visitAndRedirect?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bangkokpost.com%2Fthailand%2Fspecial-reports%2F799912%2Fgiving-protection-to-a-generation-at-risk&contentId=news799912,"It’s early evening, and Smornthum Suknirundr waits outside in a van with the rest of her team as a male volunteer enters the Bangkok gay bar. Inside it is mostly young men — just the demographic Ms Smornthum is looking for. The volunteer approaches men inside the venue, asking them whether they would like to be tested for HIV. The method is simple: a quick swab of the mouth with a cotton tip is all that is needed to detect antibodies for the virus. The men are each given a number and asked to wait while the samples are taken back to the van for analysis. When the testing is finished, they can come out to ask for their results. “We give them the results without asking any questions,” Ms Smornthum said. At one venue, 27 out of the 50 men who were tested are found to be HIV-positive. But only some of them bothered to come out to ask for their results. “I am not sure whether they are ignorant, whether they already know the result or if perhaps they just don’t care,” Ms Smornthum said. One young man who returned a positive test is encouraged to go back and tell the others. “He has just had unprotected sex with four people,” Ms Smornthum said. She then advised him on his options for medical treatment. “He is lucky to have access to early detection because the infection can be treated,” she said. Ms Smornthum has been working to promote sex education for decades. An educator at the Population and Community Development Association, she has lectured at schools, met with sex workers and provided phone hotline advice on sex education and family planning. Still, she was surprised by her recent findings when she conducted a survey for HIV infection rates among young men who have sex with men (MSM). Chutima Saisaengjan, coordinator of the Children and Youth Programme at the Thai Red Cross Aids Research Centre, said, “The level of ignorance and misunderstanding of people when it comes to HIV/Aids is still high. We have found many adolescents are HIV-positive.” She admitted part of this might be because campaigns to raise awareness of the virus may be encouraging more people to come forward for voluntary testing. A change to health regulations also means adolescents can now test for HIV without parental consent. But Ms Chutima said teenagers remain the most vulnerable group in Thailand. “Some don’t have proper knowledge about how to protect themselves,” she said. “The death rate among adolescents with HIV/Aids is higher than other groups because they don’t know how to take care of themselves.” ‘IT CAN BE TREATED’ “I contracted HIV when I was 15 years old,” said Mr A, now 18, who preferred not to use his real name. “I had unprotected sex with my partner. I was very young then. I was not fully aware of the importance of safe sex.” Before the virus was detected, Mr A began suffering from various symptoms such diarrhoea alternating with constipation. He went to a clinic in Bangkok operated by the Thai Red Cross, and was soon given the news that he had HIV. Breaking taboos: Teacher Sumon Kananit is encouraging open discussion. He told his mother, whose initial shock quickly gave way to support as he began his treatment. “I am lucky that I have support from my family to go through this,” he said. Today, Mr A studies at university. He looks healthy. “I take a tablet every day to control the HIV. I want to make people understand the nature of HIV infection, that it can be treated and prevented,” he said. “People who are found to be infected can receive medical treatment and live their lives as normal.” Mr A said society still had many misconceptions about HIV. “There is a stigma attached,” he said. He recalled telling a work colleague that he had HIV. The next day, he was fired by his employer. “Even these adults do not understand that HIV is not easily transmitted,” he said. The stigma surrounding a positive diagnosis prevents many from getting tested in the first place. “HIV/Aids patients are often portrayed as hopeless and dying characters, which is not always the case,” said Mr A. He said it was critical that schools provide more practical information to adolescents. “Sex education should not only be about anatomy, but who we can go to for advice and what kind of services are available to us,” Mr A said. But Mr A is a rare case among adolescents, in that he decided to test for HIV and sought medical treatment. “Many refuse to receive any treatment. They are still under the misunderstanding that a HIV diagnosis is the end of the road,” Ms Chutima said. She said the stereotypical image of HIV/Aids patients in the media made some adolescents feel too scared to approach the Red Cross or other health centres for testing. UNSAFE SEX While the number of new HIV infections among adolescents (aged 15-19) fell from 4,300 in 2004 to 1,600 last year, the group remains disproportionately represented in HIV/Aids statistics. Unicef is aiming to stop new infections among this group as part of efforts to help Thailand achieve its zero infection goal as soon as possible. The key demographic Unicef is focused on is young MSM, which includes gay men, male sex workers and transgenders. In Thailand, according to recent UN figures, 11% of MSM aged under 25 are HIV-positive. This compares with 8.3% of MSM aged over 25. Among female sex workers, another high-risk group, HIV prevalence was much lower at 1.8% in 2011. “Everyone is at risk, but MSM are more at risk due to their sexual behaviour, number of partners and how causal it is for them to change their sexual partner,” said Beena Kuttiparambil, chief of HIV/Aids (Adolescent Development) at Unicef Thailand. The reason that adolescents are the focus group in Thailand, she said, is because of the stigma that prevails. Despite Thailand’s seeming openness about sexual orientations, stigma still plays an important role when it comes to adolescents accessing information or support, Ms Beena said. The same UN data, for example, found that only 27% of Thai MSM aged under 25 had received an HIV test and knew their result. That figure was far below Indonesia (92.3%), Myanmar (44.6%) and Cambodia (33%). “Thai sex education is very good, but parents still feel uncomfortable talking about sexuality issues with their children,” Ms Kuttiparambil explained. STARTING YOUNG Ms Smornthum attributed the high HIV/Aids infection rate among young people to a refusal by parents to discuss such issues, and adults’ unwillingness to accept that teenagers are having sex earlier than they might have in previous generations. “Many teenagers these days tell me they started having sex when they were 12. Their attitude has changed from the past. They think it is OK to have sex from early age,” said Ms Smornthum, who speaks regularly to young people about sex through her counselling services. “Some teenagers show off by collecting points based on the number of people they have slept with. I just spoke to a group of teenage students who didn’t have a proper education about sex, but are competing in this game. They thought it was safe to have anal sex, so they did not use a condom, even though in fact it is also risky to do that.” Efforts to increase condom use have met opposition. An initiative to put condom vending machines in schools across the country, for example, has not always been welcomed by teachers and parents. “Some principals said the machines would encourage students to have sex early,” Ms Smornthum said. “Some schools which cater to a broad age group were against the idea because they would not be able to prevent young students from seeing or using the vending machines since they share bathrooms with the adolescent students.” She said the gap between young people’s perception towards sex and the conservative attitudes of older generations has discouraged some from protecting themselves because they feel embarrassed to ask for advice or buy condoms. “Teenagers know about sex. They can learn from Google and new media these days. But when young people want to buy condoms, they often face judgemental stares,” Ms Smornthum said. She said the Public Health Ministry had planned to produce special condom packaging to allow young people who are shy to ask for the right size. The condoms would be colour coded based on size. The plan has not been implemented yet. Sex education in schools meanwhile remains light on practical detail. Ms Smornthum said she has to be creative in devising ways to discuss sex in an open setting. Recently, she used cucumbers to teach around 1,200 male technical students how to measure their penis size so that they would be able to purchase condoms that would fit them properly. “So they won’t be awkward about asking for the right ones.” LEARNING CURVE Some schools have taken the initiative and are promoting better quality sex education in an effort to prevent teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted disease among students. Satri Witthaya 2 Secondary School is one of them. Last week, it organised a sex education camp for 150 students. “We want to give students a better understanding [of safe sex] as they are growing up. And it is safe for them to learn about this from school,” said Sumon Kananit, a teacher who organised the half-day event. The students had an open discussion with outside volunteers about the differences between HIV and Aids, and how to have safe sex. A group of parents observed the event in the school’s auditorium. Although young students giggled at times, they were attentive. Some blew condoms up like balloons to test their elasticity. Nannapat Manokulanon, a 13-year-old student, said she had learned new things such as how to use a condom and the different stages of pregnancy termination. Chanana Rattanakanungthum, a 14-year-old Mathayom 3 student, said, “I know now that an HIV infection is not as scary as I thought.” Ms Sumon said when she first tried to incorporate sex education into classroom teaching, she faced resistance from conservative parents. She recalled one time when she taught students about basic anatomy by showing them illustrated depictions of the human reproductive system. “One of the students’ parents came to school to complain that I had showed their child pornography,” she said. Ms Sumon said having the cooperation of parents is essential to educating young people about sex, which is why Satri Witthaya 2 School invited parents to observe the sex education camp. Visanu Wattanarujiwong, one of the parents, said, “I want my 13-year-old to learn about sex education. One of our relatives had to quit school because she had unprotected sex with her boyfriend and she became a mother before she finished school.” Asked what would be appropriate an age for adolescents to have sex, Mr Visanu said, “I told my daughter that she should wait until she finishes high school, or even better, wait until you graduate university and are working.” Hope lives: Kai, 19, was born with HIV. New infections among teens fell from 4,300 in 2004 to 1,600 last year, but the age group remains over represented. Out in the open: Satri Witthaya 2 Secondary School last week held a sex education camp for 150 students. Teacher Sumon Kananit said she would have struggled to organise the event in the past. Parental guidance: Parents of Satri Witthaya 2 Secondary School pupils support sex education. Take cover: Staff from the Phaya Thai district office give away condoms to passers-by in the Saphan Khwai area, as part of a safer sex campaign to mark World Aids Day."

James Craig Neumann, 67, was taken into custody at his home in tambon Khulek Tuesday by officers from the Department of Special Investigation and representatives from the US embassy's Homeland Security investigative team. Mr Neumann was a former English-language teacher in Thailand known for enticing young boys in his neighbourhood to come over to play at his house, police said. A search of his house uncovered hundreds of indecent images of children on computers as well as evidence he had shared pictures over the internet. Police said they would try to identify boys in the photos to determine if sexual molestation charges would also be filed against the American. Under newly enacted child-pornography legislation, Mr Neumann faces up to five years in prison, fine of 100,000 baht or both. The arrest is the second in a week involving foreign teachers accused of paedophilia. Convicted Australian paedophile Peter Walbran was arrested last week in Ubon Ratchathani where he was teaching teenagers, prompting the Office of Basic Education Commission to order schools to carry out background checks on their foreign instructors."

It remains to be seen how much can be done by social networks designed for sharing updates and which have hundreds of millions of users	 But it's more complicated than it sounds: networks like Facebook and Twitter support free expression, and filtering our bad actors is challenging both from a technical and civil liberties perspective. Still, US and European officials are pressing social media to do more following deadly attacks over the past few weeks in Paris and southern California which have been linked to supporters of the Islamic State organization. A White House statement earlier this month called for ""a dialogue"" with Silicon Valley and others on the subject, saying more should be done ""when the use of social media crosses the line between communication and active terrorist plotting."" The European Commission has also called for dialogue with the major social media networks. And France passed emergency measures that could shut down websites or social media accounts which encourage terrorist actions. Concerns have been rising amid increased presence on social networks of radical groups  that seek to recruit fighters and communicate for planning. FBI Director James Comey said the Islamic State organization, also known by the acronym ISIL, ""has persistently used the Internet to communicate, and its widespread reach through the Internet and social media is most concerning."" Comey said that through social media, ""the message of radicalization spreads faster than we imagined just a few years ago.""  In Congress, Senators Dianne Feinstein and Richard Burr proposed legislation to require online communications services to report potential terrorist activity. ""That information can be the key to identifying and stopping terrorist recruitment or a terrorist attack, but we need help from technology companies,"" said Feinstein, from California. - Consequences for freedom - But it remains to be seen how much can be done by networks designed for sharing updates and which have hundreds of millions of users. And some say even if they could help in the fight against radicalization, the civil liberties price would be too high. ""Having government pressuring, or encouraging companies to do more, carries with it a lot of consequences for individual freedom,"" says Emma Llanso, a free speech specialist at the Center for Democracy and Technology. An open letter from technology organizations including the Internet Association, which represents major social networks, warned of the negative consequences of the proposal known as the Requiring Reporting of Online Terrorist Activity Act. Such a law ""would impose a new government mandate requiring a broad spectrum of companies to report users' activities and communications to the US government, ultimately not achieving national security gains,"" the letter said. The proposal ""risks chilling free speech, including counterterrorism speech, and also chilling innovation"" and ""it contradicts and undermines 20 years of federal Internet policy that remains the legal foundation of the Internet's transformative role in promoting democratic values and free speech worldwide."" Although online companies are able to detect and report child pornography using algorithms and a database of inappropriate content, applying this to terrorism is more challenging. ""Millions of pieces of content are received every day, making the idea of proactive monitoring and viewing before posting and uploading completely impossible,"" Llanso said. - Voluntary efforts - Social media groups say they already do what they can to avoid being used to spread hate and violence. ""There is no place on Facebook for terrorists, terrorist propaganda or the praising of terror,"" said Monika Bickert of the world's biggest social network, saying it employs a global team which works around the clock in numerous languages for monitoring. ""Our community standards make this clear, and we work aggressively to ensure that we do not have terrorists or terror groups using the site."" Twitter says it has a similar policy and also actively monitors its network. ""Violent threats and the promotion of terrorism deserve no place on Twitter and our rules make that clear,"" a spokesman said.  The video-sharing service YouTube, owned by Google parent Alphabet,  ""has a strong track record of taking swift action against terrorist content,"" a spokesman said. ""We have clear policies prohibiting terrorist recruitment and content intending to incite violence and quickly remove videos violating these policies when flagged by our users. We also terminate accounts run by terrorist organizations or those that repeatedly violate our policies."" But mandatory legislation raises a risk that social media firms will overreport to remain in compliance, said Sophia Cope of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and in doing so raises suspicion on many law-abiding citizens. ""These people will be under the cloud of government suspicion for exercising their First Amendment rights,"" she said. Michael Beckerman, president and chief executive of the Internet Association, agreed, saying the Burr-Feinstein measure would lead to ""a vague and unworkable standard for reporting and a massive new liability regime that could chill free speech and innovation online. He added: ""The legislation incentivizes Internet platforms to overreport, even poor quality information, to authorities, making it more difficult to find credible threats."""

The suspect, who holds Australian and New Zealand passports, was jailed in Indonesia in 2012 over the rape and molestation of boys as young as eight. Bureau of Foreign Affairs and Transnational Crime director Paisith Sungkahapong said Peter Dundas Walbran was arrested yesterday morning at an apartment in Muang district where he lived. Police swooped following a tip-off that Mr Walbran was in possession of child pornography.

 Convicted Australian paedophile Peter Dundas Walbran is led away by police after a search of his Ubon Ratchathani home. (Photo by Dusit Singkhiri) A search was conducted after new legislation on child abuse came into effect on Tuesday. The new law states offenders caught with child abuse material can be jailed for up to 10 years. Thai police, Australian police attache Glen Tankard, police from the Immigration Bureau, provincial police officers and officials from the Central Institute of Forensic Science escorted Mr Walbran to the Ubon Ratchathani Immigration Bureau to be detained. Pol Lt Col Paisith said Australian Federal Police agents sought help from Thai police by submitting a letter to the Department of Special Investigation, asking it to search for Mr Walbran. Police tracked down Mr Walbran who had entered Thailand last year and found he was employed as a teacher at a school in Ubon Ratchathani, he said. Police had gathered evidence that pointed to the suspect having a history of sexually abusing young boys, he said. Mr Walbran was deported from Indonesia to Australia and then fled to Thailand last year. It is believed he dodged being registered on  Australia's National Child Offender Register. His detention was carried out with collaborative efforts of police officers from the provincial Immigration Bureau and police officers, Pol Lt Col Paisith said. Immigration Division 4 chief Patipat Subun na Ayutthaya said his division had revoked Mr Walbran's visa as he had been blacklisted for paedophilia under Section 12 of the Immigration Act. Mr Walbran has been detained at Ubon Ratchathani Immigration Bureau pending his deportation to Australia, police said."

Peter Dundas Walbran, a former head of the Australian International School in Jakarta, was taken into custody by Thai and Australian Federal Police who spent five hours searching his room at the Chan Mansion on Pasi Charoen Road in Muang district for child pornography, said Pol Lt Col Paisit Sangkhahapong, head of the Department of Special Investigation's Foreign Affairs and Transnational Crime Bureau. The Sydney Morning Herald reported that Walbran was jailed in 2012 for the rape and molestation of Indonesian boys as young as eight. The newspaper said he was employed as a teacher at Narinukun International School in the northeastern province, despite extensive media coverage of his prior child-molestation crimes. Pol Lt Col Paisit said he entered Thailand last year. The Narinukun school cancelled Walbran's work contract on Wednesday, the report said. He was held at an immigration detention centre and was expected to be transferred to Bangkok on Wednesday. He will be deported to Australia after his visa was cancelled and he was declared persona non grata by immigration officials. The Sydney newspaper noted Walbran was supposed to have been listed on Australia's National Child Offender Register. The report said police in Ubon Ratchathani had had Walbran under surveillance for some time and saw him with children from his neighbourhood several times since Monday. Authorities also plan to question a young Thai man who has been living with Walbran, the newspaper reported. Walbran was sentenced to three years' jail on the Indonesian island of Lombok in 2012 where he paid about 100 baht for sexual services. He was suspended from his school in 2007 and returned to Australia before the police investigation was complete. He was extradited to Indonesia in October 2011 and served almost two years of the three-year term on Lombok before being deported to Australia in April last year. He was ordered to register his Indonesian convictions with Australia's National Child Offender Register, but failed to do so. He then left the country early this year on a New Zealand passport, the Morning Herald said. Had he been on the child-sex-offender register he would have been required to report his travel plans and Australian police would have alerted Thai authorities."

Under the proposed law companies would not be required ""to monitor customers or undertake any additional action"" but merely responsible for reporting any observed terrorist activity	 ""If companies become aware of terrorist activity such as attack planning, recruitment or distribution of terrorist material, they must report that information to law enforcement,"" a statement put out by Democrat Dianne Feinstein's office said. The law, proposed by Feinstein and Republican Richard Burr, is based on similar legislation already used to fight online child pornography. The statement emphasized that companies would not be required ""to monitor customers or undertake any additional action"" but were merely responsible for reporting any observed activity. Feinstein tweeted that ""the bill does not criminalize free speech. It requires warning of potential terrorist behavior."" The proposed measure comes less than a week after two shooters, Syed Farook, 28, and his Pakistani wife Tashfeen Malik, went on a rampage in San Bernardino, California killing 14 people and injuring 21 more. Top security officials believe the pair had been radicalized, with investigators probing reports the 29-year-old Malik had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group in a Facebook post. ""We're in a new age where terrorist groups like ISIL are using social media to reinvent how they recruit and plot attacks,"" Feinstein said, using an alternate acronym for IS. ""That information can be the key to identifying and stopping terrorist recruitment or a terrorist attack."" SIIA, a software company association, believes the legislation would do more harm than good, creating larger government surveillance, according to its vice president Mark MacCarthy."

Decide how to be your end, with knife or bomb."" That comment was posted from the 335th Twitter account of a pro-Islamic State group that calls itself Asawitiri Media. Twitter has repeatedly tried to cut off the authors of the account, most recently known to its thousands of followers as @TurMedia335, @TurMedia334 and @TurMedia333. As soon as Twitter suspends one account, a new one is created. After the group's 99th account was suspended, it taunted Twitter by creating @IslamicState100, posting images of birthday candles, cake, trophies and fireworks. A logo of Twitter is pictured next to the logo of Facebook. Facebook, Google and Twitter are stepping up efforts to combat online propaganda including recruiting attempts by Islamic militants, but their efforts have so far been useless. REUTERS Politicians and even some technologists say that account, and hundreds just like it, show how Silicon Valley's efforts to crack down on the use by terrorists of social media and other technologies, like encryption, have been toothless. And on Sunday, Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential front-runner, called on tech companies to become more aggressive. ""Resolve means depriving jihadists of virtual territory, just as we work to deprive them of actual territory,"" she told an audience at the Brookings Institution in Washington. ""They are using websites, social media, chat rooms and other platforms to celebrate beheadings, recruit future terrorists and call for attacks. We should work with host companies to shut them down."" But as the 335 versions of the pro-IS Twitter account demonstrate, technology companies are dealing with a tenacious adversary. Also, when it comes to terrorists using encryption technologies to hide their communications -- a frequent complaint of law enforcement -- technology companies are quick to point out that of the top five encryption apps recommended by IS, none are American-made. Indeed, members of IS used technology created by a company in Germany to claim credit for last month's attacks in Paris, and text messages discovered on one of the attackers' phones suggested that the attackers were not even using encryption. Still, while the tech industry cannot block all terror content on the Web, people who have battled other online threats say it could be doing more. They point to technology that has successfully eradicated large swathes of child pornography on the Web, or even older tools for spotting computer viruses, as potential guideposts for blocking terror-related content. ""When Twitter says, 'We can't do this,' I don't believe that,"" said Hany Farid, chairman of the computer science department at Dartmouth College, who co-developed the child pornography tracking system with Microsoft. The actual task of identifying child pornography is managed by the National Centre for Missing & Exploited Children. Mr Farid said the same technology could be applied to terror content, so long as companies were motivated to do so. ""There's no fundamental technology or engineering limitation,"" he said. ""This is a business or policy decision. Unless the companies have decided that they just can't be bothered."" The 335 pro-IS accounts certainly did not escape the notice of executives at Twitter after it carried simultaneous death threats against Jack Dorsey and Dick Costolo, Twitter's current and former chief executives. And its recent naming convention -- adding one digit to a new account after the last one is suspended -- does not seem as if it would require artificial intelligence to spot. Asawitiri Media also uses the same photo of a bearded man's face over and over again, said Rita Katz, the director of SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks terrorists' communications. ""The bottom line is that Twitter is not doing enough,"" Ms Katz said. ""With the technology Twitter has, they can immediately stop these accounts but they have done nothing to stop the dissemination and recruitment of lone wolf terrorists."" In response, Twitter said it actively investigated potential terrorist threats. ""Violent threats and the promotion of terrorism deserve no place on Twitter, and our rules make that clear,"" a Twitter spokesman said. ""We have teams around the world actively investigating reports of rule violations, and they work with law enforcement entities around the world when appropriate."" The White House yesterday also urged the technology industry to do more. ""There should be common ground the government and tech can find to address this concern and make sure the American people are safe,"" said Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, echoing comments made earlier by President Barack Obama. Conversations between government officials and tech companies have been going on for more than a year, but since the mass shootings in San Bernardino and Paris, ""there has been a reintensified or reinvigorated engagement"", according to a senior administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity. But some who advocate free speech argue that relying on companies like Twitter and Facebook to be more aggressive arbiters of what constitutes free speech puts those companies in a difficult spot. ""We don't believe that law enforcement should delegate their responsibilities to private enterprise,"" said David Greene, director for civil liberties at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. ""Especially ones that haven't sought out that role."" In some cases, internet companies have been criticised for not taking down websites that belong to IS, only to have it discovered later that the sites were critical of it. Matthew Prince, chief executive of CloudFlare, a San Francisco company, said that in one case internet activists criticised his company for keeping several IS websites online when, in fact, the sites in question were pro-Kurdish. ""It's particularly risky to take a bunch of tech companies that are not certified policy experts and insert them into Middle East politics,"" Prince said. Pulling all terror-related content is not always preferred by law enforcement. In several cases, tech executives say, they have been asked to keep terror-related content online so that law enforcement agents can monitor terrorist networks or because the content was created by law enforcement agents to lure terrorists into divulging information. The issue is thornier for companies like Facebook, in which the bulk of posts are meant to be private. ""Do you want Facebook looking at over 1.5 billion people's posts?"" said Zeynep Tufekci, an assistant professor in technology policy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. ""And if so, then for what?"" Facebook primarily relies on user reports to ferret out terrorist accounts, but recently it has gone further. If the company is informed of specific terrorist activity, Facebook will take down the account as well as others similar to the one reported. Last week, it went a step further. Tashfeen Malik, one of two terrorists involved in the San Bernardino attacks, posted her public allegiance to IS on Facebook just minutes before the shootings last week. The post did not trigger any user reports to Facebook, and until now it had been unclear how the authorities were able to tie Malik to the post. According to law enforcement officials, the Facebook account that Malik used was linked to an email account she had used for many years. Facebook found the posting, reported it to the FBI, and removed it last Thursday. ""We work aggressively to ensure that we do not have terrorists or terror groups using the site, and we also remove any content that praises or supports terrorism,"" said Monika Bickert, head of global product policy at Facebook. Addressing the topic yesterday, the White House urged Silicon Valley to find a compromise. ""We are going to resist the urge to trample a bunch of civil liberties,"" Mr Earnest said in the White House briefing. But he added, ""We don't want terrorists to have a safe haven in cyberspace."" ©2015 The New York Times "

On Friday, Facebook Inc said it took down a profile that the company believed belonged to San Bernardino shooter Tashfeen Malik, who with her husband is accused of killing 14 people in a mass shooting that the FBI is investigating as an ""act of terrorism"". Just a day earlier, the French prime minister and European Commission officials met separately with Facebook, Google, Twitter Inc and other companies to demand faster action on what the commission called ""online terrorism incitement and hate speech"".

 The Anonymous hacking collective has also ""declared war"" on the Islamic State propagandists online. (Reuters photo) The internet companies described their policies as straightforward: They ban certain types of content in accordance with their own terms of service, and require court orders to remove or block anything beyond that. Anyone can report, or flag, content for review and possible removal. But the truth is far more subtle and complicated. According to former employees, Facebook, Google and Twitter all worry that if they are public about their true level of cooperation with Western law enforcement agencies, they will face endless demands for similar action from countries around the world. They also fret about being perceived by consumers as being tools of the government. Worse, if the companies spell out exactly how their screening works, they run the risk that technologically savvy militants will learn more about how to beat their systems. ""If they knew what magic sauce went into pushing content into the newsfeed, spammers or whomever would take advantage of that,"" said a security expert who had worked at both Facebook and Twitter, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue. One of the most significant yet least understood aspects of the propaganda issue is the range of ways in which social media companies deal with government officials. Facebook, Google and Twitter say they do not treat government complaints differently from citizen complaints, unless the government obtains a court order. The trio are among a growing number that publish regular transparency reports summarising the number of formal requests from officials about content on their sites. But there are workarounds, according to former employees, activists and government officials. A key one is for officials or their allies to complain that a threat, hate speech or celebration of violence violates the company's terms of service, rather than any law. Such content can be taken down within hours or minutes, and without the paper trail that would go with a court order. ""It is commonplace for federal authorities to directly contact Twitter and ask for assistance, rather than going through formal channels,"" said an activist who has helped get numerous accounts disabled. In the San Bernardino case, Facebook said it took down Malik's profile, established under an alias, for violating its community standards, which prohibit praise or promotion of ""acts of terror"". The spokesman said there was pro-Islamic State content on the page but declined to elaborate. Some well-organised online activists have also had success getting social media sites to remove content. A French-speaking activist using the Twitter alias NageAnon said he helped get rid of thousands of YouTube videos by spreading links of clear cases of policy violations and enlisting other volunteers to report them. ""The more it gets reported, the more it will get reviewed quickly and treated as an urgent case,"" he said in a Twitter message. A person familiar with YouTube's operations said company officials tend to quickly review videos that generate a high number of complaints relative to the number of views. Relying on numbers can lead to other kinds of problems. Facebook suspended or restricted the accounts of many pro-Western Ukrainians after they were accused of hate speech by multiple Russian-speaking users in what appeared to be a coordinated campaign, said former Facebook security staffer Nick Bilogorskiy, a Ukrainian immigrant who helped some of those accounts win appeals. He said the complaints have leveled off. A similar campaign attributed to Vietnamese officials at least temporarily blocked content by government critics, activists said. Facebook declined to discuss these cases. What law enforcement, politicians and some activists would really like is for internet companies to stop banned content from being shared in the first place. But that would pose a tremendous technological challenge, as well as an enormous policy shift, former executives said. Some child pornography can be blocked because the technology companies have access to a database that identifies previously known images. A similar type of system is in place for copyrighted music. There is no database for videos of violent acts, and the same footage that might violate a social network's terms of service if uploaded by an anonymous militant might pass if it were part of a news broadcast. Nicole Wong, who previously served as the White House's deputy chief technology officer, said tech companies would be reluctant to create a database of jihadists videos, even if it could be kept current enough to be relevant, for fear that repressive governments would demand such set-ups to pre-screen any content they do not like. ""Technology companies are rightfully cautious because they are global players, and if they build it for one purpose they don't get to say it can't be used for anything else,"" said Wong, a former Twitter and Google legal executive. ""If you build it, they will come -- it will also be used in China to stop dissidents."" There have been some formal policy changes. Twitter revised its abuse policy to ban indirect threats of violence, in addition to direct threats, and has dramatically improved its speed for handling abuse requests, a spokesman said. ""Across the board we respond to requests more quickly, and it's safe to say government requests are in that bunch,"" the spokesman said. Facebook said it banned this year any content praising terrorists. Google's YouTube has expanded a little-known ""Trusted Flagger"" programme, allowing groups ranging from a British anti-terror police unit to the Simon Wiesenthal Centre, a human rights organisation, to flag large numbers of videos as problematic and get immediate action. A Google spokeswoman declined to say how many trusted flaggers there were, but said the vast majority were individuals chosen based on their past accuracy in identifying content that violated YouTube's policies. No US government agencies were part of the programme, though some non-profit US entities have joined in the past year, she said. ""There's no Wizard of Oz syndrome. We send stuff in and we get an answer,"" said Rabbi Abraham Cooper, head of the Wiesenthal Center's Digital Terrorism and Hate project."

""At least 106 victims have also been traced. Most of them are younger than 12 years,"" it added. Australian police arrested the ringleader, a 33-year-old man only identified as Shannon M. on June 14, 2014 at his Adelaide home, shortly after he logged on to the ""Kidslove"" website under the pseudonym ""NUKE"". Investigators took over the former youth worker's computer to chat to other paedophiles on the TOR encryption network, making them believe that they were talking to ""NUKE"". Shortly afterwards and using NUKE's computer, Dutch police arrested a 37-year-old man in the eastern Dutch city of Almelo. The man, identified as Erwin van den B., 37, is believed to be one of NUKE's fellow ringleaders. ""Dutch and Australian investigators in a short space and after intensive cooperation across several time zones managed to arrest two of the heads of (one of) the world's largest child pornography sites,"" the Volkskrant said. Further arrests followed with the help of the FBI and police shut down the site, which contains some 360,000 illicit images and has a membership of more than 45,000 world-wide. Among 303 arrests so far, at least five are from the Netherlands.  Earlier this month an Australian court sentenced Shannon M. to 35 years in jail.

Maud de Boer-Buquicchio, the UN's special envoy on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, wrote to the Permanent Mission of Japan to the International Organizations in Geneva to say she could not offer hard evidence to support her claim, according to a Japanese official.  ""The letter said after further reviews that there was no official and recent data to support the 13-percent figure,"" Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters.  In her letter, de Boer-Buquicchio vowed not to use the figure in the future and said the number will not be part of a report to be submitted to the UN Human Rights Council, Suga said. ""We regard this explanation as effectively a retraction of the comment over the 13-percent figure,"" he added. ""The Japanese government will continue to ask them to draft reports based on objective data."" In a press conference last month, de Boer-Buquicchio spoke of the Japanese social phenomenon of ""enjo kosai"", often translated as ""compensated dating"", in which older men pay teenage girls for dates that may involve sex. ""Some 13 percent of the school girls in Japan are involved in that kind of activity, which perhaps starts with a relatively innocent activity,"" she said at the briefing. The ""innocent"" behaviour may include men going for a walk with high school girls, she added.  When Japan subsequently demanded that she present evidence for the claim, de Boer-Buquicchio said this month she had ""no official statistics"" on compensated dating.  She said she had seen the figure ""in open sources"". Concerns over the sexualisation of young girls have been frequently expressed by Japanese media, women's groups and some politicians, but the precise extent of abuses or illicit activities has proven difficult to measure.

The Japanese government has censured Maud de Boer-Buquicchio of the United Nations after she suggested 13 percent of schoolgirls in the country were involved in ""paid dating"" The foreign ministry said it had recently informed the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights that the comment, made in Tokyo last month, was ""inappropriate and extremely regrettable"". It is ""unacceptable"" that the envoy cited ""unreliable information"" without a source, the ministry said in a statement Monday. Last month, Maud de Boer-Buquicchio, the UN's special rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, touched on the Japanese social phenomenon of  ""enjo kosai"", often translated as ""compensated dating"", during a press conference.

The spat highlights what has come to be seen as a troubling aspect of the sexualisation of young girls in Japan, in which they are often portrayed in the media in surprisingly suggestive ways that have been largely internalised domestically but that can surprise outsiders. In ""enjo kosai,"" which emerged in the 1990s, older men pay teenage girls for dates which can involve sex, while the expression ""JK"" -- a Japanese-language  abbreviation for high school girls -- refers to more organised and systematic operations in which girls can give massages, lie down next to men or go with them for a stroll. The US State Department last year said in a report that ""enjo kosai... continues to facilitate the prostitution of Japanese children"". In response to the foreign ministry's protest, de Boer-Buquicchio said in a statement that she ""received no official statistic on the scope of the 'JK business' in the country"" during her trip. ""However, many of my interlocutors referred to it as a worrying trend which can easily lead to sexual exploitation of the minors involved in this lucrative business,"" she said.

The students, many of whom are on the football team at Canon City High School, could now face criminal charges, reports said. The school district announced Wednesday that ""a number of our students have engaged in behavior where they take and pass along pictures of themselves that expose private parts of their bodies or their undergarments."" Noting that a ""large number"" of the high school football team players were implicated int he scandal, the district said it was canceling the high school's last football game of the season.

According to The New York Times, police and the district attorney's office are weighing whether to file child pornography charges -- including felony charges -- against some of the participants. Students circulated up to 400 lewd photographs, it added. The police probe is focusing on whether any adults were involved, the school district said.

Molise, 28, was set to be the state's key witness against Frederiksen before she was gunned down outside her house in Maseru, the capital of neighbouring Lesotho, a two-hour drive from Bloemfontein. Police spokesman Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi confirmed Frederiksen faces charges of conspiracy to murder Matseliso, as well as three counts of assault, bigamy, and production and distribution of child pornography. ""The 'conspiracy to murder' charge was confirmed yesterday,"" Mulaudzi told AFP, adding that the charge related to Frederiksen's suspected links to his wife's killing. She had told police she was drugged with laced champagne when she was mutilated. The couple had two children together. When police searched Frederiksen's modest townhouse in Bloemfontein, they discovered more than 10 frozen pieces from the genitals of seven women, as well as pornographic photographs of children, investigators have said. Frederiksen, who has yet to enter a plea, this week appeared at Bloemfontein Magistrates' Court for a bail hearing that was adjourned until next Thursday.

Graphic images of paedophilia in manga comic books remain legal in Japan, despite a new law that criminalises possession of child pornography	 Graphic images of paedophilia in manga comic books remain legal under the new law, which came into effect this summer, while books and videos of real children in sexually provocative poses are still widely available -- and legal. Campaigners had long urged Japan to toughen its stance on child pornography, complaining it was a major source of the material globally. ""When it comes to particular, extreme child pornographic content, manga should be banned,"" Maud de Boer-Buquicchio, the UN's special rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, told reporters as she wrapped up a week-long Japan tour.   But she acknowledged the challenge in ""finding the right balance"" between artistic freedoms and the need to protect children. ""I accept that the freedom of expression argument should outweigh, should prevail when it comes to adult pornography,"" she added. Despite calls for manga imagery to be included in the new rules, there was strong resistance from manga artists, free-speech advocates and publishers, who said it would impinge on freedom of expression and allow authorities to make arbitrary decisions about art. De Boer-Buquicchio criticised the law for being riddled with ""numerous loopholes"" and lashed out at so-called ""child erotica"", saying kids were being exploited. The still-legal offerings feature photos and other materials depicting half-naked children in skimpy outfits, such as tiny bikinis. DVDs or photo books of child erotica are readily available online and at stores in Tokyo including in the city's well-known Akihabara district. ""All these are obviously lucrative businesses. What is worrying is that there is a trend which seems to be socially accepted and tolerated,"" the UN envoy said. Billboards featuring women with voluptuous figures and distinctly child-like faces are also widely seen in urban centres.   - 'Sexual crimes' - Japanese police say they have been cracking down with an 11 percent on-year increase in cases -- a total of 1,828 -- in 2014. Child prostitution has declined in Japan, but materials featuring the abuse of children have proliferated online, the envoy said, as she pointed to poverty, a lack of gender equality, social tolerance and few prosecutions. While Japan is a relatively wealthy country, about 16.3 percent of children aged 17 or under were living in poverty -- meaning a family income half that of the national median -- according to 2012 data.  The UN envoy said impunity for offenders is ""relatively high"" in Japan. ""If these issues can be addressed, I believe Japan can make substantial progress, if not completely eradicate, sexual exploitation of children,"" De Boer-Buquicchio said. Some Japanese non-profit organisations last week issued a formal call to the government to tighten up the new law. ""Materials of children under 18 that were clearly created for the purpose of fulfilling sexual excitement should be regulated as child pornography,"" said Shihoko Fujiwara, head of non-profit organisation Lighthouse. While Lighthouse called on firms to stop distributing DVDs depicting half-naked children several years ago, such images are still widely available, she added. ""We should teach children about sexual crimes at schools,"" she said."

A single path towards ""happiness"", a single roadmap to Thai-style democracy, a single mindset for ""Thainess"", governed by a single internet gateway to ensure only the ""right"" information is consumed by society. Is this really what the junta wants to be remembered for? A digital ""peeping Tom"" looking through the keyhole, and listening in on our most intimate and private conversations. As regards to censorship, what would be the ""right"" kind of information and what would be the ""wrong"" kind outlawed by our internet censorship police? Furthermore, who would be deemed worthy and wise enough to decide what kind of information is appropriate for a society like Thailand? Suppose I asked you to choose one person to have sole authority to censor everything you saw on TV, read in books and viewed online, for all of your life. Who would you allow to have that much control over you? And who would you trust so completely to decide everyday what kind of information was appropriate at each particular juncture? Some of my friends say their wives already wield that kind of authority! But you know what my answer would be? Nobody. I wouldn't allow anybody, not even my parents, to have that much control. Nor would I seek to wield such power over anybody else. The only person good enough, responsible enough, and trustworthy enough, to act as my information police officer, is me. I recognise that as a society, even mature liberal democracies place certain limits on freedom of information and freedom of speech, and for good reason. For example, the possession, distribution and production of child pornography falls outside of the US constitution's first amendment rights pertaining to freedom of speech, and so it should. But in New Zealand, perpetrators caught in the mere act of browsing or the attempt to gain access to child pornography are subject to a federal prison sentence of up to five years. In Great Britain, under the Protection of Children Act, child pornographic material also includes digital images or ""pseudo photographs"", which just about covers all the bases. Censorship doesn't end there. In 1995 US Senator Dianne Feinstein of the Democratic Party helped push through a bill, making it illegal to publish or distribute bomb-making information, a crime punishable by 20 years in a federal facility. Moreover, Senator Feinstein, in her present capacity as Vice Chair of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, is also calling for the total banishment from the internet of countercultural publications like The Anarchist Cookbook. Therefore, I will be the first to admit that censorship can be appropriate, if not absolutely necessary at times. But what is the litmus test we should employ in order to determine these very delicate matters? Well, in my view, the test is a simple but an extremely contentious one. The question we need to ask is, ""Is it in the best interests of the public?"" If the junta had proposed a form of internet cleansing on things we can all agree are totally unacceptable like child pornographic material, DIY bomb-making advice, or violence-inciting websites, I would be the first to applaud Gen Prayut Chan-o-cha for his courage and vision. But this is just not the case. What the premier and the Ministry of ICT are trying to achieve with the single internet gateway is not about the public interest, but rather their own. The ICT Ministry wants to make it easier for the junta to monitor internet traffic, but it's not about catching paedophiles, drug traffickers and terrorists; it's about threats to their own security, which entails cracking down on dissenting opinions. Slowly but surely, an ""Iron Curtain"" is descending on this once free and democratic society. It was far from perfect under Thaksin or Yingluck Shinawatra, and I don't think returning to that is a solution either. However, we are a nation drifting further away from the fire of liberty, blind to the light of reason, and consumed by a dark medieval mindset, which doesn't help create an informed citizenry, a just society or even a country that can thrive and compete with the rest of the modern world. Thailand needs to build bridges, not walls. But instead, this government is obsessed with putting up walls that stifle the free expression of ideas, it has built walls that detrimentally infringe on our civil liberties, and it is plotting to erect a single internet gateway many have dubbed the ""Great Firewall of Thailand"". So to the junta, I would like to invoke Ronald Reagan's immortal words spoken in his powerful speech on June 12, 1987 in Berlin at The Brandenburg Gate. ""General Secretary Gorbachev, if you seek peace, if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union and eastern Europe, if you seek liberalisation, come here to this gate. Mr Gorbachev, open this gate.

""Child porn penalties set to intensify"" -- the front-page headline in last week's Bangkok Post -- is, in my opinion, a step in the right direction. However, my first reaction after reading it was to doubt whether hefty sentences and fines are enough to discourage people from being a part of an industry that makes millions of baht for the masterminds. Too many people stand to lose from eradicating it.   The article went on to tell us that a stricter law carrying longer prison terms will be enforced against anyone possessing or distributing porn materials of those under the age of 18.  In earlier developments, the National Legislative Assembly of Thailand voted unanimously in mid-May to amend the Criminal Code of Thailand to criminalise child pornography. They based this on recommendations from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). The bill recommends five years imprisonment for possession of child pornography, up to seven years for distribution and up to 10 years for production and trade. Fines were doubled to discourage people from getting involved.   I am a firm believer that the laws of the land should be harsh enough and leave few loopholes to dissuade the public from committing a crime, especially as vile as child pornography. However, rules are pointless when there is no effective enforcement.   Trading in child porn has become a lucrative business in Thailand because of corrupt police officers who have been taking backhander payments off vendors for a number of years. However, to convict them is always an uphill task. Informants are too afraid of the ramifications that come with messing with the police, who unfortunately already have a poor reputation with the public. So thick-skinned and blatantly shameful are some corrupt officers that they do not mind receiving kickbacks in broad daylight.     As we welcome new laws that bring to task viewers of child porn, we also need to instigate harsher penalties for any law enforcement officer found to have been involved in the industry. Despite the fact that Thailand has signed the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, Thai children continue to become victims of sexual abuse. Perpetrators are often the people closest to them. Newspapers often run stories on parents that sell their children into prostitution, which I believe eventually leads them to become stuck in the sex industry.      I believe it is imperative to have rigid laws that prosecute parents that decide on using their offspring in this manner. Giving consent to allow your daughter or son to become involved with porn material is a despicable act that should warrant a harsh sentence.     Paedophiles also need to be clamped down on. In the past, possession of child porn material without intent to distribute was not considered a crime under the Criminal Code of Thailand, which inadvertently made the Kingdom a haven for  paedophiles, both Thai and foreign.  I used to watch with disgust, while walking along Silom or Sukhumvit, how DVD porn flicks were sold to customers. From my observations, vendors plying such merchandise singled out male foreigners. Usually abrasive, they could be heard reeling off ""boy on boy, girl on girl, kiddie porn"" in earshot of passers-by. There seems to be a proportion of men who download explicit sexual images of children and then go on to molest them. There is also reasonable data collected through interviews to back up the claim that child sexual offenders frequently sexually exploit youngsters through the creation, distribution and collection of child pornography.  The internet has exacerbated the problem, as viewing of child pornography is more readily accessible. The world was shocked to read about American celebrity Jared Fogle, known as ""The Subway Guy"", confessing his guilt to paying for sex with teens as young as 16 and receiving child pornography. We are shocked by every supposed ""nice guy"" caught with child porn. As a society we have to band together to weed out such characters, but not before seriously clamping down on child porn material.   Yvonne Bohwongprasert is a senior writer for the Life section of the Bangkok Post."

He was 67. DeLuca's death came two years after Subway said he had been diagnosed with leukemia and was scaling back on his leadership role at the company. It also came just weeks after the 50th anniversary of Subway, which is known for its ""Footlong'' sandwiches and says it has more than 44,000 locations around the world. The company traces its roots to 1965, when DeLuca opened a sandwich shop at the age of 17 to help pay for college. The idea came from a family friend, Peter Buck, who was co-founder and provided the $1,000 to start the business. ""I knew nothing about making sandwiches, nor the food industry,'' DeLuca later wrote in a book. DeLuca and Buck opened their first store in Bridgeport, Connecticut under the name ""Pete's Super Submarines,'' with the priciest sub selling for 69 cents. The name was changed to the snappier ""Subway'' in 1968, and the pair decided to fuel growth by franchising, or letting others open Subway stores in exchange for fees. DeLuca: Succumbed to leukemia By 1988, Subway had 2,000 locations. By 1990, it reached the 5,000-store mark. And by 1994, it had more than 8,000 locations. Subway, based in Milford, Connecticut, is privately held and doesn't publicly report its financial performance or executive pay packages. But this year, Forbes magazine pegged DeLuca's net worth at $3.5 billion, making him the 259th-richest individual in the United States. In July 2013, Subway announced that DeLuca had been diagnosed with leukemia. It said DeLuca was in regular contact with his management team, but on a reduced basis as he received treatment. Then earlier this summer, Subway said DeLuca's younger sister, Suzanne Greco, would take over as president and oversee day-to-day operations. DeLuca remained CEO. The company did not immediately say on Tuesday if a successor had been named as CEO. Subway has been facing some recent challenges in addition to DeLuca's health. The company said this summer that it cut ties with longtime pitchman Jared Fogle, who agreed to plead guilty to allegations he paid for sex acts with minors and received child pornography. In addition, some feel Subway has overextended itself with its more than 27,000 US locations. Last year, average sales at established US locations fell 3%, according to Technomic. In his book Start Small Finish Big: Fifteen Key Lessons to Start -- and Run -- Your Own Successful Business, DeLuca recalled living in public housing in the Bronx as a child. His father hadn't graduated high school, but his mother had stressed the importance of education while growing up. After he graduated high school, DeLuca had planned on becoming a doctor. That was why he started the sub shop with Buck -- to support his college education. ""It wasn't intended to support me forever,'' DeLuca wrote. DeLuca is survived by his wife, son and sister, according to Subway, which announced his death on Tuesday. "

The amendment was passed by the National Legislative Assembly and published in the Royal Gazette in preparation for enforcement in December. The amendment follows Thailand's signing of the International Convention on Children's Rights. The materials comprise objects or visual displays, both static and in motion, of sexual acts involving children and people under 18. The displays in question also include portraits and drawings, and files kept in electronic devices, mobile phones and computers.  Anyone receiving the pornographic images from the Line chat application and using them, even for personal sexual entertainment, becomes an offender. The amended law leaves no room for violation of children and the underaged under any circumstances, Mr Sarawut said.  Those who possess pornography showing underaged individuals for personal entertainment purposes are liable for a jail term of up to five years and/or a maximum fine of 100,000 baht.  Forwarding the materials to others is punishable by a jail term of up to seven years and/or a maximum fine of 140,000 baht. Anyone who possesses, distributes or imports the materials with the intent to commercially benefit from the pornography could face 3-10 years imprisonment and a fine of between 60,000-200,000 baht. Dej-Udom Krairit, president of the Lawyers Council of Thailand, said under the amended law, police can file a criminal charge against a suspect without having to wait for the damaged party to lodge a formal complaint."

During the course of meetings with the ministry, Ms McCourt discussed a new initiative — the International Child Protection Certificate (ICPC) — to prevent sexual offenders from the UK travelling to other countries and gaining access to children through teaching or volunteering roles. By last month, the ministry had issued warning letters to public and private schools nationwide, asking them to make it a condition for British nationals applying for teaching jobs to provide the certificate, which acts as a “police check”. But there are serious doubts Thailand can prevent convicted sex offenders from working in schools here. Unlike the UK, which has stringent laws to protect children, the laws governing the employment of foreign teachers are vague and not always enforced. Thai schools operate independently and have autonomy over hiring decisions, raising questions over whether the ministry’s efforts can have any practical effect. “There is no statutory organisation in Thailand for child protection and, historically, we have taken it for granted,” said Teerakiat Jareonsettasin, a vice-minister for education. “I think our system is pretty loose, and, unfortunately, Thai culture looks up to Caucasians and sees them as morally great and rich.” Ejected: Eric Franklin Rosser was training to be a teacher in Bangkok when he was arrested on suspicion of child pornography. His extradition to the US was approved in 2002. EASY ACCESS Eric, 25, has stayed in Thailand for three months and since last month has taught English conversation to Matthayom 1-6 students at a public school in a northern province. The Filipino decided to apply as a teacher on the recommendation of his brother, who teaches at another school in the same province. “They [the school administrators] only asked for a certificate of graduation, transcript, passport and [information about] my work in the Philippines, but there was no interview,” he said. “I think they badly needed a teacher.” On a recent Thursday morning, Eric was at the Teachers' Council of Thailand (TCT) to submit his application for a teacher’s licence, after taking a 10-and-a-half-hour bus trip to Bangkok. “Even if you don’t have a degree, you can teach here as long as you speak English,” said Eric, who holds a bachelor of science in hotel and restaurant management. He is the only foreign teacher at the school and earns a salary of 15,000-20,000 baht, excluding housing. Eric’s case shows just how simple it is to become a foreign teacher in Thailand, where the vast majority of schools won’t even ask an applicant for a police record or check. To obtain a teacher’s licence, however, foreign applicants are required to state whether they have previously been sentenced to jail, or whether they have suffered from “improper behaviour or immorality”. Either of those factors, in the opinion of the TCT, may “bring dishonour upon the profession”. The TCT was unable to provide the exact number of foreign teachers working in Thailand, but said 16,000 people had applied for temporary licences in the past 18 months. On Ajarn Forum, a website for foreign teachers in Thailand, there are dozens of threads on criminal record checks for offences ranging from robbery and drugs to more serious offences. While some are related to the process of obtaining a criminal record check, most are about the probability of being employed at a school despite the conviction. “I was charged and convicted of a serious assault when I was younger. I’m thinking of doing a TEFL course and going to Thailand to teach. Does anyone else have a criminal record in the UK and has it caused any difficulties for you in Thailand?” asked a user under the name “jimmydragon”. Most of the people making comments admitted that while some schools required applicants to declare if they had criminal records, few of the institutions did background checks and many did not even ask. Lead role: Teerakiat Jareonsettasin, a vice-minister for education. THE UK INITIATIVE Criminal record checks are obligatory in the UK — under child protection laws, no person of any nationality can work with children without one. “Once you get convicted for a child sex offence in the UK, you can be assured you can never work with children again,” said Ms McCourt of the NCA, which became operational in the UK in October 2013. But for countries without such stringent child protection measures, the ICPC has been developed as a means of closing the loopholes. In addition to convictions, the certificate includes warnings, reprimands, cautions and “intelligence checks”, with the latter referring to information held by law enforcement which may not have resulted in a conviction. “For example, I might call the police one day and say a person was acting suspiciously outside and was talking to a child,” Ms McCourt said. “If the police found that person and the child made an allegation against them, but had insufficient evidence, the police will hold the information.” If there is a situation of risk, a certificate will not be issued, and the information will be shared with appropriate law enforcement agencies. What decisions are made will be done on a case-by-case basis and schools have to decide what is appropriate. British nationals or any person who has spent time in the UK can apply for the certificate online at www.acro.police.uk, which costs £60 (about 3,250 baht) and takes 10 days to process. The UK monitors people who have been convicted by means of notification orders and restrictions, under which the person must register their address and give notification when they intend to travel overseas. It shares information about people who are judged to be risks to children and have been convicted of certain crimes when it is “necessary to do so”. “We believe that somebody who is a sex offender is always a sex offender … and there is evidence that will tell you if someone commits a child sex offence, they are likely to do so again,” Ms McCourt said. “But we’re not saying that British citizens are any riskier than any other nationality.” The certificate is being used in 74 countries and has been officially launched in Kenya, Thailand, the Philippines, Cambodia, Ukraine, Spain, India and Poland. Since the scheme started in October 2012, 19,000 ICPCs have been issued globally, Ms McCourt said. In Thailand alone, May and June saw a marked increase in the number of ICPCs issued to British nationals. “This means the message is being heard and there are Thai schools clearly wanting to take the responsibility,” Ms McCourt said. Sent home: John Mark Karr, who taught in Thailand, was deported after falsely confessing to murder. A FIRST STEP After the first meeting with UK officials earlier this year, the Education Ministry issued guidelines to more than 30,000 public and private schools, including more than 100 international schools. A letter between the ministry and schools seen by Spectrum said: “There is evidence that those who have been convicted of a child sex offence in the UK tend to seek work opportunities or volunteer work overseas, and many choose to become teachers or other occupations related to children. In order to prevent child sexual abuse, we are asking schools to require British applicants to produce an ICPC certificate.” Attached was an 11-page brochure with information about the certificate, which was produced by the UK’s Association of Chief Police Officers Criminal Records Office and the NCA’s Child Exploitation and Online Protection Command. But there was a problem: schools are deemed as legal entities which have the authority to hire whoever they want and there was initial reluctance to cooperate with the ministry. Some schools which made complaints wanted, out of desperation, to hire teachers as soon as possible, so the ministry provided assistance. “First we were told: ‘Vice-minister, we’re not sure because schools are deemed independent bodies. We can’t tell them what to do and it will be illegal if we make it a requirement.’ So we had to clarify this by saying children’s welfare is paramount,” Dr Teerakiat said. He said the measure was the first step towards stricter requirements not only for foreigners, but also for Thais who apply to be teachers. Thailand has no online system for checking criminal records, and individuals or organisations need to ask for the information from the Royal Thai Police. The initiative is being supported by the Office of the Basic Education Commission’s (Obec) Student Protection Centre, which was established in 2012. Last year, the centre provided assistance to 50,000 students, of which hundreds were cases of sexual abuse; most of the perpetrators were Thai. “Obec is taking this very seriously,” said the centre’s director Thira Bhawangkanantha. “Whoever is found to have sexually assaulted a child will not get away with it.” Mr Thira said while the ICPC is not mandatory and schools have the authority to pick their own foreign teachers, Obec will act on schools which choose to keep teachers with a history of child sex abuse. “Do we need to wait for something to happen first?” he asked. “Yes, they [the teachers] might turn over a new leaf, but we need to lower the risks for our children in all circumstances.” A CULTURE OF COMPLACENCY With a growing number of paedophiles being arrested, Thailand has vowed to toughen its screening processes for foreign teachers. Among the most high-profile cases were the arrests of Eric Rosser and John Mark Karr, both Americans. Rosser was included on the US Federal Bureau of Investigation’s 10 Most Wanted list in connection with child-sex crimes. He worked as a pianist in American star John Mellencamp’s band before coming to Thailand, where he worked at the Mandarin Oriental Bangkok Hotel and gave private piano lessons at his house in Soi Thong Lor. He was arrested in February 2001 after a tip-off from the FBI.Karr managed to find teaching jobs in Bangkok before he was arrested and extradited in 2006. He falsely confessed to the murder of beauty pageant contestant JonBenet Ramsey. The Education Ministry has conducted qualification checks on 7,000 foreign applicants for teaching jobs during the past year, and none were found to have a criminal record. The response from officials, said Dr Teerakiat, shows a general lack of understanding among Thais on the issue of child protection. While organisations such as the Centre for the Protection of Children’s Rights Foundation and the Pavena Foundation exist, Thailand has no statutory body for child protection. “Surveillance and asking them to keep a close eye on suspects — we don’t have that system. It’s a big issue in Western countries and when I look back Thailand is a bit complacent,” Dr Teerakiat said. “You can say we take it for granted, and I think they [foreigners] take advantage of this lack of knowledge, kind of seeing them as civilised people.” He warned schools which do not act on teachers with a history of child sex abuse are putting children at risk. “It’s not about treatment such as trying to quit smoking; we’re talking about the risk towards children,” said Dr Teerakiat, who worked as a child psychiatrist in the UK for almost 20 years. “You can’t use the excuse that the person can ‘recover’, because it’s not something that should be given an opportunity.” MAKE IT A REQUIREMENT While there have not yet been any concrete measures to enforce stricter background checks on foreign teachers, the Education Ministry says it would welcome the introduction of a system similar to other countries. “If your country is more stringent in detecting these people, obviously they are going to seek kids elsewhere,” Dr Teerakiat said. The US Embassy says it can help people who ask for criminal record checks, which can be supplied by the FBI for $18. The process takes about six weeks. “There is no way that will ever guarantee that a paedophile is not working at your school. But what you can guarantee is a convicted paedophile is not working at your school,” said a US Embassy official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “You can guarantee they’re not convicted.” Applicants can sign a waiver that authorises the school to obtain a background criminal record. Unlike the UK certificate, the FBI only gives a criminal history and does not provide information about ongoing investigations. Information on anyone in the US who boards an international flight is run through a number of databases. If someone has a conviction for crimes against children, US security officials in the destination country will be alerted, as part of Operation Angel Watch. The US has a Department of Homeland Security office in Thailand which would be notified. They would then evaluate the crime and provide open-source information to Thai immigration authorities, who can do what they deem appropriate. “People [with convictions are] coming here, absolutely, and Thai police take it very seriously. We partner with police daily,” the official said. “We definitely have arrested people who have been working at a school, but not any more than Cambodia or Guatemala.” In the past six years, the embassy has helped with the arrests of four Americans teaching at schools, the source said, adding that paedophilia has one of the highest recidivism rates of any crime. While the US criminal records cover only people who have been convicted of crimes in the US, a lot of international teachers move from country to country and it’s up to the school to ask the applicant to provide information from other countries. “The worry that sex offenders might be working in schools can be solved by making it a requirement for applicants to provide a criminal record,” the official said. “And it’s up to Thailand and the school if they will allow the person to work there.” n Foreigners can request temporary teaching permits — lasting two years and extendable for up to six years — provided they meet the following qualifications: 1. They are aged over 19. 2. Under Section 44 (B) of the 2003 Teachers and Educational Personnel Council Act they must not have the following “prohibited personal attributes”: a. Improper behaviour or immorality. b. Being an incompetent or quasi-incompetent person. c. If they have been imprisoned, the sentence, in the opinion of the Teachers' Council of Thailand (TCT), brings dishonour to the profession. 3. If the person granted permission to teach violates professional ethics or does not satisfy the professional development standards, conditions and methods specified by the TCT, the person’s permission to teach shall be revoked.

The first ever trial of a former papal official accused of paedophile crimes is to open at the Vatican in what is viewed as belated Church efforts to battle child abusers among the clergy	 The unprecedented trial will hear the case of former Polish archbishop Jozef Wesolowski, who is accused of possessing child pornography in Rome in 2013-14, and the sexual abuse of minors during his 2008-13 stint as the Vatican nuncio, or ambassador, in the Dominican Republic. Wesolowski, 66, was secretly recalled from his posting in 2012 after the Church hierarchy was informed that he was regularly paying young Dominican boys for sexual services. He was defrocked by a Church court in June 2014 but remained free until September of that year, when he was placed under house arrest -- reportedly for reasons of failing health -- under an order the Vatican said came directly from Pope Francis. His trial marks the first legal proceedings against a church official under a Vatican justice system update by Francis in response to accusations of sexual abuse of children by priests that have multiplied as thousands of victims have spoken out around the world. If Wesolowski is convicted in the trial, in which the judge, defence lawyer and prosecutors are all Italian lay people, he could face a six-year prison sentence -- more if aggravated circumstances are found -- which he could serve in Vatican detention facilities.    - Test case -   He is seen as a test case in Francis's push to take a more active role in prosecuting predators in the face of accusations from abuse victims, their families and supporters that the Catholic Church has not done enough to identify and punish paedophiles in its midst. ""The (pornography) case is based on an offence introduced to Vatican legislation by Francis in 2013. The other involves sexual abuse of minors prosecuted on the case assembled by legal authorities of Santo Domingo,"" the Vatican said in a statement ahead of the trial. ""These serious allegations will be scrutinised by the competent judicial body, which will be assisted by both technical appraisals of the IT systems used by the defendant and, if necessary, international legal cooperation for the evaluation of testimonial evidence from the competent authorities in Santo Domingo,"" it said. According to the Italian-language weekly Panorama, the tribunal may request testimony from Dominican deacon Francisco Javier Occi Reyes, who was arrested in Santo Domingo accused of having put Wesolowski in contact with minors. The first day of the proceedings will be open to the public, and the trial is then expected to recess before reconvening in September. At that time Wesolowski's lawyers may motion for it to continue in closed session.  While the case marks the first time a Vatican court will hear child sexual abuse charges against a former Church official, it is not the first time its legal process has been used to hear charges of alleged wrong-doing. In 2012 the Vatican tribunal drew world-wide attention when it heard a case against Paolo Gabriele, Pope Benedict's former personal butler, for accusations he leaked secret documents to the press.

The draft agreement marks an important step in the EU's plan to overhaul the continent's digital market to boost growth and catch up with the United States and Asia. ""Under the agreement, roaming surcharges in the European Union will be abolished as of June 15, 2017,"" Latvia, which holds the rotating EU presidency, said in a statement after 12 hours of talks between it and EU lawmakers. The deal will require approval from the European Parliament and EU member states, some of whom have been pushing for roaming charges to be abolished in December 2018. Eastern European countries have feared that operators might hike domestic prices if roaming charges are removed prematurely, while countries with a lot of tourists, such as Spain and Greece, have benefited from higher prices. The delay has angered consumer  rights groups who say member states are defending the interests of their national operators. In an interim move, roaming charges will drop in April 2016, with maximum surcharges of €0.05 ($0.056) per minute of a call or megabyte of data and €0.02 per text sent. That will make the maximum roaming charge about 75% cheaper than under current tariff caps. The European Commission has been setting caps on roaming prices since 2007 and says that retail prices for cross-border calls, texts and data have fallen by more than 80% and for data by up to 91%. On the issue of net neutrality, the EU plans to order telecoms operators to treat all internet traffic equally and that blocking would only be allowed for clear reasons, such as counter cyber attacks or child pornography. Companies such as Deutsche Telekom, Orange and Telecom Italia had lobbied to have more leeway to tap into a potentially lucrative source of revenue, but internet activists say this could create a two-speed Internet that benefits companies with deep pockets. The rules could benefit start-ups that showcase their business or sell on the internet and need to be able to compete on an equal footing with larger players. The latter would not be able to pay for privileged access to end-users. ""The access to a start-up's website will not be unfairly slowed down to make way for bigger companies. No service will be stuck because it does not pay an additional fee to iInternet service providers. There won't be gatekeepers to decide what you can and cannot access,"" the commission said. The common EU-wide internet rules are to enter force in all 28 members on April 30, 2016. reuters"

The US Department of Justice said that Ronny Lee Waldrip received a 262-month sentence on Thursday in federal court in Honolulu. Waldrip, 64, from Douglasville, Georgia, was arrested when he arrived in Honolulu with a laptop computer containing sexually explicit photos and videos of minors. He pleaded guilty last year to one count of sexual exploitation of a minor outside the United States. He was also ordered to pay US$45,000 in restitution to his victims. Further details were not available. According to a plea agreement, Waldrip used a hidden camera to record his sexual acts with 14- and 15-year-old girls in Thailand, where he admitted he had travelled on numerous occasions to have sex with underage girls. He also admitted that, on Feb 13, 2012, he travelled from Bangkok to Honolulu with a laptop computer containing images and videos of child pornography, including videos of him engaging in sexual acts with the victims. Waldrip further admitted to using the internet to distribute the images and videos to another US citizen interested in child pornography. The case was brought before the US courts as part of Project Safe Childhood, a Justice Department programme launched in 2006 to combat child sexual exploitation and abuse.

Pope Francis has accepted the resignation of two US bishops	 The two US bishops' resignations follow the 2012 jailing of Minnesota priest Curtis Wehmeyer for the sexual abuse of minors he preyed on during camping trips and possession of child pornography. Wehmeyer's conviction led to the archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis being charged on June 5 with six counts of failing to protect minors after prosecutors unveiled substantial evidence that senior Church officials failed to act on repeated warnings from parents and others that the priest was a danger to children. No individuals have been charged but the two clerics who have stepped down, Archbishop John Clayton Nienstedt and Auxiliary Bishop Lee Anthony Piche, were both named in the complaint as having failed to heed the warnings. A former papal ambassador to the Dominican Republic will be tried for paedophilia next month in the first case of its kind to be brought before a Vatican court. The first hearing in the trial of Jozef Wesołowski has been scheduled for July 11, 2015.

Both are using the Ashley Madison cheating website, which is making a lucrative, controversial splash in South Korea in the wake of a landmark ruling earlier this year that decriminalises adultery. So great is the interest here that company executives expect it to become a top-three market globally for them in five years, after the United States and Canada. Ashley Madison's Korean website is shown on a computer screen in Seoul, South Korea. (AP photo) Executives say a large number of women are signing up, taking advantage of increasing access to disposable cash and the freedom to do what men have always done. Not all is equal, however: the consequences of getting caught remain much greater for women than they are for men. Here is a look at how the cheating website's debut shows hints of both change and persistent sexism in this traditionally conservative country. Ashley Madison, which operates in 46 countries and has 36 million members, launched here in April 2014, and within the first two weeks more than 50,000 people had signed up. Then South Korea shut down the website, citing a six-decade-old anti-adultery law. It was not a shocking move for a country that bars people from viewing pornography or reading rival North Korea's propaganda-filled media, but Ashley Madison sued. Then, in February, a court separately struck down the anti-adultery law. The ban was lifted, and Ashley Madison again took off. In its first two weeks after reopening, more than 100,000 new members signed up, generating US$400,000 (13 million baht) in revenue. Ashley Madison is seen as the first company in South Korea to aggressively promote itself as a dating website for married people, though other online dating websites and chatting services have long been used as channels for affairs or prostitution. Among the surprises, the company says, is that more women than men under the age of 45, its most lucrative group, have signed up. ""Men have always had affairs,"" Paul Keable, a company spokesman, said. ""The problem for women is that the consequences have been much graver."" ""Women have a greater economic level and independence than they had previously, so they're able to access the thing they've always wanted but could never do before. That's what you're seeing in Korea."" A 34-year-old Southeast Asian woman in Seoul who has been married to a Korean man for five years has had plenty of online conversations with Korean men on Ashley Madison but has arranged only one meeting in person. The woman has also been chatting with an American with a Korean wife who lives in Hawaii but makes regular visits to the country. She refused to give her name because she said exposure would mean divorce and losing her two young children. The woman, who lives in central Seoul, has not cheated yet, she said, because she has not found the right person. ""This is the perfect way to see if he's out there,"" she said. She wants ""a side relationship within my relationship"". She said things are generally OK with her husband, but she craves more attention. ""I don't really want to change the situation I'm in now; I just want to add some spice. I want to have someone to whom I could retreat to for a short time before I go back to reality."" Successful men caught cheating usually suffer no career setbacks and often stay married, said Cho Kyung-ae, a senior counsellor at the Korea Legal Aid Centre for Family Relations, an independent charity that has provided legal and marriage counselling for more than 150,000 couples or families. For a woman, however, the damage is ""irreparable"" - huge social stigma that can include the loss of not only her job but her family, Ms Cho said. ""Society's view is: 'How could someone's wife dare to do that? Isn't she ashamed as a mother?'"" Ms Cho said. Although the Korean media have been mildly critical of Ashley Madison starting its business here, adultery is increasingly talked about publicly. For instance, a popular Korean soap opera centres on an affair between a middle-aged married woman and a younger man. Min Hong-chul, a lawmaker for the New Politics Alliance for Democracy party, recently proposed in parliament to allow censors greater leeway in blocking ""harmful information,"" which could pave the way for stopping internet and other media - such as the Ashley Madison site - that Mr Min says are undermining family values. The bill proposal will likely enjoy strong conservative support but its prospects are uncertain. Mr Min said South Korea's traditional values began to erode during the 1980s, which saw a meteoric economic rise and the widespread acceptance of more permissive Western ideas. While this brought wealth and greater human rights, it also led to one of the highest divorce rates among developed countries, he said. A man who would seem to have it all - a well-paid chief executive job and a beautiful wife and child - is looking for what he says he lacks through Ashley Madison. The man, who also refused to be named because he is worried about the repercussions of using an adultery dating site, said he loves his wife but cannot remember the last time he had sex with her. After eight years of marriage, she is consumed with their child, he said, and is too tired for sex. He said that when she is still asleep in the morning and he gets no breakfast before work, he feels like he is nothing but ""a machine that makes money"". From his office computer, he exchanges messages with women on the Ashley Madison site that include sexual jokes, complaints about his wife and worries about his sex life. He recently had sex with a woman he met on the site. He said he also gave her some money, after she tearfully said she struggled to buy baby food. He feels sorry for his wife because of the cheating, he said by phone. ""But if you look at it in a different way, it does reduce friction with her. When she refuses to sleep with me because she's too tired, my ego hurts."" If he caught his wife having an affair, however, he would divorce her. His feeling, he said, would be: ""How could you cheat on me when I've made so much money [for the family]?"" "

Jemimah Kansiime, known as AKA ""Panadol wa bassajja"" or ""medicine for men"", pictured in Kampala on April 17, 2015	 The 21-year old singer, who uses the stage name ""Panadol wa Basajja"" -- literally, ""medicine for men"" -- has already spent five weeks in jail after her arrest for a music video that gives a lingering and generous focus on wet and soapy buttocks. Now she faces up to 10 years in jail, if found guilty in the first full trial under the law -- which took effect in February 2014 -- that critics such as Human Rights Watch argue so loosely defines pornography it has encouraged public attacks on women wearing skimpy clothing. Critics say it is part of a growing anti-liberal movement including tough laws against homosexuals in Uganda, where religious-driven conservatism appears to be on the rise and where US evangelical preachers rather than pop stars like Kansiime often receive rock star welcomes. ""I was aware that there are some sections of society that are conservative,"" said the singer, smoothing her rainbow coloured hair extensions that always cover one eye. But one thing she thought she had learnt from her idols -- including Rihanna and Nicki Minaj -- is that sex sells. ""I was just experimenting to see if I put on a short dress, will the audience like it?"" said the singer. She made the video that has placed her in hot water last year for her song ""Nkulinze"" -- or ""I am waiting for you"" -- about ""a young lover's intimate fantasies"". It has proved popular, and the video has been watched over 140,000 times on YouTube. But Kansiime said she never dreamt that writhing in her underwear was breaking the law. She and her then manager Didi Muchwa Mugisha were arrested in November. Mugisha pleaded guilty and was fined 200,000 Ugandan shillings (75 dollars, 60 euros), but Kansiime pleaded not guilty, and was held for five weeks before raising the cash bail. ""When I was making that video I never intended it for children, I intended it for adults. I did not sell or distribute the song,"" said Kansiime, wearing a short, leopard print dress with tiny straps, revealing a push up bra underneath. ""My rights have been trampled upon, my freedom of expression has been trampled upon,"" she told AFP in her simple tin-shack home in the capital Kampala. - Shocked minister - Her lawyer, Isaac Semakadde, argues the case is a test for the right of Ugandan performers to ""express themselves"". ""That right to erotic entertainment, there has to be a space for it in an open and free society,"" he told AFP, saying divisions must be made between clearly criminal offences such as child pornography. ""To ban all forms of pornography, all forms of nudity, is outrageous,"" he said. She was tracked down and arrested after Ethics Minister Simon Lokodo was shocked at the video. Lokodo has recently boasted that he and his ""intelligence team"" of spies are ""on the ground"" watching such singers closely. ""That's why Panadol was arrested,"" he said, describing her videos as ""very obscene and vulgar"", and warning of more arrests. The former priest said singers such as Rihanna were ""the type of people I'm condemning."" ""She's a very provocative dancer... there's nothing at all good there,"" he said. In his continued crackdown on pornography, Lokodo has this year ordered police to arrest men who procure prostitutes and described a popular local television dating show as prostitution. Local media reported that he also confronted Uganda's youngest MP when she walked into parliament in a short skirt. Semakadde accuses the ethic ministry of ignoring more pressing issues. ""The decadence in society does not start and stop with prostitution,"" he said. ""There's corruption - but they have no answers to that, so they go for the most vulnerable."" Kansiime is due next in court later this month.

Pattara Khampitak, president of the Press Council of Thailand, said the expected decrease in income accounts for about one-tenths of all advertising booked in the media industry. The issue arose at a Thai Journalists Association seminar which was discussing three core provisions, Sections 48-50, in the draft charter. Section 48 says the state is prohibited from providing grants, property or other benefits as subsidies to privately-owned media. A specific law would be needed to regulate buying of advertising or services from them. Mr Pattara said media professionals called for a law to regulate state spending on advertising and public relations amid concerns over a lack of transparency and abuse of funds. Manich Suksomchitra, a member of the National Reform Council and a charter drafter, said the provision is not meant to harm the media, but taxpayers' money should not be spent to raise the profile of politicians or in any way that does not benefit the public. Also widely discussed at the seminar is a provision that requires promulgation of a law to set up a professional mass media organisation. The body will protect media independence and strengthen ethics and standards. However, concerns are being raised the organisation may meddle with press freedom.  Mr Manich said the organisation is intended to keep media outlets in check and ensure their accountability, as existing organisations cannot. Suwanna Raksasombatsuk, manager of Chulalongkorn University Radio, said media outlets must be required to register with a professional organisation which will play a supervisory role and impose sanctions on those who violate regulations. She said outsiders should also be brought in to help. Meanwhile, the National Legislative Assembly yesterday passed a draft amendment to the Criminal Code to deal with distribution of child pornography. The maximum jail sentence increased from seven to 10 years for those who violate the law."

An Australian man has been charged with 145 sex offences against at least 28 children, including rape, after allegedly using social media to groom them. Police claim the 47-year-old from Warwick, southwest of Brisbane, Queensland, used several aliases online -- including Jazz, Jazzman and David Bourne -- to prey on children under the age of 16. His alleged crimes, including making and distributing child pornography, were committed between 2002 to 2015, and involved victims in Australia. Police claim he asked the children for indecent photos and then used them to extort and in some cases rape, film and photograph them. Detective Senior Constable Russell Joyce told the Warwick Daily News that a complaint was made in April last year, which sparked a lengthy investigation to track down victims. ""The reactions when we have found them have been everything from embarrassment to shock and in some respects, relief,"" he said. ""We are still going and we believe there are more victims out there."" Joyce added: ""The Internet is where the kids are these days and it is so hard for parents to keep track of what they're doing."" Queensland Police Minister Jo-Ann Miller urged parents to closely monitor their children's online activity, giving warning that sex offenders are skilled at using technology to prey on them. ""It's not good enough to say you don't understand Facebook or you can't work out how to use an iPhone,"" she said. ""You need to learn about what your children are using so you can guide, assist and supervise their use."" The man, who was not named, was remanded in custody until July 20."

The announcement was made at Government House yesterday in the presence of Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwon, deputy national police chief Ek Angsananon, the chiefs of the armed forces and more than 529 provincial governors and representatives of relevant agencies. Human trafficking must be tackled seriously with a concerted effort, and those who resist or demand benefits must have no place in society and will have to be punished, Gen Prayut said. ""Officials linked to [trafficking offences must be fired and evidence compiled to lay criminal charges, not just disciplinary penalties, against them,"" the premier said. Civil servants must focus on the national interest and superiors must inform their subordinates not to abuse their authority, he said, adding that officials must adhere to good governance. Gen Prayut said the government will concentrate on suppressing human trafficking as the problem occurs inside and outside the country. The prime minister said authorities had to get tough on prostitution and child beggars. Though the issue has been public knowledge for more than a decade, insufficient efforts have been made to tackle the problem, he said. He said measures to tackle the issue are still not systematic, adding that prostitution is also caused by social inequality and poverty and that relevant agencies must find ways to create better jobs for the poor. The premier said he has drawn up a time frame for authorities to crack down on prostitution and beggars at Talad Thai market in Pathum Thani within a month. To tackle human trafficking, the government will ramp up the registration of about 1.6 million migrant workers, he said. The administration will also find ways to return Thai workers stranded in other countries, including on Ambon Island in Indonesia and in Somalia. He said migrant workers must not be taken advantage of in Thailand. The root of the problems must be solved, he said. For example, entertainment venues must not operate past the legal time of 2am, adding that law enforcement must also toughen up on obscene material. ""Don't cite the impact on tourism. They [crimes] must be strictly dealt with, including pornography,"" he said.   The Foreign Ministry, meanwhile, will be told to create better understanding among foreigners and take care of Thai workers abroad, he noted. Gen Prawit, who is also defence minister, said provincial governors and police commanders must be aware of the government's policy. He insisted that they must discuss ways to stop human trafficking in their areas. The problem now also rests with officers, including those near national borders, he said. Gen Prawit said superiors must inform lower-ranking officials about the problem. He also asked governors to tackle both human trafficking and drug smuggling. Provincial governors and police must also play a key role in contacting business operators to address the issue, the deputy premier said. Officials at border checkpoints and those who grant work permits to migrant labourers must work together while governors have to invite relevant agencies for talks to hammer out clear directives for tackling trafficking. ""Governors are the provincial chiefs who have to supervise subordinates in their provinces and take care of all labour-related agencies,"" Gen Prawit said. Interior Minister Anupong Paojinda admitted some officials may be linked to trafficking by collecting money from networks, and that governors must look into the matter. He also raised seven anti-human trafficking measures to be followed by governors. Workers from Laos, Myanmar and Cambodia must be documented at provincial registration centres and the registration of fishery workers must be sped up in the 22 coastal provinces, he said. The right status must be given to the ethnic minority populace and the stateless who have been in Thailand for a long time, he added. Emphasis will also be placed on preventing people from entering the country illegally. Local human trafficking networks must be located and intelligence obtained to go after the masterminds who are funding these networks, he added."

Japanese authorities are investigating a worker at Amazon's local unit over claims he was involved in the sale of child pornography, reports say	 The unidentified man, reportedly in his forties, posted a graphic picture book for sale that showed nude girls believed to be under 18, Jiji Press news agency and the Asahi newspaper reported, citing police sources. The temporary distribution worker, who was dispatched to work at Amazon Japan Logistics, an affiliate of the Japanese arm of Amazon.com, was in charge of product management and distribution, the reports said. A customer who purchased the book online returned it and complained that the book appeared to be child pornography, but the employee re-listed it on the online store, they added. As part of their investigation, prosecutors are eyeing another man allegedly involved in the book's sale, Jiji said. Neither police nor Amazon Japan would confirm the reports, but the Internet retailer said it was ""cooperating fully with the authorities."" ""We have regulations that any products posted on the Amazon website for sale must comply with Japanese laws,"" the company said in a statement. The case comes after police reportedly discovered that about 10 arrested child-porn vendors had put up nude photo books and other similar material on Amazon Japan's website. Local media said authorities raided the head office of Amazon Japan K.K. and a distribution centre near Tokyo in January.  Japan has a large porn industry, and visitors are sometimes shocked by the ubiquity of sexual imagery and the huge volume of material available. However, in June last year, Japan fell into line with other major developed countries and banned the possession of child pornography, but the sometimes graphic paedophilic images in manga comic books remained legal. Campaigners had long urged Japan to toughen its stance on child pornography, complaining it was a major source of the material for global markets.    "

The delegation hopes the meetings with lobbyists, business leaders and state officials will help upgrade Thailand from the lowest ranking of the US Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report. Phumin Harinsut, vice-chairman of the Thai Chamber of Commerce, said representatives of the chamber and state agencies led by the Foreign Ministry would explain Thailand's progress in handling foreign workers and child labourers. The group will return next Wednesday. ""We're quite optimistic that what we've done will be enough to convince the US to remove Thailand from the lowest ranking,"" Mr Phumin said. The US State Department last June downgraded Thailand to its lowest status, Tier 3, for not fully complying with minimum standards for the elimination of human trafficking. After being listed as Tier 2 for four years, Thailand joined Syria, Iran, North Korea and 17 other nations in Tier 3. The TIP report contains no mechanism for imposing trade barriers but says any US opposition to assistance for foreign governments must exclude trade-related assistance. The report could still affect certain funding channels, as the US could pressure global financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank not to lend to Thailand. The allegations in the report centre on the shrimp, fish, sugar-cane, garment and pornography industries. Thailand's shipments to the US were worth 768 billion baht last year, making up 10.5% of exports. Mr Phumin said Thai seafood and canned food would be hit especially hard if the US ruled to keep Thailand at its lowest ranking in the 2015 report. ""Although the US has not banned Thai exports in light of Tier 3, the private sector is afraid of other barriers,"" he said, adding that the report had damaged the country's export image. The Thai Chamber of Commerce has set up a special task force to study the labour issue and map out a plan for all related parties to pursue a concerted effort to tackle labour problems and human trafficking allegations. Thai officials are set to fly to Brussels next month to discuss migrant worker issues with the foreign business community."

National Security Agency Director Adm. Mike Rogers speaks about cyber security at The New America Fondations cyber security conference at the Ronald Reagan building February 23, 2015, in Washington, DC Admiral Michael Rogers told a Washington cybersecurity forum that he does not believe Americans should be divided on the issue of encryption -- which makes it nearly impossible for outside parties to gain access, even in some cases with a warrant. Rogers endorsed the view expressed by FBI director James Comey on gaining access to encrypted mobile devices as necessary for law enforcement. Comey last year warned that law enforcement could be hampered in critical investigations after Apple and Google said they would encrypt their smartphones and give users the keys, making it impossible to hand over data even with a court order. ""Most of the debate I've seen is that it's either all or nothing, that it's either total encryption or no encryption at all,"" Rogers said. Rogers said it should be feasible to ""come up with a legal framework that enables us within some quasi-process to address... valid concerns if I have indications to believe that this phone, that this path is being used for criminal, or in my case, foreign intelligence or national security issues."" The NSA chief called for the same kind of cooperation used to fight child pornography and exploitation, where tech firms report potential criminals to authorities. ""We have shown in other areas that through both technology and a legal framework and a social compact that we can take on tough issues, and I hope we can do the same thing here,"" he said. - Regaining trust - Rogers said the NSA needs to be able to carry out its mission as well as regain trust of the American public. ""This simplistic characterization that one side is good and one side is bad is a terrible place for us to be as a nation. We have got to come to grips with some really hard fundamental questions."" The NSA has come under intense scrutiny both at home and abroad after former contractor Edward Snowden leaked documents about government surveillance programs that sweep up vast amounts of data from Internet and phone communications. Rogers declined to comment on the latest reports from last week that the NSA implanted spyware on commercially made hard drives, and that it worked with British intelligence to hack into the world's biggest maker of SIM cards to be able to access mobile communications. ""We fully comply with the law,"" Rogers said. ""We do that foreign intelligence mission operating within (a legal) framework."" But Rogers appeared to have a hard time persuading some in the audience who argued that giving encryption keys to the NSA would weaken security and could force US firms to give the same access to foreign governments. Alex Stamos, the chief information security officer for Yahoo, asked Rogers whether ""we should be building defects into the encryption in our products,"" saying these would be ""backdoors or golden master keys for the US government."" Rogers said he disliked the term ""backdoor,"" saying it should be a transparent mechanism with legal supervision. Bruce Schneier, chief technology officer at the security firm Resilient Systems said the government request for access reprises an effort by the US in the 1990s to gain access to Internet encryption keys. The effort was abandoned in the face of opposition from tech firms. Whether it is software or hardware, Schneier told AFP, ""nobody would want this. Someone in France is not going to buy something if there is a framework for (NSA) access."""

The NLA held a meeting on Thursday to deliberate an amendment to the Criminal Code to toughen the nation's stance against child pornography. According to the bill, child porn is against basic children's rights in accordance with the convention on the rights of the child, Ms Jintanun said. She said while the reproduction of adult porn violates the Criminal Code, it was reasonable to introduce tough measures regarding child pornography. According to the bill, the definition of child porn will be listed in ""Section 1"" of the Criminal Code, describing violations of the legislation. People who possess pornography involving young people aged between 15 and 18 will face a fine up to 30,000 baht and/or a jail term up to three years, according to the bill. Violators who have pornographic image of children aged under 15 in their possession will face a fine up to 100,000 baht and/or a jail term up to five years. People who produce pornography of young people aged under 18 for sale whether it be in the country or for export will face a fine up to 140,000 baht and/or a jail term up to seven years. Eight years ago, authorities attempted to introduce child pornography legislation to help protect young children with about 20,000 people signing a petition supporting the legislation but lawmakers did not pass it, Ms Jintanun said. Pornpetch Wichitchonchai, who chaired the NLA meeting yesterday, said it was acceptable for an NLA member to propose a bill to the NLA committee since this was in accordance with the constitution's Section 14, Paragraph 5.     Mr Pornpetch said the NLA would have to allow the government to study the bill before the members cast their votes.

Former rock star Gary Glitter arrives at Southwark Crown Court in central London on February 5, 20 where he was later found guilty of sex abuse against young girls Glitter, 70, whose real name is Paul Gadd, was convicted of one count of attempted rape, four counts of indecent assault and one count of sexual intercourse with a girl under the age of 13 between 1977 and 1980. The jury of five men and seven women acquitted Gadd of three other counts after deliberating for two days at the end of a two-week trial. The entertainer blew kisses at the public gallery as he was led away to the cells. Glitter was at the height of his fame as a singer-songwriter and musician when he attacked his victims, and investigators said he targeted young girls who were in awe of him. Prosecutor John Price had earlier described how a drunken Gadd had tried to force himself on a girl, who was aged under 10 at the time, in the mid-1970s. The victim only came forward 20 years after the incident when she saw Gadd had admitted in 1999 to child pornography charges. He also attacked two girls, aged 12 and 13, after inviting them to his dressing room without their mothers. One victim, now in her 50s, told the court how Glitter, smelling of ""booze and cigarettes"", had put his arm over her, making her feel ""uncomfortable"". Chief Crown Prosecutor Baljit Ubhey said Gadd had ""abused his access to young fans in order to give himself the opportunities to assault and abuse his victims. ""The bravery of the victims and other witnesses in this case cannot be understated and their testimony has been vital in bringing Paul Gadd to justice."" The singer was first jailed in 1999 when he admitted possessing 4,000 images of child pornography. He was deported from Cambodia in 2002 over unspecified claims and convicted in Vietnam in 2006 of sexually abusing two girls, for which he was sentenced to three years in jail. On returning to Britain, Glitter was placed on the Sex Offenders Register for life. - String of scandals - Glitter shot to fame in the 1970s and had over 20 hit singles including ""I'm the Leader of the Gang (I Am)"", ""I Love You Love Me Love"" and ""Come On Come In Get On"". He will be sentenced on February 27 and the nature of his offences means he is likely to face a lengthy jail term. Peter Watt, from children's charity the NSPCC, accused the singer of being ""devious and manipulative throughout this trial."" ""Thankfully the jury has seen through all the fake tears, and his attempts to paint his victims as liars, gold diggers or opportunistic fantasists,"" he added. Investigators said other information had been received during the trial, and that it was being assessed. Glitter is the latest in a series of high profile people in Britain to be convicted of historical sex abuse. He was arrested as part of the Metropolitan Police's Operation Yewtree, launched in the wake of historic sex abuse claims against late BBC star Jimmy Savile, now thought to have been a prolific sex offender. The investigation has already seen former radio DJ Dave Lee Travis, Australian entertainer Rolf Harris and celebrity publicist Max Clifford convicted of sexual offences. The government has launched a wide-ranging inquiry into how sexual abuse allegations were handled in the wake of a string of scandals involving child abuse at hospitals, care homes, churches and schools. The probe will include a review of allegations of a ring of paedophiles in powerful political positions, rumours that first circulated in the 1980s but that resurfaced following the Savile case."

They relate to computers, cybersecurity, personal data, information technology and telecommunications. Among them is the Bill to Amend the Computer Crimes Act, which proposes several changes to the existing law. Some of these changes, however, may be cause for concern. Following on from last week's article, which focused on the changes being introduced by the Cybersecurity Bill, this article will address the proposed changes to the Computer Crimes Act. Certain changes proposed by the bill are organisational in nature, accounting for the creation of the Ministry of Digital Economy and Information Technology, as well as the new National Cybersecurity Committee. Sections on who has the authority to act under the Computer Crimes Act and confidentiality obligations would also be expanded. As for operative provisions, there are adjustments to penalties for several of the computer-related offences in the Act, which are meant to reflect their relative seriousness. There is also an entirely new section dealing with child pornography. Another notable change is an amendment that expands the circumstances in which a court can be petitioned to block dissemination of content. All of these amendments are important, but Sections 11, 14, and 26 are particularly noteworthy. Section 11 currently provides that any person sending computer data or electronic mail to another person and covering up the source of such data in a manner that disturbs the normal operation of the other person's computer system shall be subject to a fine. The amendment would add an element to the offence, i.e., that the sender fails to provide an opportunity for the recipient to cancel or reject the unwanted data or electronic mail. The amendment also envisages that the minister would promulgate regulations on sending such data and email, and require compliance. This would provide a means of fighting spam email and messages, and depending on the content of the ministerial regulations, perhaps online marketers would be required to provide an opt-out or possibly an opt-in mechanism. While some online marketers may have concerns, in general, this is a much-welcomed change. A change has also been proposed to Section 14, which addresses service provider liability. The current wording provides that any service provider intentionally supporting or consenting to particular offences within a computer system under its control shall be subject to the same penalty as the person committing the offence. Section 14 has long worried service providers all over Thailand, as it left open the possibility that they could be held liable for content posted by their customers or service users. The bill would potentially lessen these concerns by providing for the minister to promulgate regulations on actions to be taken by service providers in preventing the dissemination of objectionable computer data, and for the minister to order the destruction of particular computer data. In line with this, under the amended Section 14, if the service provider proves that it followed such instructions of the minister, the service provider would not be liable. Assuming the ministerial regulations are sensible, this has the potential to be quite beneficial in limiting liability not only for internet service providers but also for all others that are deemed ""service providers"" under the law. In addition, a change has been proposed with respect to data retention obligations. Under Section 26 of the current law, computer traffic data must be retained for 90 days, unless a competent official instructs service providers to store data longer, i.e., up to one year on a special case-by-case basis or on a temporary basis. The bill would amend this section to allow a competent officer to order that it be kept for up to two years, where necessary. One would expect privacy advocates to have concerns about these amendments, but it should be noted that maximum period of data retention is but one of the variables in the overall data retention regime. Different countries have very different data retention regimes, so it is difficult to generalise about what is normal. On the whole, however, Thailand's data retention regime is in line with that of several other major jurisdictions, and this remains the case even if the maximum retention period is extended to two years, as is proposed. Most of the proposed amendments to the Computer Crimes Act would be improvements over the current Act. As always, however, success will depend on the regulations to be promulgated under the Act. Assuming the regulations are sensible, most of these amendments will operate to the benefit of service providers and internet users alike.

Two weeks ago the account of Wanmai, four-year-old sister of a well-known actor, was threatened with shutdown by the social media site. Thousands of her ""followers"" expressed their disagreement, even anger, with not just the announcement but also Instagram's minimum-age policy. Some Thai fans bombarded the account of Instagram's CEO Kevin Systrom with complaints, with the tone ranging from pleading to mildly threatening. Thai netizens love famous children, and parents love posting pictures of their children online, sometimes for fun, sometimes for a shot at fame. Before her account was locked, Wanmai's Instagram account had over 1.1 million followers. She's not the only kid to have such a huge fan base. Other Thai Instagram stars include Lyla, the four-year-old daughter of actress and model Paula Buttery, who has 148,000 followers. The account of Bena and Brooklyn Guy, two-year-old twins of celebrities Rybena and Prinya Intachai, has 436,000 followers. These accounts are maintained by their parents, though the account names are those of the children. Thai celebrities share pictures of their kids partly to maintain their profile. But non-celebrity parents also use social media to ""show"" their children — no more folded snapshots in a wallet, but uploaded albums for all to see. On Pantip, the most popular web forum in Thailand, many non-celebrity mothers post pictures of their children regularly. They give updates about their kids — first tooth, first solid meal, first day at school, and so on. The urge to share a child's personal story in the public sphere is strong, and some parents do not seem bothered by the fact that people who are looking at their children's pictures are complete strangers. On a slightly more controllable domain like Facebook, many parents have a strange habit of tagging many friends while posting pictures of their children, without bothering to even check those friends' privacy setting. This means the pictures posted are out there for the wider cyber public to see. Is it normal practice for parents to advertise their children to the world? For pride, for pleasure, or for profit? Is it — to ask the fundamental question — harmless for the children when their pictures are out there? Instagram requires everyone to be at least 13 years old before they can create an account, while Facebook clearly states that children under 13 are not allowed to sign up (the sites close down some accounts that violate the rules, but not all). Enforcement of these rules is even more complicated when the actual users of these child accounts are usually their parents. Thana*, who has a one-year-old daughter, launched a Facebook fanpage for his child when she was only a month old. The setting of the page is public, which means anyone on Facebook can view it. ""I just want to collect her pictures and videos. Posting them on this dedicated page allows my friends to see her grow. I don't mind the fact that her pictures are available publicly,"" said the 33-year-old father. He added that he probably would not mind if the pictures were used, as long as it was not for an improper purpose, which he felt was not very likely. Little boy playing on the beach Wipa*, 34, said she started a page for her baby daughter because she had seen how some children had entered showbiz starting from the very same beginnings. ""I was a follower of those pages before, and I saw how those kids ended up getting modelling jobs and being featured in magazines. I think my kid has potential — she looks good and loves having pictures taken. It doesn't hurt to try. There's nothing wrong with being adored by the public."" Porntip* also created a Facebook page for her one-year-old daughter. Her reason was to have a place to store her memories, in case her hard drive crashes. ""It's a safe place to store those precious moments. I think it's a parent's right to upload pictures of their children, as long as they know what they are doing. I don't think it could lead to anything dangerous,"" said the 32-year-old mother. Sirirath Chunnasart, child protection officer at Unicef Thailand, disagreed with the previous statement. While posting children's pictures online seems to be the norm for parents today, according to her it is not as harmless as many would think. ""Publicly available pictures can be dangerous. If you post too much information about your child, strangers can see what school he goes to, what time he finishes, what he likes to eat, when he's likely to be alone, and so on. Who knows what can happen from such information? Prevention is better than cure,"" she said. Currently, according to Sirirath, there is no clear rule about children's online presence, because it takes many years to develop a rule or a law, whereas social media can evolve within months. ""It is not clearly stated in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child whether children's pictures should be available online — the Convention is around 25 years old, while social media is relatively new. However, there have been numerous talks held at international level about children's online presence, especially regarding risks around child pornography. The UN and many NGOs are trying to find a clearer method to deal with this matter."" The habit of parents posting pictures of their children online is global. According to a 2014 article in UK broadsheet The Telegraph last year, a study suggested that just under a quarter of parents refrain from posting pictures of their children on social networking websites, with the majority saying that the main deterrent is that they feel like they have ""no control"" over who sees the photos. A recent US study found that 63% of mums use Facebook; of these, 97% said they post pictures of their child, 89% post status updates about them, and 46% post videos.  Sirirath said having your children's pictures on your personal social media account can be a positive thing if you do it with caution. ""Posting pictures of your child performing in a school play or doing something memorable could make him feel proud when he looks back,"" she said. ""But on the other hand, pictures that can make the child feel humiliated later should not be posted. Once something is online, you never know where it can end up."" She said parents must consider children's feelings, not just today when they are too young to understand, but also when they are an adult, looking back. Chances are these pictures will still be accessible online decades from now. ""Think of the long-term effect of the pictures that you post today,"" said the officer. ""Problems can come much later on, especially when your child is big enough to see those pictures. Present your child in a positive way, in just the right proportion, which can be good for his self-worth."""

He loved being noticed and showing off his talent. “When I grow up, I want to be a star, I want to be famous, I want to make a movie,” Patty recalled of the goal he set for himself all those years ago. ON SET: Pattaya’s Walking Street has long been a destination for sex tourists, but is increasingly attracting pornographic film-makers, mostly from Europe and Japan. But growing up, he didn’t feel comfortable in his own skin. He decided to come out to his parents and began his life as a katoey. Patty, who is from the south of Thailand where Islam is the main religion, didn’t care what the reaction would be from the community. Surprisingly everyone in his village, including his family, handled it well. Patty left the village and went to pursue her dreams at a performing arts school in another province. By the age of 18, Patty had grown up into a good-looking katoey. She felt comfortable being a she instead of a he. She became one of the glamorous dancers in a famous Phuket show and felt she was finally where she had always wanted to be. SHINING STAR Patty was living her dream, but at 15,000 baht a month, she felt the pay wasn't commensurate with the hard work. She wanted to use her appearance and skills to earn a living while not working quite so hard. Her friend introduced her to the world of prostitution. She wasn’t sure at first but decided to give it a go. “I was very young at that time and very curious to try something new. So I went with my friend to walk along the beach of Patong at night. After I got my first customer I felt like it was not so difficult to do,"" Patty said, adding that she had been a virgin until that point. ""So I left my job and started working as a full-time sex worker.” Tall and tanned, Patty is now 21 years old. She works at a ladyboy bar on Pattaya's infamous Walking Street. Patty identifies herself as a woman. She has breast implants but has kept her male sex organs. With a nice figure and attractive face, Patty became the star of her bar. But her admirers were confined to bar patrons and her customers. She started posting pictures of herself on a popular dating website and received hundreds of compliments from men around the world. One of her online fans was a Belgian film-maker who contacted her with an unexpected proposition. “Do you want to be a porn star?” the film director asked Patty in a message. It took her a week before getting back to him. “Yes, I want to be a porn star,” Patty replied. EXTRA INCOME: Transgender sex workers can earn thousands of baht per night on Pattaya’s Walking Street, but command higher rates for film work. TEMPTING OFFER Patty is not the only ladyboy in Pattaya attracting international pornographic film-makers. While the offers can be financially rewarding, the trade-off is often a loss of dignity and anonymity. Mae Mam, 42, is the mama-san at a ladyboy bar on Walking Street. It is 10pm and thumping music fills the empty neon-lit bar. Outside, skimpily-clad ladyboys are sitting coyly on stools applying make-up while waiting for customers to arrive. Mae Mam told Spectrum that many of the ladyboys she knows in Pattaya have done at least one porn movie. “Ladyboys, or shemales, are quite popular among Westerners and Middle Easterners,” Mae Mam said. “Many people come to Pattaya just to have sex with ladyboys. All of the customers who come here to pick up the ladyboys are married men seeking new sexual experiences.”           Many bars in Pattaya only employ pre-op transgender sex workers. Those who have had sexual reassignment surgery are not as popular. Mae Mam said the main reason most perform in films is the good pay. “On a regular night in the bar, one ladyboy earns 1,500–2,000 baht when they go with a customer, which can be for a short time or the whole night. But if they do a movie, they will get 10,000–20,000 baht basically to do the same thing but for only a few hours,” Mae Mam explained. Mae Mam has nothing to do with recruiting for the films, but is happy to offer advice and look out for those to get involved. “It is their own choice,” she says. ""I sometimes point out the pros and cons of being in a movie, to let them make their own decision. The only thing I tell them to do is to always practise safe sex. No matter how much the money is, we all have to love ourselves more than the money. I always tell all my girls to be smart."" LEADING LADIES: Patty is the star attraction at her bar, but wants to open a dance school. Sammy, inset, attracts less clients and turned to porn for extra income. CASH IN HAND Sammy, 29, has been working at a ladyboy bar in Pattaya for two years. She told Spectrum she was approached by a Russian film-maker twice before she agreed to be in a movie. Sammy is not the “star” of her bar. She cannot rely on getting customers every night. “I sometimes get three customers a week, which is not really enough for me,” she said. “When I heard from this Russian film-maker, I was quite hesitant because I didn’t want my family or friends to see it. But since I was struggling for money, I agreed to do it.” Sammy got 7,000 baht offer for her first “audition” in Bangkok. The film-maker also offered to pay for her transport. During the audition, all she had to do was perform on her own. “The first thing they did was give me a Viagra tablet to take,” she said. “Then I had to be sexy, slowly strip and flirt into the camera. The video ended after I finished masturbating. It was less than two hours and I went home with the same amount of money I usually earn in a week,” Sammy said. After the audition, the film-maker asked her to return to perform with a male actor. This time he offered Sammy 15,000 baht. She agreed without hesitation. “The minute I went in the room, I saw four men there,” she said. “They explained to me that there would only be one male actor in the movie. The rest of them were the camera and lighting team. So we shot the film. Filming lasted three hours and I went home with 15,000 baht cash in my pocket.” Because of Patty's star quality and bubbly personality she was able to demand higher fees. She was paid 20,000 baht for her first performance for the Belgian director. “The film-maker said the movie would be shot in Pattaya. On the day, they asked me to bring a sexy and naughty dress, put on make-up and do my hair. I did that and went to meet them at a private condominium. “There were four cameras in the room. The lights had already been set up. After I talked to the team about the concept of the movie, the production crew left the room. We made the whole film with just myself and the actor in the room with the cameras locked in position.” Patty has became more popular since filming the movie a few months ago. More customers come to the bar after seeing her on screen. Some want to have sex with her, while many simply want her to accompany them during their stay. LEGAL LOOPHOLE Pol Col Sukkatad Pumpanmuang, the new superintendent of Pattaya City Police Station, told Spectrum that no one has complained about adult movies being made in the area. Even if a report was made, it would be difficult to press charges. “We have no direct law to control this. The law protects children from getting involved with pornography and prostitution. Violators can face fines of 3,000 baht and serve three years in prison. But there is no law covering adults who give their consent to get involved with pornographic films,” Pol Col Sukkatad said. The police can only arrest someone if they catch them at the scene in the midst of a performance. If they want to arrest someone for selling pornography, the suspect must have sold the material inside Thailand. There are no laws to stop film-makers making pornographic movies in Thailand and selling them in other countries. “The best we can do is arrest the film-maker and fine everyone involved. Then we have to let them go without jail time,” Pol Col Sukkatad said. In 2004, 1,044 Thai people were surveyed on their views about pornography by Suan Dusit Poll. Asked which types of pornography cause the most problems in society, 23% cited material relating to incest, 22% gang rape, 20% hidden camera pornography, 19% child pornography, while 16% pointed to sex toy advertising.   Of all the respondents, 65% warned there is no way to solve the problem since the law fails to tackle the issue, and pornography is spread through numerous channels. A separate research project by a Chulalongkorn University student collected data on how pornography affects children aged nine to 11, students in Prathom 4-6 and junior high-school. It found 18% of boys and 14% of girls had been exposed to pornography by the time they reached Prathom 6. Some children — 0.3% of boys and 0.5% girls — had even viewed pornography in kindergarten.  Half of the children in the study said they accessed pornography through friends who passed movies to one another. Boys said they found it easy to find pornography on the internet, video tapes and DVDs, while girls reported seeing pornographic magazines and comics. EARLY RETIREMENT With two hit movies to her name, Patty felt her craving for the spotlight had been satisfied. She has since turned down offers from several Japanese and European film-makers because she doesn’t want to be recognised as a porn star. “I feel embarrassed when people ask me if I am that person from the film. I always say no. It is not something I am proud of,” Patty said. Patty makes it clear that she only did it for the money. She doesn’t want to make a living out of being a porn star. “I am working hard these days to save money and pursue my dreams. Besides sending cash home to take care of my family, I want to save up enough to open my own dancing school,” Patty said. “When I was younger, I thought I wanted to have sex-change surgery when I had enough money. Now that I can afford it, I think it is kind of unnecessary and irrational. My life doesn’t feel incomplete today. So I will save up all the money and go back to the South to open my own school.” Sammy has also had enough after making two movies and vows not to do it again, even if she gets a big offer. She is trying to save cash to open her own hair salon. “I was a hairdresser before coming to work in Pattaya. I loved doing that but I wanted more money. That's why I come here to be a sex worker,” Sammy said. She added that she is tired of being with one man after another and is thinking about moving back to her home town in western Thailand. Prince, a 33-year-old ladyboy and retired sex worker, said the industry is an unsuitable career choice in the long run. During her golden days 10 years ago, Prince made at least 20 pornographic movies with filmmakers from all over the world. She earned a lot, but felt it was time to bow out when she turned 30, since the industry is constantly being swamped with younger and more beautiful girls. Prince is now one of the most well-known faces in Pattaya. She has no dreams of opening her own business. Her only wish is to pass her experience of being a sex worker on to other ladyboys, to stop them facing the difficulties she did. “I educate people on how to protect themselves, because we never know who our customers will be. I am there if there is a problem with the police or anyone else. I thought I would quit completely after 30, but now I have a new purpose,” Prince explained. “I get nothing back in return but the satisfaction of helping someone who is in the same situation I was decade ago.” n"

Raisers have succeeded in adjusting their farming to curb the virus that ravaged Asia's booming shrimp industry over the past three years. The Thai Shrimp Association (TSA) yesterday forecast Thai shrimp production would recover to between 250,000 and 300,000 tonnes in 2015, with exports of 180,000 to 200,000 tonnes worth 75-80 billion baht. ""Prices are likely to remain stable next year, as global demand for shrimp is large,"" president Somsak Paneetatyasai said yesterday. But he said the shrimp industry was expected to end this year with production of only 230,000 tonnes due to EMS, with exports of only 150,000 to 160,000 tonnes worth about 60 billion baht. In the first 10 months of this year, Thailand exported 130,000 tonnes, down by 26% year-on-year, valued at 51 billion baht, down by 8%. EMS was first detected on a shrimp farm in China in 2009, then moved through Vietnam before spreading to Thailand in mid-2012. The outbreak has severely damaged the Thai shrimp industry and exports of related products. Before the disease, Thailand produced 500,000 to 600,000 tonnes of shrimp annually. Mr Somsak said Thailand would have to monitor the situation following termination of EU tax privileges under the Generalised System of Preferences this coming Jan 1. From that date, the EU tariff on Thai shrimp will triple to 12%, weakening Thailand's shrimp competitiveness, he said. To ease the impact, the TSA is urging the government to accelerate free trade talks with the EU and tackle the human trafficking issue. ""We've explained that the shrimp industry has nothing to do with forced or child labour, as  shrimp production is farm-based,"" Mr Somsak said. ""Nonetheless, the government should tackle these allegations as soon as possible."" The US State Department in June downgraded Thailand to its lowest status, Tier 3, in its 2014 Trafficking in Persons (TIP) report for not fully complying with minimum standards for the elimination of human trafficking. After being listed as Tier 2 for four years, Thailand joined Syria, Iran, North Korea and 17 other nations in Tier 3. The TIP report contains no mechanism for imposing trade barriers but states that any US opposition to assistance for foreign governments must exclude trade-related assistance. But the report could affect lending to the country, as the US could pressure international financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank not to lend to Thailand. The allegations centre on the shrimp, fish, sugar-cane, garment and pornography industries."

Japanese artist Megumi Igarashi paddles on a kayak in the shape of her own vagina at a launch ceremony in Tokyo on October 19, 2013	 Megumi Igarashi, who calls herself Rokude Nashiko -- offensive slang which loosely translates as ""reprobate child"" -- was arrested in July for trying to raise funds online to pay for the construction of a kayak, using a 3D printer, inspired by her genitals. She was released days later following a legal appeal and after thousands of people signed a petition demanding her freedom. But on Wednesday, Igarashi was re-arrested on suspicion of sending a link ""that shows her plan to create a boat using three-dimensional obscene data to a large number of people,"" a Tokyo police spokeswoman told AFP. She ""tried to have those people who were willing to finance her plan download the 3D obscene data"" in October last year, the spokeswoman said. Igarashi also allegedly sold CD-Roms containing similar data during a May exhibition in Tokyo. ""I don't believe my vagina is anything obscene,"" Igarashi said in a July press conference after her release, adding: ""I was determined I would never yield to police power."" Sex toy shop manager Minori Watanabe, 44, was also arrested for ""displaying obscene goods in her shop window in collusion with Igarashi"" from around October last year until July, police said. Japan has a notoriously vibrant pornography industry that caters to a vast array of tastes.  However, its obscenity laws still forbid the depiction of actual genitalia, which usually appear censored or pixellated in images and videos. If convicted of distributing, or holding obscene materials for the purpose of selling, Igarashi could receive up to two years in jail and/or a fine of as much as 2.5 million yen ($21,000)."

In this file photo, members of lower house listen to a speech at National Diet in Tokyo, on Jan 24, 2014. The bill, which cleared the house unanimously, will be sent to the upper house and likely enacted on Wednesday, in what could be one of the last duties of this parliament before an expected election next month. Under the bill, people who distribute revenge porn -- compromising pictures or videos of former partners -- face up to three years in prison or a fine of up to 500,000 yen ($4,300). The legislation was crafted following a high-profile stalking-murder case last year in Tokyo, in which a man harassed his former girlfriend by posting images of her online. The bill allows internet service providers to delete suspected revenge porn images without the uploader's consent, if the images are still there two days after a complaint is made. Police in the past have used laws against child prostitution and child pornography in cases where minors were victims of such images. Last year police charged 318 people over instances of ""revenge porn"" in which victims aged 18 or under were involved, up 34% from the previous year, the Asahi Shimbun reported, citing sources from the National Police Agency. A police agency official said the spread of smartphones played a part in the increased instances of the crime, the report said. Britain's government has proposed creating a new criminal offence of posting ""revenge porn"", punishable by a maximum jail term of two years."

The logo of mobile app ""Snapchat"", who recently announced ads will be woven into its service, is displayed on a tablet on January 2, 2014 in Paris	 The first Snapchat ads were to appear in the United States this weekend in a section of the service devoted to ""recent updates,"" the Los Angeles-based startup said in a blog post. ""We won't put advertisements in your personal communication -- things like Snaps or Chats. That would be totally rude,"" Snapchat said. ""We want to see if we can deliver an experience that's fun and informative, the way ads used to be, before they got creepy and targeted."" The new ads will be the first paid content at Snapchat. Users will have the option of ignoring ads, which will automatically disappear after being viewed or within 24 hours, according to Snapchat. The startup said the reason for dabbling with advertising is simply that it needs to make money. ""Advertising allows us to support our service while delivering neat content to Snapchatters,"" the blog post said.. The introduction of ads comes just weeks after a huge trove of evidently intercepted Snapchat images and videos were exposed online, raising fears about what may be revealed in messages intended to vanish seconds after beng viewed. In what was referred to as ""The Snappening,"" people who used a third-party program instead of the official Snapchat application had copies of supposedly transient missives squirrelled away by hackers who began posting them online. About half of Snapchat users are reported to be 17 years old or younger, raising worries that sexy self-shot images they thought would disappear will be shared on the Internet in what would amount to child pornography. Snapchat assured users that the startup's servers were not breached, nor were they the source of the leaked images. Outside applications eyed as sources for purloined Snapchat pictures are designed to let users undermine the intent of the service by keeping copies of self-destructing pictures sent or received. Snapchat rocketed to popularity, especially among teens, after the initial app was released in September 2011.

Contributing factors range from economic disparity, urbanisation and cheaper air travel to faster internet connections that have fostered a huge child pornography industry, with many types of offenders. A researcher from the children's rights group Terre des Hommes starts a session in a public chat room where users solicit a fake 10-year-old named ""Sweetie from the Philippines"", in a computer-generated image. The group says that in recent years more child prostitutes in Southeast Asia have been leaving the streets but the abusive sex trade has simply moved online. Sex offenders who prey on children have adjusted as technology and demographic changes in the region make it even easier to engage in illicit activities, says the 49-page report titled ""Protecting the Future: Improving the Response to Child Sex Offending in Southeast Asia"", released by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). Debunking the stereotype that those engaged in child sexual exploitation are westerners, the report also shows that Asian tourists and expats are increasingly involved. ""Tackling child sex exploitation is no simple task. Finding solutions to this appalling crime will require a concerted effort from a multitude of actors across the region,"" said Jeremy Douglas, the UNODC Regional Representative. ""The dividends from a well-coordinated response include efficiency and respect for the rule of law. But more importantly, it will create a safer environment for children and ensure offenders are stopped in their tracks."" Action in one country is longer sufficient as offenders can easily migrate to jurisdictions with less resistance, said Mr Douglas. ""For too long, a piecemeal approach has been the norm, and while national governments and the international community can count some major successes in the past few years, without a comprehensive response to the problem, exploitation will continue to lurk just below the surface,"" he warned. According to the International Labour Organisation, there are approximately 4.5 million victims of sexual exploitation around the world, around 20% of them children. These child victims exist in every country in Asia and are caught in a range of different circumstances that make them vulnerable to exploitation. The UNODC report explained the intertwined nature of sexual exploitation of children — which encompasses the overlapping issues of the prostitution, the depiction of children in sexual abuse material (child pornography), trafficking of children for sexual purposes, and the sexual abuse of children (including but not limited to child sex tourism). The report said socio-economic disparities increase vulnerability to victimisation, as GDP per capita in the region ranges from $944 in Cambodia, with similarly low levels in Myanmar and Laos, Vietnam ($1,716), Indonesia ($3,557), to Thailand and China (around $6,000). In Thailand, tourism constitutes 6.5% of the country's gross domestic product. The country is also a top destination for sex tourism for foreigners around the world. The combination of the region's youthful population and widespread poverty also increases vulnerability to child sex exploitation, the report said. The economic growth arising from tourism has not always translated into better opportunities for children who live in tourist areas, it said. Children found in these areas, such as those employed in entertainment establishments or living or working on the street, are at greater risk of being exploited. Unfortunately, historical, economic and social issues in the region have created in some cases an environment ripe for sex tourism and with this, avenues for the sexual exploitation of children in tourism and travel, the report emphasised. ""The scale of the challenge is immense. Cheaper air travel, globalisation and new telecommunications technologies all interact to exacerbate an already complex and difficult problem,"" the report concluded. As governments in the region struggle to take control of the situation, travellers who prey on the young adapt and move to areas with more lax regulation and enforcement. In short, a crackdown in one country can lead to an influx in another. For example, Cambodia, Vietnam and, more recently, Mongolia have suffered an influx of tourists whose main goal is to have sex with a child, possibly as a result of the Thai government's efforts to combat child sex exploitation within its borders. The information was provided by Ecpat, a non-government organisation to ""End Child Prostitution, Child Pornography and Trafficking of Children for Sexual Purposes."" Offenders have developed and shared a number of methods to disguise their criminal activities. For example, the use of multiple passports and absconding bail in order to travel between countries in the region, particularly to those that have a lower capacity for detecting these crimes, and concealing identities when engaged on online child sex chat forums, the report said. Well-established patterns of child sex exploitation integrated into tourism flows suggest future growth projections will threaten many more children in Myanmar and Cambodia as the number of arrivals is expected to triple and double, respectively. The process of urbanisation could also dislocate families from traditional and stable sources of income in their home countries, or regions. ""This economic precariousness can push some people into the sex industry, especially young people who are also disconnected from their families and susceptible to outside influence,"" the report added. Responses to this trend should not attempt to limit the flow of people into cities, but rather prepare them for the risks they may face, including internet education. As internet usage becomes more widespread across the region, more children will become vulnerable to online ""grooming"" and exploitation through sexual abuse materials and the online streaming of child sexual abuse, the report added. Protection in this area must encompass a wide range of actors beyond law enforcement, such as parents, schools and teachers, the UNODC noted. ""The online environment of the 21st century has transformed criminality in various ways: as an advanced vehicle for communications, it has created a transnational environment that provides new opportunities for organising and participating in harmful activities, and the virtual nature of the online environment means criminal activity can sometimes fall outside the jurisdiction of the criminal justice process,"" it said. The report also noted that those involved in ""child sex tourism"" were not only tourists but could also be business travellers, foreigners working directly with children and other vulnerable groups, military personnel posted abroad, diplomats and government employees, expatriates or foreign nationals on extended travel, and retired expats residing abroad."

The logo of Snapchat is seen at the front entrance of the company headquarters on November 14, 2013 in Venice, California	 In what was being referred to as ""The Snappening,"" people who used a third-party program instead of the official Snapchat application had copies of supposedly transient missives squirreled away by hackers who began posting them online late Thursday. About half of Snapchat users are reported to be 17 years old or younger, raising worries that sexy self-shot images they thought would disappear will be shared on the Internet in what would amount to child pornography. Snapchat released a statement Friday saying the startup's servers were not breached, nor were they the source of the leaked images. The San Francisco-based company maintained that ""Snapchatters were victimized"" due to the use of outside applications to send or receive ""Snaps"" in a practice prohibited under the startup's terms of service. Outside applications being eyed as sources for purloined Snapchat pictures are designed to let users undermine the intent of the service by keeping copies of self-destructing pictures sent or received. - Malicious apps - Unsanctioned mobile applications that basically hack into Snapchat have apparently been gathering copies of messages for years, storing them at a computer or computers online. Hackers boasted a 13 gigabyte library of imagery, according to a report at news website Business Insider. ""Anybody who saw all those third-party Snapchat hack apps in the App Store should have seen it coming,"" said Nico Sell, founder of encrypted mobile messaging service Wickr and an organizer of the DefCon gathering of hackers annually in Las Vegas. ""You could tell that those were semi-malicious apps."" That is among reasons Wickr blocks third-party apps from working with the service, and why its messages ""see no other computer"" than the one they are sent to, according to Sell. ""Technically, it could have been solved,"" Sell said of The Snappening. ""It could also be solved by the ecosystem not letting those apps exist."" Users of anonymity focused online forum 4chan have been downloading the swiped Snapchat messages and are constructing a searchable online archive, Business Insider reported. The boasted 13 gigabytes of files could equal about a billion low-resolution images, by some estimates. Snapchat rocketed to popularity, especially among teens, after the initial app was released in September 2011. Created by then Stanford University students, the app allows the sending of messages that disappear shortly after being viewed."

											Pope backs reform as Church begins review on family, marriage										",https://search.bangkokpost.com/track/visitAndRedirect?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bangkokpost.com%2Fworld%2F436039%2Fpope-backs-reform-as-church-begins-review-on-family-marriage&contentId=news436039,"VATICAN CITY - Pope Francis on Sunday issued a strong signal of support for reform of the Catholic Church's approach to marriage, cohabitation and divorce as bishops began a landmark review of teaching on the family. Pope Francis leads a vigil prayer in preparation for the Synod on the Family on October 4, 2014 at St Peter's square at the Vatican	 Opening an extraordinary synod of nearly 200 senior clerics, Francis suggested the Church must address the present gulf between what it currently says on these issues and what tens of millions of believers actually do. Thorny theological questions such as whether divorced and remarried believers should be able to receive communion will dominate two weeks of closed-door discussions set to pit conservative clerics against reformists led by German cardinal Walter Kasper. Vatican insiders say Kasper has the backing of Francis but that the pontiff wants consensus for any change. That stance was reflected in the sermon the pontiff delivered at the synod's opening mass. In it, he urged bishops to be generous in understanding the problems faced by ordinary believers trying to live within the rules of the church. Pointedly, he invoked a passage from the gospel of Matthew which admonishes ""evil pastors (who) lay intolerable burdens on the shoulders of others which they themselves do not lift a finger to move"". He added: ""Synod Assemblies are not meant to discuss beautiful and clever ideas, or to see who is more intelligent. ""They are meant to better nurture and tend the Lord’s vineyard.... In this case the Lord is asking us to care for the family."" Since becoming pontiff just over 18 months ago, Francis has repeatedly urged the church to tend to the ""wounds"" caused by family breakdown rather than seeking to exclude or judge the many divorced people, cohabiting couples and single mothers within its ranks. He has underlined that stance by personally marrying couples who had lived together ""in sin"" prior to their weddings and by baptising a child born to parents married outside of the church. - Deep divisions -  Francis's reforming instincts have already been demonstrated in the steps he has taken to overhaul the way the Vatican bank and administration are run and the strong signals he has issued about the determination of the Church to deal with the issue of clerical sex abuse. But updating the Church's approach to social issues is seen as a tougher challenge. Conservatives in the Vatican hierarchy have vowed to fight any dilution of traditional doctrine. The Church's view of marriage has come to be seen as outdated by many in a world where, in some developed countries, nearly one in two marriages ends in divorce and where the notion of the institution itself has been challenged by the global trend towards the legalisation of same-sex weddings. The bishops gathered in Rome are certainly not about to embrace gay marriage, and few Vatican observers expect much, if any, change on questions such as contraception, another area where Catholic teaching contrasts with the daily practice of millions. - Easier divorce? - But with Francis on the side of reform, the feeling is that the synod process could lead to change when it finally reaches conclusions expected in 2016. The most notable of these could be a change in the rules to make it possible for Catholics who divorce and then remarry to receive communion. That has been banned for centuries. But critics say the Church's stance is hard to defend given that individuals who have declared their repentance from more serious breaches of the Christian code, such as murder, can take communion. While the Church may not yet be ready to take a step that would amount to a de facto acceptance of divorce in certain circumstances, the discussions could result in steps to make it easier for failed marriages to be annulled. Another area in which the Church could send out a signal of compassion is by making it clear that priests should be ready to baptise the children of same sex couples, regardless of the doctrinal disapproval of their parents' union. Other issues due to be addressed include the role of easily-available pornography in family breakdown and the Church's attitude to individuals in polygamous unions."

British computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee, the man credited with inventing the World Wide Web, gives a speech on April 18, 2012 in Lyon, central France. Tim Berners-Lee, a computer scientist who invented the web 25 years ago, called for a bill of rights that would guarantee the independence of the internet and ensure users' privacy. ""If a company can control your access to the Internet, if they can control which websites they go to, then they have tremendous control over your life,"" Mr Berners-Lee said at the London ""Web We Want"" festival on the future of the internet. ""If a Government can block you going to, for example, the opposition's political pages, then they can give you a blinkered view of reality to keep themselves in power."" ""Suddenly the power to abuse the open Internet has become so tempting both for government and big companies."" Mr Berners-Lee, 59, is director of the World Wide Web Consortium, a body which develops guidelines for the development of the Inernet. He called for an Internet version of the ""Magna Carta"", the 13th century English charter credited with guaranteeing basic rights and freedoms. Concerns over privacy and freedom on the Internet have increased in the wake of the revelation of mass government monitoring of online activity following leaks by former US intelligence contractor Edward Snowden. A ruling by the European Union to allow individuals to ask search engines such as Google to remove links to information about them, called the ""right to be forgotten"", has also raised concerns over the potential for censorship. ""There have been lots of times that it has been abused, so now the Magna Carta is about saying...I want a web where I'm not spied on, where there's no censorship,"" Mr Berners-Lee said. The scientist added that in order to be a ""neutral medium"", the Internet had to reflect all of humanity, including ""some ghastly stuff"". ""Now some things are of course just illegal, child pornography, fraud, telling someone how to rob a bank, that's illegal before the web and it's illegal after the web,"" Mr Berners-Lee added."

It’s rather puzzling, however, because we are not quite sure whether the two actors, Wachara Kanha and Vidura Amranand, are humans who act like animals or animals with the ability to speak. It’s unsatisfying, unfortunately, because we never get to see them have sex, instead just a series of intense physical and verbal foreplay. More than anything, it’s absurd, both in terms of dialogue and plot (not predictable, like in Japanese adult videos). They seduce each other, then they start hitting each other. They talk in all seriousness about what Schomburgk’s deer are, the species, its history, its physique. Then they talk about a dead butterfly, a murdered puppy and a few other irrelevant issues. The story starts with a tour guide, played by director Saifah Tanthana, coming out to take the audience into the theatre, or “a zoo”. Inside, where Wachara and Vidura are waiting, a song about various types of animals begins to play and the pair dance along, their movements imitating the different creatures. The audience is then invited to take photos with the animals. From the start until this point, the actors’ faces have been utterly expressionless, as if sick and exhausted by the countless groups of tourists who flock to see them put on the same show over and over again. Then the scene shifts to what seems like their bedroom. On one chair, there’s a book about Schomburgk’s deer. On the other is a sleep mask. The first transformation we see occurs in Vidura’s eyes — they have suddenly been unfrozen and become sensual and playful, how she really is in the privacy of her own room. As Wachara begins to read aloud information about Schomburgk’s deer — how long their horns are, their habits, their gradual population decline to extinction; how the last Schomburgk’s deer on Earth was killed by a drunkard in 1938 — Vidura glides sensually about the room, at times bending over, her rear-end up, eyeing Wachara invitingly. As this seduction between the couple proceeds, each begins to recite a monologue, which have no connection whatsoever to one another. Wachara talks about a butterfly he saw as a child — how it was flying over a dead butterfly; how it could be its friend, sister or lover; how this incident taught him to care for other people; how he wants to be born a butterfly in his next life. Vidura, on the other hand, talks about how Schomburgk’s deer still exist in the blood of other types of deer. She contemplates the significance of being “the first” or “the last” of a kind, and how first and last loves aren’t the only meaningful relationships — those in between also count for something. The play then moves gradually away from seduction and toward tension and violence. A sleeping mask has somehow become a game for the couple. They try to snatch it from one another, and to escape from the other’s embrace. They crawl over each other and, finally, hit one another. But there is no pain, they groan more in pleasure than agony. It is like watching wild animals on Animal Planet — you can’t decide if they are hunting one another down or on their way to a heavenly copulatory session. In the final part of the performance, their traits have become more human. But the persistent sexual tension and competitiveness between the couple remains. They shout at each other, letting out a tirade of every swear word imaginable. They try to put each other down by different means, one of these being Vidura saying that Wachara is bad in bed. It will probably never be clear as to the what the director means by The Last Schomburgk’s Deer, but the acting, the emotions and the words (though they don’t quite make sense) certainly feel real. If this performance is a fight for sexual dominance, Vidura is definitely the winner. While Wachara has the benefit of his tattoos, which add to his rawness, it’s Vidura’s fierce and sensual movements that take control and set the tone of the performance. The Last Schomburgk’s Deer is porn in the sense that human emotions, feelings and desires — not their bodies — are laid bare. A foreigner could have understood and felt the performance almost just as well as a Thai, as it was not as much about what as how they spoke. Everything — the dialogue, the monologues, the game, the cursing, the fight, the violence — was driven by sexual desire. We feel more comfortable with this raw desire and violence when it’s portrayed through animals, despite the fact that it’s actually a faithful reflection of what’s inside everyone. Taking us into a zoo is a trick, creating an illusion that we’re looking at someone — or something — else. - The Last Schomburgk’s Deer runs at Crescent Moon Space, Pridi Banomyong Institute from Sept 12-15 at 7.30pm.

""We're not really confident of an upgrade, as several countries such as Brazil have taken more than three years to address the issue,"" said Panjit Pisawong, deputy director-general of the Foreign Trade Department. ""However, we're preparing to submit documents to the US State Department next March showing Thailand's progress in hopes we will rise from the lowest level."" The State Department downgraded Thailand to the lowest Tier 3 status in its 2014 Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report for not fully complying with minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking. Thailand joined Syria, Iran and North Korea and 17 other nations on Tier 3. Thailand did sit at Tier 2 for four years prior. The TIP report does not contain any mechanism to impose trade barriers, and states any US opposition to assistance for foreign governments must exclude trade-related assistance. But the report could affect lending to the country. The US could decide to put pressure international financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank not to lend to Thailand. The allegations mainly centre on the shrimp, fish, sugar cane, garment and pornography industries. Ms Panjit said the National Council for Peace and Order prioritised cracking down on human trafficking and other problems related to the exploitation of illegal labour. One of the junta's measures was to set up a one-stop service centre to register migrant workers. The centre is supposed to speed up the documentation of workers, mainly from neighbouring countries, as part of security measures to ensure their access to labour rights and benefits. The private sector, especially small operators, agreed to a code of conduct regarding labour standards."

The Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) said the Thai mother of the children, Siriwan Nitichad, had agreed to carry a child for the man and his wife who had not been able to conceive. ""She said her husband wanted to have a baby so much, please help them, please help them,"" the woman, who is also known as Aon, told the broadcaster. Aon, who lives in Phetchabun province, said she agreed to use her own eggs, was paid about A$5,500 (163,927 baht) and gave birth to twins some years ago. The report did not specify the children's ages. The Australian couple took the children home, but court documents show that the father, who cannot be named, was last year charged with abusing them, the ABC said. The man, who denies the allegations which include the possession of child pornography, is expected to fight the charges when they go to court later this year. The children have remained with the man's ex-wife, but Aon said she was open to the idea of taking the twins back. ""If they don't have anyone to take care of them, we are happy to take care of them,"" she said. The case follows that of Gammy who was born with Down's syndrome to a Thai surrogate for an Australian couple in December. The couple took the boy's healthy twin sister back to Australia but left Gammy in Thailand. The couple denied deliberately abandoning their baby son and have said they will try to get him back. Meanwhile, Suchada Mongkolchaipak, a gynaecologist at Phyathai Sriracha Hospital in Chon Buri, on Monday filed a police complaint over being wrongly cited online as a commercial surrogacy practitioner. Dr Suchada said an acquaintance informed her that her name and contact information appeared on the foreign website www.familiesthrusurrogacy.com. She said the posting hurt her reputation, saying she has worked at the Phyathai Sriracha Hospital in Chon Buri for over a decade and practices surrogacy following the Medical Council of Thailand's regulations, which prohibit its commercial form."

""Now showing five films back-to-back all day long,"" reads the sign on the front of the building. Open the doors of discreet cinemas like this one in the Yaowaraj area and a decidedly non-discreet lifestyle opens. But few of the people who visit this run-down cinema in Klong Toey are interested in film; they are here for something else. ""People who go inside that movie theatre are not normal,"" Pa Porn, who runs a noodle stall less than 100m from the main entrance, told Spectrum. ""It's a good thing that I am not living in this area, otherwise I'd be really concerned about my children's welfare. What state of mind do you think those people might be in after spending hours watching that kind of movie?"" The cinema is one of the so-called ""second-class movie theatres"" which still operate in Bangkok, a relic of the city's cinematic boom in the 1960s which provided many Thais with their first taste of Western culture. Nowadays, the standalone cinema buildings are mostly derelict, as customers flock towards shiny new megaplex centres inside Bangkok's myriad shopping malls. But for a small group of people, the cinemas still provide an essential service. RAISING THE CURTAIN Spectrum is aware of at least three second-class cinemas that remain open in Bangkok. One is located right alongside the BTS tracks, its main entrance opening onto the main road where people wait for buses or jostle for walking space. The cinema building is nearing a state of disrepair, but echoes a sense of a past elegance now long forgotten. The main foyer of the cinema is decorated with old film posters. To the left, a woman sits behind a ticket booth with the number ""60"" emblazoned on it, signifying the price of a ticket. ""How many?"" the woman asked, casting an unfriendly stare through the frosted glass with a round hole cut in the middle. Once the single ticket was purchased, the woman stuck the stub out through the hole in the glass and pointed towards the main entrance of the cinema, where a middle-aged man wearing a white shirt tucked into black trousers stood in front of a closed red curtain. The ticket was torn in half, the ticket collector keeping one part and giving back the other. Then he opened the red curtain to reveal the space which Pa Porn, the noodle vendor, had described as a gathering place for ""abnormal"" people. SECRET LIVES When first walking in, the cinema looks very much like an ordinary movie theatre, with hundreds of cheap red leather spring chairs placed in gently tiered rows. But this is no ordinary cinema, and there will be no Hollywood blockbusters shown on its screen. The films are all R-rated; soft-core pornography showing men and women in realistic love scenes. Another key difference is the audience. Despite the hundreds of vacant seats, the few dozen patrons - all men - choose not to sit, instead congregating at the cinema entrance, behind the back row and outside the toilets. ""Are you looking for company?"" an older Chinese-looking man in his fifties asked as he approached Spectrum. ""You seem new here. If you are looking for some company, this is the place to be. If you want some action, you have to go up all the way to the back of the theatre. You will find what you are looking for."" Spectrum followed the man's instruction to see what kind of ""action"" was going on at the back of cinema, and spotted at least 30 men walking around the big open area behind the back row. Some were pairing up, some gathered as a big group at a corner. Others stood alone. ""Have you found what you were looking for?"" the same man asked. He explained that most of the people who come to this type of cinema are not coming for the film itself. ""They are here purely for the action."" One of the men, who identified himself only as Pon, lives outside Bangkok but frequently makes the trip into the city to attend the cinema. ""I am a married man. I have a wife and kids. I have been married for so long and my sexual tastes have changed,"" the 52-year-old said. ""Now I like younger men, and that is what I am here for."" Mr Pon sneaks away from his family and business once a week to attend the second-class movie theatre. In an attempt to avoid bumping into anyone he knows, he moves around to the many different cinemas that operate in Bangkok. ""This is a secret part of my life. I like having occasional fun with some young men, but I still want to keep my family life."" THE LADIES IN RED Spectrum ventured to a second cinema, located closer to Bangkok's business district, after reading online that it offered more hard-core adult films. The look and feel of the cinema was much the same as the first one, albeit on a slightly smaller scale. ""No photography allowed inside,"" a woman yelled out from behind the ticket booth as we entered, without revealing her face. Spectrum handed the ticket to the collector, who tore it in half, gave a friendly smile, and warned: ""Watch your wallet and phone."" Inside the cinema, there are fewer men hanging around, but there is a group of transgender women, all wearing red dresses. Some also wear blood-red lipstick, a red purse or red high heels. This cinema is smaller than the other one and has only two entrances concealed behind a red curtain. Once the curtain is opened, a 5m by 10m screen is revealed showing a hard-core Japanese pornographic film. While R-rated films depicting nudity and sex are technically legal for viewers aged over 20, these hard-core porn movies are not — nor is the activity which goes on inside the cinema. After walking around the whole theatre, Spectrum took a seat in one of the many vacant chairs. A short time later, one of the transgender women walked over and struck up a conversation. ""Are you lonely?"" she asked in a deep masculine voice. The transgender woman identified herself as Nong, 43. She has been a sex worker at the cinema for the past eight years. ""I started coming here as a customer at first,"" Nong said. ""Then I began to cruise around and make some money from having quick fun with lonely men who came here. I then told my friends, and now here we are working together in this cinema."" Nong, who acts as a mama-san at the theatre, told Spectrum she earns at least 1,000 baht on a regular day, and sometimes up to 3,000 baht on weekends and public holidays. ""I know every girl [ladyboy] who works here. If anyone wants to come here to do this job, they will have to go through me first,"" she said. Nong explained that almost all of her customers are married men, many of them heterosexual, who are looking for some ""stimulation"" while watching the pornographic films. ""It's dark in here, so no one can really see us,"" she said. ""We wouldn't stand a chance outside if they saw clearly what we look like. I have to admit that none of us are good looking, but we can do a real fine job."" LACKING PROTECTION PHOTOS: BANGKOK POST LIBRARY Nong admits to performing some sexual services without a condom. ""I am concerned about my health, we all are,"" she said. ""We try to practise safe sex most of the time, but my stomach needs to be fed, I have bills to pay, I don't think I have that much negotiating power."" Surang Janyam, the director of Service Workers in Group Foundation (Swing) Thailand, explained that transgender sex workers in movie theatres are among the most vulnerable groups since they have limited options in term of work and have less access to safe sex than other sex workers. ""They have to face health and safety risks on a daily basis,"" Ms Surang said. ""They might get robbed, or be forced to have unprotected sex. Since they are not young or attractive, their choices are limited."" But Ms Surang said that the answer does not lie with the police. She said to raid the cinemas and remove the sex workers would not be a permanent way to solve the problem, as they would always come back for quick and easy money if society has nothing better to offer them. ""We are not trying encourage them to continue working as sex workers, but we are trying to educate them to be safe in their job,"" she said. ""Eventually, if they are ready to do something else, we are here to walk them through the next step of their lives."" PLEASING THE MASSES Ever since megaplexes grew in popularity — despite their high prices for tickets, popcorn and beverages — the number of people attending second-class cinemas has dwindled rapidly. To survive, cinema owners had make to themselves more competitive. ""First they cut their prices, and then they offered more movies for the same price,"" Prasit, a former ticket collector at a second-class cinema which is now closed, explained. Mr Prasit, who is now in his fifties, said owners began offering two movies back-to-back for the cost of a single ticket, and even began showing films back-to-back all day long with a half-hour break between which customers could also view with a single ticket. ""The customers could come in at any time and can spend all day if they wanted to,"" he said. ""But even that still couldn't pull back customers from the shopping mall cinemas."" A bit over a decade ago, the cinemas played their trump card. ""They decided to show erotic films to gain back some customers, which worked out quite well for a while,"" Mr Prasit said. ""They then moved from erotic movies to hard-core porn films. That's when I started to see hundreds of people back in the cinema again."" Still, the cinemas are slowly on their way out, and police say they are better left to die a natural death. 'UNDER CONTROL' Pol Col Chitpop Tomuam is superintendent of the Anti-Human Trafficking Division 1 in Bangkok, and is in charge of prostitution and human-trafficking cases. He told Spectrum that police are keeping prostitution ""under control"" by assigning local officers in each area to ""keep their eyes"" on the issue. ""It has been a while since we last raided a second-class cinema, but we always keep these places under control,"" Pol Col Chitpop said. (Story continues below) IN PLAIN SIGHT: The entrance to one second-class cinema opens onto a busy Bangkok street. He explained that his office is focusing more on human trafficking issues involving migrant workers, child traffickers and forced labour. However, he said prostitution is an issue that police are always concerned about. Spectrum also contacted Pol Lt Col Amnart Harn-Chana, deputy superintendent of Bang Sue police station and chief of the area's crime suppression unit. One of the city's second-class movie theatres is located in his jurisdiction. He admitted to Spectrum that the cinemas are of little concern to police as there are bigger and more serious issues for officers to deal with. ""To be honest with you, we are focusing on female prostitution more than transgender. There are a lot more of them in front of Chatuchak park,"" Pol Lt Col Amnart said. He explained that since the last police raid on the Bang Sue cinema in 2005, the movie theatre has stopped showing hard-core pornographic films. Therefore, he said, police have stopped sending investigators there. ""We are taking serious action against underage and forced prostitution, which really only applies to females. Transgender sex workers are doing this voluntarily, so we don't really do anything about it,"" he explained. ""In order to charge them with prostitution, we would have to arrest them while they are trading money for sexual services. Otherwise the best we can do is to charge them for 'strolling around for prostitution', which carries a very small penalty of no more than a 500-baht fine,"" he added. Thung Mahamek deputy superintendent Pol Lt Col Chaiyapon Ake-kul, who also head his area's crime suppression unit, said he was also keeping an eye on the problem but did not pay that much attention to what was going on inside the cinemas. ""The owner of the cinema [in my jurisdiction] is going to sell the land soon. Last time I heard, they are about to close the cinema. So we are no longer controlling it since it is going to be over soon anyway,"" Pol Lt Col Chaiyapon said. He also told Spectrum that it would be easy to raid the cinema, but the consequences would not necessarily be positive. ""I could even raid it on daily basis, but there would be many people who would suffer because of it,"" he said. ""What are those transgender sex workers going to do if we shut the cinemas? I feel bad for them as human beings. I think relevant government units should provide some sort of career or solution for these people so they can earn a living by doing something else instead of having to work as prostitutes. ""We can raid the cinema, shut it down and throw the sex workers out on the street. But what's next for them? If there is nothing better for them to do, they will eventually get back to this type of business again,"" he added. BREAKING THE TABOO Naiyana Supapung is the coordinator of the Teeranat Kanjanaauksorn Foundation, which works to promote gender and sexual justice. She explained that these second-class cinemas were serving as a hub for sexual activity mainly among bisexual and gay men and transgenders. She said humans in general will always look at people with diverse sexual preferences as an unusual phenomenon. At some point in the past, heterosexual men who had lower incomes were the regular customers of the second-class cinemas. Ms Naiyana explained that over time, this type of cinema had simply transformed into a space for men to express their sexual needs away from the public eye. ""What is unusual about this is not why there are males coming to this type of cinema, but why there are no single females going to watch erotic films as well,"" she said. ""Our society believes that to express sexuality among men is acceptable, while it is taboo for women to do so. ""Men have no limit in terms of expressing their sexual needs. They can go to see porn films, have multiple wives or even pay for sex, but it is completely opposite when women are doing it,"" she added. Ms Naiyana said the reason why these porn cinemas have become the gathering place for bisexual and gay men is not normal in the eyes of most heterosexual people. ""The perception is different because of their own prejudices: that a space where people can express their sexual needs is reserved for men only,"" she said. ""It is not unusual that these people use movie theatres as the place to cruise for sex, but it is unusual that some people see this as a problem. ""When there are spaces for them to express their sexual needs, they just go and do it since it is natural thing to do.""

Google defended its policy of electronically monitoring its users' content for child sexual abuse after it tipped off police in Texas to a child pornography suspect	 Houston restaurant worker John Henry Skillern, 41, was arrested Thursday following a cyber-tip that Google had passed along via the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), based outside Washington. ""He was trying to get around getting caught, he was trying to keep it inside his email,"" said detective David Nettles of the Houston Metro Internet Crimes Against Children Taskforce. ""I can't see that information, I can't see that photo -- but Google can,"" he told Houston television station KHOU, which first reported the story. It's common knowledge that the world's leading Internet service, like its rivals, tracks users' online behavior in order to fine-tune its advertising services. But the Texas case prompted concerns about the degree to which Google might be giving information about its users' conduct to law enforcement agencies. ""The story seems like a simple one with a happy outcome -- a bad man did a crime and got caught,"" blogged John Hawes, chief of operations at Virus Bulletin, a cyber security consultancy. ""However, there will of course be some who see it as yet another sign of how the twin Big Brothers of state agencies and corporate behemoths have nothing better to do than delve into the private lives of all and sundry, looking for dirt,"" he said. In an email to AFP, a Google spokesperson said Monday: ""Sadly, all Internet companies have to deal with child sexual abuse. ""It’s why Google actively removes illegal imagery from our services -- including search and Gmail -- and immediately reports abuse to the NCMEC."" The NCMEC operates the CyberTipline, through which Internet service providers can relay information about suspect online child sexual abuse on to police departments. ""Each child sexual abuse image is given a unique digital fingerprint which enables our systems to identify those pictures, including in Gmail,"" added the spokesperson, who did not disclose technical details about the process. ""It is important to remember that we only use this technology to identify child sexual abuse imagery -- not other email content that could be associated with criminal activity (for example using email to plot a burglary).” In a separate email to AFP, the NCMEC said federal law requires Internet service providers to report suspected child porn to the CyberTipline. ""NCMEC makes all CyberTipline reports available to appropriate law-enforcement agencies for review and possible investigation,"" it said. On its website Monday, KHOU described Skillern as a registered sex offender, convicted 20 years ago of sexually assaulting an eight-year-old boy. Investigators who raided his home  allegedly found child porn on his phone and tablet device, as well as cellphone videos of children visiting the Denny's family restaurant where he worked as a cook. Skillern has been charged with one count of possession of child pornography and one count of promotion of child pornography. He remains in custody on a $200,000 bond, KHOU said. Google's online set of ""program policies"" for its Gmail service, with more than 400 million users worldwide, includes ""a zero-tolerance policy against child sexual abuse imagery."" ""If we become aware of such content, we will report it to the appropriate authorities and may take disciplinary action, including termination, against the Google accounts of those involved,"" it states. Last year, Google's chief legal officer David Drummond, writing in Britain's Daily Telegraph newspaper, acknowledged Google had created technology to ""trawl"" for known images of child sex abuse."" ""We can then quickly remove them and report their existence to the authorities,"" he said.  "

""The Internet has played a major role in undermining public morality,"" 89-year-old Mahathir said in a blog posting Friday, adding that ""today any child can access pornography of the worse kind. ""I don’t care how sacred is freedom but I think the time has come for governments, at least the Malaysian government to censor the Internet."" Mahathir pledged in the 1990s that the government would never censor the Internet, in a bid to lure high-tech foreign investment. ""Not knowing the power of the Internet, I promised that we (speaking then as the prime minister of Malaysia) would not censor it. But today I have changed my mind,"" he said. Mahathir, an avid social media user, said Internet content was already censored. ""I myself have suffered from such censorship. When I put on my blog, an article on the Jews, without any explanation, my article was prevented from being linked to Facebook,"" he said. Tony Pua, 42-year-old opposition lawmaker with the Democratic Action Party, told AFP that he supported ""some degree of Internet control"" against pornography but there should be no censorship of news or opinion pieces. ""Our concern is in Malaysia's case, such restriction of the Internet will be used by the ruling government to increase their stranglehold on power and to suppress the opposition's voice for the purpose of retaining power,"" he told AFP. Malaysia's opposition is vocal on issues related to corruption, human rights abuses and crime. About 66 percent of the 30-million-strong population are estimated to use the Internet.  "

Parents and child protection campaigners angrily protest over the recent alleged rape of a 6-year-old schoolgirl, in Bangalore on July 19, 2014	 The 30-year-old instructor at a top private school in Bangalore was arrested Sunday over the alleged assault on the premises earlier this month, the city's police commissioner said. Police also seized a laptop containing child pornography from the instructor, who had worked at the school since 2011, commissioner Raghavendra Auradkar told reporters. ""The videos were downloaded from porn sites through the Internet,"" Auradkar said late on Sunday.  ""He is married and has a three-year-old child too. We will produce him in the local court on Monday and seek his custody for further interrogation and investigation,"" Auradkar said. Angry parents have held a series of protests in Bangalore over the incident, as India struggles to rebuild its battered reputation over levels of sexual violence in the country.  Police said the girl had complained of the July 2 attack to a teacher at Vibgyor High School. But her parents only learned of the incident a week later when she shared details with them. The child was allegedly assaulted in a classroom at the school, a top fee-paying institution favoured by local politicians and businessmen. The instructor supervised roller-skating activities for the students as part of the school's sports programme.  India is especially sensitive to cases of sexual violence after the 2012 fatal gang-rape of a student on a moving bus in New Delhi, which led to a public outcry and new tougher laws to deter rapists."

Picture taken by Rokude Nashiko and Marie Akatani on October 19, 2013 shows artist Megumi Igarashi paddling a kayak designed to be the shape of her own vagina in Tokyo	 Megumi Igarashi, 42, who calls herself Rokude Nashiko which roughly translates as ""bastard kid"", had been trying to raise funds online to pay for the construction of a kayak, using a 3D printer, modelled on the shape of her genitals. Japan has a notoriously vibrant pornography industry that caters to a vast array of tastes. But obscenity laws still forbid the depiction of actual genitalia, which usually appear censored or pixellated in images and videos. The artist -- who has created other genital-inspired artworks -- was arrested Saturday for ""distributing data that could create an obscene shape through a 3D printer,"" a police spokesman told AFP on Tuesday. Before her arrest, Igarashi -- who remained in detention on Tuesday -- had collected about one million yen ($9,800) through an Internet crowd funding site.  In exchange for donations, she supplied data to supporters that would let them create 3D prints of her genitals. Igarashi's supporters said they were shocked by what they described as the police's unusually broad use of Japan's obscenity laws in this case. Activist Minori Kitahara said police raided Igarashi's office and seized 20 of her artworks. ""Japan is still a society where those who try to express women's sexuality are suppressed, while men's sexuality is overly tolerated,"" she said. Japan's pornography industry is predominantly targeted at men and the country only last month made the possession of child pornography illegal. The ban excludes ""manga"" comics -- those aimed at adults as well as children, ""anime"" video and computer-generated graphics, following calls to protect freedom of expression. Campaigners had long urged Japan to toughen its stance on child pornography, complaining it was a major source of the material for global markets. If convicted, Igarashi could receive up to two years in jail or a fine of as much as 2.5 million yen, according to her lawyer."

About 15 years ago my son, who was in his early teens, was travelling on the night train from Chiang Mai to Bangkok with a group from his school. A couple of hours after the kids and their chaperones had settled in their bunks for the night, my son felt the groping hands of a State Railway of Thailand (SRT) employee. He shooed him away and spent the rest of the night wide awake in order to protect himself should the offender return. I was furious to hear this story of abuse and immediately went to the SRT office in Chiang Mai. I waited patiently to be sure that the incident was reported to the right person — to someone who would be concerned and take action. It was a waste of time and effort. No one seemed concerned. No one cared. No apology was made and it was clear that nothing would be done. It didn’t seem to be a big deal. Their response made me wonder if this was just one of hundreds of similar cases. It makes me furious to hear the SRT respond as if such a thing has never happened before. How sad that a child had to die before it became a big deal. A sad mother In “Prapat is a scapegoat” (PostBag July 11), Martin R says I jumped on the bandwagon to suggest State Railway of Thailand (SRT) ex-governor Prapat Chongsanguan resign before I knew the facts. Mr Prapat had ample opportunity to review the situation and find out the background of the 22-year old steward prior to making his statements to the press that the man was not a direct employee of the SRT. If Mr Prapat is, (was), indeed governor of the SRT, it is like being a corporate president. His subordinates present him with the facts before he makes a statement or decision. Thailand is not Japan where personal and political honour are important and preserved. Here honour is disregarded for power and salary. Jack Gilead Martin R writes that (ex-SRT chief) Prapat Chongsanguan was a scapegoat. I beg to differ. Mr Prapat, like the president of the United States or any other country, the PM of Thailand or any other country, a corporate president, governor, leader, is ultimately responsible for any action or consequence, good or bad, while he/she holds top office. Honourable leaders resign or at least offer their resignations. They might consider themselves scapegoats as well, but once confidence is lost, so is leadership. Scapegoat or not, Jack Gilead in his letter urging Mr Prapat to resign was correct. David James Wong We all know excessive drinking causes many problems, but that is not a reason for entirely banning drinking on board trains or at train stations. It is agreeable for short-haul commuter trains, but not for long-distance ones. Many train passengers are leisure travellers who should be allowed to have a few drinks. You can and must control ill-behaved drunk passengers by having responsible railway policemen and conductors on board. RH Suga Do not get me wrong. I fully support the outrage and disgust shown by the public over the rape and murder of a young girl on one of the SRT’s trains and SRT management must be brought to book over this. However, on another point I see no public outrage or senior official ""sackings"" following the completely unacceptable levels of injuries and deaths caused by bus companies for operating unserviceable buses. I think double standards are being employed. After all, it is just as much of a crime to injure or kill people by negligently employing inept, unqualified, unlicensed drivers on all types of public transport. Brian Stocks Re: ""Army backs new BBC service"" BP, July 11. Welcome back BBC if you are going to be a polite guest in the host country. The statement from the NCPO is unfortunate: ""We don’t have any problem as long as they don’t broadcast information that is negative"". All that the BBC should do is not put a stilted view or downright lies on its website. This should not be too difficult as they manage to filter out any unacceptable truths put on to their BBC World News website. RICHARD BOWLER Liliane Landor, head of language services at the BBC World Service, speaking of the launch of the BBC World Service’s new social media service in Thailand claims that one of the fundamental principles of the World Service is to bring impartial and accurate news to countries when they lack it. I would suggest that the exact opposite has been the case with their reporting of recent events in Thailand. The coverage provided by Jonathan Head, BBC correspondent in Bangkok, has been consistently biased and partial with a distorted and misguided, not to say inaccurate, interpretation of the political conflict in this country. I would recommend that the National Council for Peace and Order monitor this service closely to make sure it helps people better understand the current situation and the causes of the discord here. Edward B Duhigg In the continuing discussion about the nature of democracy, the need for elections, and the shape and content of any future Thai constitution, there seems to have been relatively little consideration of the role of ministerial responsibility. Ministerial responsibility is an essential feature of the Westminster system of government. It holds that a minister bears the ultimate responsibility for the actions of his or her ministry or department. This means that if waste, corruption, or any other misbehaviour is found to have occurred within a ministry, the minister is responsible even if that minister had no knowledge of the relevant conduct. Particular ministers are ultimately responsible for all actions of their respective ministries because, even without knowledge of an infraction by subordinates, they approved the hiring and continued employment of those civil servants and of the bureaucracies within which they operated. If misdeeds are found to have occurred in a ministry, the relevant minister is expected to take responsibility and resign. Ministerial responsibility operates as an important mechanism motivating ministers to closely scrutinise the activities within their departments. It also helps ensure that elected officials are answerable and accountable for every government decision. While the doctrine, where it applies, is a constitutional convention rather than a formal legal mechanism, why could it not be included in any future Thai constitution as a formal mechanism encouraging accountability? Perry Whalley People may not be aware of the ""loopholes"" in current laws that encourage the extortion of money from innocent people by certain authorities. I bought my daughter a used motorcycle which was less than a year old and came in the factory colours common to that brand and model. On her recent visit to the government office to renew the tax and insurance she was told her bike was ""illegal"", the book said it was white whereas in reality it was white and green. This seems to imply that on its first registration an error was made that needed to be corrected. But rather than correct the mistake, it was used as a perfect excuse to extract money from the innocent owner. Now what do you do? Take on the whole system, hire a lawyer, declare your innocence and fight the case? At what cost and do you stand a chance of winning? No, you pay the few hundred baht and eat humble pie. I have heard that its now illegal to have a sidecar fitted to a motorbike if it's not in the registration book, which of course is unheard of in any country. Mr Bob’s confrontation over his ""illegal"" fibreglass top on his pickup (PostBag, July 9) makes it sound like the traffic police have devised another new means of extortion. If they are really illegal then thousands of motorbike owners are guilty, not just this one man. Who wants to pay thousands and be the test case? Lungstib A Phuket newspaper recently reported a crackdown on those who overstay their visas in the kingdom. Much of it sounds like a knee-jerk reaction, so familiar in Thailand to every little thing, the mountain out of a molehill thing. Total immigration reform is long overdue from the 90-day reporting to the retirement visa programme. Ninety-day reporting is so unnecessary for many who have lived at permanent addresses for 10 years or more, and it is easier to grant a retirement visa for a two-, three-, five-year period instead of yearly. Immigration reform should also consider getting rid of so many immigration police who do overlapping work. They’d do better being sent back on the beat or traffic control. The Immigration Bureau should also have an anonymous phone number to report immigration police abuse and harassment. Let’s face it. Many do abuse people and they power trip as well. Cola Ridgeback Following the military takeover, it is clear that law and order has returned to Thailand, and the country as a whole is now functional. The lottery mismanagement, Phuket beach unlicensed criminal trade, motorcycle taxis, illegal immigrants, and the control of Pattaya by Eastern European crime syndicates ares now being cracked down on. As a Bangkokian, I would suggest to the new junta that this is only the start, and foremost on their to-do list should be the eradication of street prostitution, the removal of illegal pornography vendors on Sukhumvit, Silom and in other popular tourist areas, control over taxis who park illegally in tourist areas to attract tourists who they fleece, the arrest of street vendors who routinely sell prescription drugs — most of which are fake and dangerous — the list goes on. Criticism of the coup by Western governments is unwarranted. Uniquely, the current standoff in Thailand is not religious, but socio-economic, which makes the problem somewhat easier to solve, as there is no history of deep-rooted hatred or genocide. Democracy currently does not work in Thailand under current conditions, as the minority will never accept the will of the majority. Any electoral reform must be based on one-man, one-vote, but needs to address vote buying and corruption, in order that a clear view of the will of the people can be measured. The junta has made a good start, and I hope that it is able to enforce controls which will allow Thailand to become fully democratic, and enable elections to be held next year. Soi 4 Dave Vendors encroach on pavements, but I don’t find them a big problem. The real everyday danger is the motorcyclists who use the pavements as if they own them! I have lost count of the times I have nearly been hit by one. They also drive on the wrong side of the road and go down one-way streets the wrong way. These include the Post Office delivery motorbikes. At the same time, many paving slabs are broken and uneven. This make it easy to trip over! Allan Benfield Thank you, Matt Davies, for your excellent evaluation of Yuyee’s sentencing posted on July 7. I was also aghast at the draconian sentencing over such a small amount of cocaine found in Yuyee’s possession. One of the admirable traits of Thai people is their understanding and tolerance of human foibles. And who hasn’t got them? Yuyee is well known as a champion of endangered species. Three young children need Yuyee at home. Justice should prevail. Hopefully this case will be subject to a review. I have not lost faith in Thai justice! Laura Ines I agree with David Brown’s appraisal of encouraging ""police bribery on the highways"" (PostBag, July 10); but I also feel sympathy for Mr Bob who highlighted the problem. I have seen a drunken expat being stopped from driving by the police and actually taken home and put to bed by the police! Now the boys in brown (no pun intended David!) may come in for some heavy criticism for not doing too much to correct the horrendous driving here, but would taking a drunk home happen in many other countries around the world? I doubt it very much. Sir Lance I applaud the efforts of the NCPO to empower officials in Phuket to investigate and rectify (hopefully) the widespread and illegal encroachment on public land especially in areas next to the sea. When I first arrived in Phuket in 1995, one could drive on the back road from Laguna resort, past what is now Trisara, all the way to the airport. Along this winding road were several spectacular small beaches open to the public. Many times I drove along the road, parked my car and walked a short distance to a fantastic beach to swim. Over the years these wonderful beaches were cordoned off with barbed wire and signs stating: ""Private property — no trespassing”.  Luxurious villas and hotels eventually closed off all access to these small and picturesque beaches. It was painfully obvious that large developers had won the day with their cash. If, under the auspices of the NCPO, Phuket authorities can determine which of these beautiful areas can be returned to the people of Phuket and to the tourists of the world, Phuket can perhaps once again be called “the Pearl of the Andaman”.

PHOTOS: JOHN hULME The territory of Pol Lt Col Apichart, the officer in charge of the Transnational Crime and Child and Woman Protection Unit of the Royal Thai Police Region 5, covers the eight northern provinces — Chiang Mai, Lamphun, Lampang, Phrae, Nan, Phayao, Chiang Rai and Mae Hong Son — but he has also tracked cases to the Thai border towns of Mae Sot in the west and Hat Yai in the south. In a small windowless office on the banks of the River Ping, Pol Lt Col Apichart scrutinises surveillance footage on a computer monitor that shows a group of men enjoying drinks at one of the city’s popular nightspots. The officer clicks at an icon and another series of photographs fill the screen, this time showing a woman leaning into the window of a car. The next photograph shows a number of mixed gender sex workers trawling for business. Glare from the computer bounces off the police officer’s face as he continues to click pixilated images of young girls and boys onto the screen. The children are victims of a wide range of paedophiles, enabled in many of the cases by local agents or handlers known as nai na. Many are also among the victims of Thailand’s human trafficking problem, which came to the forefront of international attention on June 20 when the US Department of State released its 2014 Trafficking in Persons report. Thailand was dropped into its lowest rank, the Tier 3 category, and the report called Thailand “a source, destination, and transit country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labour and sex trafficking”. The shock waves from the report were sharply felt in Thailand. They came on the back of an investigation by The Guardian into the exploitation of migrant workers used as slave labour in the country’s fishing industry. ‘heart for justice’: Pol Lt Col Apichart Hattasin is on a mission to rid Thailand of sexual predators. The International Labour Organisation states on its website that: “Forced labour in the private economy generates estimates that US$150 billion in illegal profits per year."" The ILO states that forced labour “takes different forms, including debt bondage, trafficking and other forms of modern slavery”. For Pol Lt Col Apichart, the issue is much closer to home. He explains that the woman on the computer screen is under surveillance as she is reputed to be a nai na who “sells” children to paedophiles. The images Pol Lt Col Apichart is analysing add up to months of painstaking covert surveillance in the hope of building a watertight case against the woman. Pol Lt Col Apichart explains that to get a successful arrest and prosecution, one case can take from seven months to two years to collect all the evidence needed. “We can have as many as 20 arrests a month, but to be successful we have to build our case — the ultimate aim is to get a prosecution. Paedophiles, traffickers and ‘handlers’ need to know that there is law and authority operating in this country and it is effective.” He acknowledges that Thailand’s image and reputation need rebuilding. “Thailand is known worldwide as a destination where sex offenders can get anything, and get away with anything. I want these people to think about life in a Thai jail; it’s not going to be a three star hotel experience like jails are in Switzerland. The dark side of what paedophiles are doing is that they are going to jail — they are warned and they should be prepared.” Pol Lt Col Apichart admits that getting a prosecution in the Thai court system is difficult, especially where it involves foreigners. He explains that bail set by a Thai court for an alleged foreign offender is inexpensive and this allows many of the accused to jump bail. “Paedophiles should know it’s not just me alone who is fighting them, it is also the law enforcement agencies in their own country. They see us a developing country and they might think law enforcement is weak and they can get away with their crimes, they think here there are lots of children they can abuse, but be warned we are looking for them, not just the police here, but the police in their own countries.” Pol Lt Col Apichart’s plan is to prosecute foreign paedophiles in Thailand, but if unsuccessful, he has a back-up plan that allows them to be prosecuted back in their own country. “We also prosecute cases with many international law agencies. Wherever these paedophiles come from we have connections, we can and we will utilise the laws in their respective countries to prosecute.” A quick scan of the shelves in Pol Lt Col Apichart’s office confirms his working connections with international law enforcement agencies is more than idle chat or international tokenism. Badges, plaques and certificates of appreciation from a wide range of law agencies commend the work of Pol Lt Col Apichart and his team. A senior Western law enforcement agent, who asked not to be named, paid tribute to Pol Lt Col Apichart’s honesty as a lawman. “Thailand is a hub for everything. It attracts sex tourists and paedophiles that know they can easily escape into neighbouring countries. Lt Col Apichart really is the best because he does it the right way and he’s not corrupt. He’s arrested the whole spectrum — his heart is for justice.” Among the vast collection of certificates spread around the office is Pol Lt Col Apichart’s master's degree in International Security and Terrorism from the UK's Nottingham University. An embossed Certificate of Appreciation that bears the crests of both the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security stands out. The certificate was given to Lt Col Apichart and his team for their involvement in the “US vs Cutler child exploitation investigation”. Robert Cutler was a university lecturer who is alleged to have taken young boys back to his home for sex and his case is now an ongoing investigation in the US. Pol Lt Col Apichart opens more video footage files on his computer that show the arrests of a number of foreign men in hotels while in the company of boys. The men in the videos are from Germany, Switzerland, Australia, Belgium and the US. They include bankers, university lecturers and retirees. “They might think that they can come here and commit crimes and get away with it. If they escape or jump bail here they will be targeted and hunted down by their own police. Paedophiles see our country and our neighbours as easy pickings. It is not just foreign paedophiles, but also local ones,” Pol Lt Col Apichart said while pointing to a video showing a saffron-robed monk opening a door to the police team. Pol Lt Col Apichart acknowledges that there are weak points in the Thai police force and explains that reforms have to be built around decent wages, fairness and justice. “There are many factors — low wages is one of them. If we are bad we will attract bad, and if we are doing good we will attract good people. Everything needs to be transparent and open. We do need institutional reform, but to be successful we have to be willing to reform ourselves. I am proud of my team and the work we do. Our project has already seen reforms within our own ranks. Paedophiles will try anything to get off, including offering bribes.” Pol Lt Col Apichart stresses that building a solid reputation and a network of trusted contacts on the street was crucial to the success off putting paedophiles behind bars. “We use a wide range of equipment that includes surveillance cameras, drones and undercover operatives, but our network is the most important element … the NGOs, the street kids, the community.” MEN IN ROBES red-handed: A Lahu man sits handcuffed in cell after his arrest for involvement in child trafficking. A large blue board fixed to the wall in Pol Lt Col Apichart’s office features five police mug shots of saffron-robed monks that are connected by a thick line that leads to a single mug shot of a man in a white shirt. The five monks were abbots at well-known Chiang Mai temples, until Pol Lt Col Apichart’s team arrested them for sex crimes against minors following a seven-month investigation. “It was difficult to gather evidence and to prove. It was difficult because these people are not ordinary citizens, but people who have special status in the community. There’s no punishment for rogue monks. The law on monks needs to be reformed, the law needs to criminalise the behaviour of these monks. “Getting the bad monks in jail builds our credibility and the trust of abused children. Trust is important in our work. People who give us information must know that the information will not be leaked or backfire on them in any way.” Pol Lt Col Apichart details the operation that resulted in the arrest of the rogue abbots. “The kids being targeted were poor. They were from broken families and had turned to computer game shops for meaning. They need money to play. One of the monks was a pimp, he spotted these kids — he knew where to find them. He picked them up and delivered them to the other monks who used the kids for sex.” Pol Lt Col Apichart’s investigation shows the extent of the planning that paedophiles put into snaring children for sex. “The case against the six monks was initially hard. It was difficult to gather evidence and to prove. The most critical evidence was from the children themselves. We have good street connections. Our network told us that something bad was happening to the kids on the street. We investigated.” Pol Lt Col Apichart pays tribute to the children involved and to the NGOs who helped his team leading up to the arrests. “We had the trust of the children. The success of the case was down to our networks that looked out for kids at risk.” The monks are now in jail awaiting trial, but it could take up to two years to get a prosecution. “The monks have been disrobed. They broke their vows, now they have no status. It was important that they had their status as monks removed to take away their power. This was a difficult case because they are not ordinary citizens, but people who have a very special status — it was more difficult than arresting foreigners.” Pol Lt Col Apichart wants the arrests of the abbots to peel away the veneer of respectability and community esteem that people unquestionably bestow on men in religious robes. “People are naive about what they give their respect to. It makes them blind. I want people to be aware, because bad people use respectful institutions to hide their real intentions. One of the monks we arrested had around 150 of his victims on his camera — they were all young boys.” To stop paedophiles hurting children, Pol Lt Col Apichart wants monks who are aware of the abuse to take responsibility and get in touch with his unit. “These men were not real monks, their actions are those of criminals taking advantage of the robes. Real monks support what we are doing. They know keeping quiet about the bad monks is not working. I want to clean the places that are full of dirt.” His voice drops to a whisper as he considers the wide range of people who target and brutalise children. “It is not just Buddhist monks, but all religions. Paedophiles use religion as a safe haven and to get access to children. My next project is to take down the ‘safe havens’ and expose these false missionaries and monks. My team will apply what we have learned — we have already busted a pastor who will go on trial in September. Years ago when I first started this work most of my cases were foreign paedophiles, now most of my cases are monks. My next project is to clean up the paedophiles, both foreign and local, hiding behind religious robes.” EASY PICKINGS The foreign paedophiles arrested by Pol Lt Col Apichart and his team read like a United Nations listing. Men from Switzerland, Belgium, France, the UK, Italy, Australia and the US have all come to Thailand intent on having sex with children. Pol Lt Col Apichart describes how a French national took the time to build a community profile that gave him access to children. “He raised money to say he was running an NGO providing social services for children, but he was only interested in boys. He picked on the vulnerable and the poor. He selected undocumented Burmese [Myanmar] beggar kids who were extremely quiet because of their status. He went to their family, gave them money and said he would take the boys to his place to be taught. He worked on the kids’ feelings. He took showers with them.” Paedophiles are highly organised individuals or groups of sexual predators, he says. “They have their own community and networks. Paedophiles seek out poverty-stricken countries where children are vulnerable. Paedophiles have set up international networks, newsletters and websites to share photographs, videos and even child victims.” Pol Lt Col Apichart takes time to reflect on what he has just outlined and the details he has left out. A hard edge to his voice adds meaning to his words. “These kids were powerless, illegal [immigration status] in Thailand, not likely to come forward to the police. The Frenchman was rich, smart and confident. Luckily our street network got in touch with us. We have lots of people on the street listening for us. Our team is only 10 strong but our network is proving to be effective.” Pol Lt Col Apichart takes time to point out that not all paedophiles fit into an-easy-to-assemble profile: “It could be anyone. We've arrested monks, priests, even a kid’s father. They could be young or old, rich or poor. We've arrested and jailed a 90-year-old Australian man for repeated abuse of children.” Pol Lt Col Apichart issues a blunt warning to paedophiles intending to come to his patch. brotherly love: The Big Brother school offers abuse victims a safe learning environment. “Paedophiles coming to northern Thailand should be scared, very scared. They should be scared of Thai jails. They are warned and should prepare themselves — they should know Thai jails are not three-star hotels, they are something to fear.” Pol Lt Col Apichart said his links to international law enforcement agencies are real and effective and he and his team will do everything in their power to make sure paedophiles end up in jail. “We coordinate with international immigration agencies, the FBI, Interpol, Homeland Security and other relevant authorities. We have connections with Belgian, Swiss, US, Australian, British and many European law enforcement agencies. ""Wherever these paedophiles come from we have connections, we can and we will utilise the laws in their respective countries to prosecute.” Pol Lt Col Apichart said if paedophiles are under the illusion that they can come to Thailand to commit crimes and get away with it they are making a massive mistake. “If they do escape or jump bail here they will be targeted and hunted down by their own police.” BIG BROTHER During his time making arrests Pol Lt Col Apichart realised that the child victims had little or no resources to call on to help them cope with the trauma they had been subjected to. He said that it was a case involving a sexually abused homeless child that prompted him to do more. “The kid was alone, he had no one. All these street kids come from broken homes and have no one to turn to for help. It was a case of knowing that my responsibility had to go further than just arresting paedophiles. These kids needed my help.” Pol Lt Colonel Apichart found a kindred spirit in Boom (not her real name), a director of the HUG project, social worker and psychologist according to the Criminal Procedure Code. Pol Lt Colonel Apichart points out that as he is an expert in putting paedophiles behind bars and Boom’s and HUG’s aim is to protect children at risk from violence, exploitation and abuse, the collaboration made for an effective team. Both Pol Lt Col Apichart and Boom pay tribute to their teams and the volunteers who put in long hours for the children. “All we lacked was resources and funds. We both want to break the cycle of abuse that these kids are locked in. We want the abuse to stop and we want the abusers in jail.” Boom explains that the HUG acronym stands for hope, understanding and grace and the word hug in the northern Thai Lanna dialect means love. HUG, part of the Big Brother Project, uses a suburban house on the outskirts of Chiang Mai. Rows of big and small footwear indicate large numbers of people are inside. Inside a group of teenagers sit quiet, taking in what two high school teachers are showing them on an overhead projector. The class ends and a teenager with a tattooed face playfully shadow boxes with a burly undercover policeman. On a low wall in the entrance of the house, Boom underlines the size of the task that the Big Brother Project has attempted to tackle. “Eighteen months ago, many of these kids would have been high on glue, none of them could sit still. Most had been kicked out of home or school. We build trust with the kids. We aim to protect these children and offer them a safe environment. These kids do listen to the police because they are authority figures and the relationships have developed to one of trust and friendship.” Boom and Pol Lt Col Apichart now have 16 children aged between 12 and 18 involved in the Big Brother Project. Boom stresses that the project has nothing in common with the Orwellian overtones of its name, but everything to do with its Thai translation — Pi Yai — someone who takes care of you. “The Big Brother Project is run between the police, the Chiang Mai Office of Social Development and Human Security and the HUG Project. Our Big Brother Project is about having someone to look up to, someone to protect you — that’s our definition of pi yai.” Pol Lt Col Apichart chips in and adds to Boom’s words. “When we arrest the paedophile, these children are left stranded but they are in need of very special care. We didn’t know when we started how involved it was going to be. We thought we’d help find them a job or schooling, but we realised we had to go further.” Boom explains that Big Brother provides a transition home to children who are victims of abuse. “The best option for these children is to get them back home — if there is no abuse there. Our staff evaluates the situation and checks out the home environment. The second-best option is to try to get the kids back to school.” Boom admits that resources and funds are low for the Big Brother Project. “Last year we ran on a donation of around 30,000 baht. We rely on 10 volunteers and five members from Lt Col Apichart’s police team. The school that we run twice a week is run from the house of our volunteers, husband and wife Nicole and Mike. The community has helped — the kids get archery, football and guitar lessons and our volunteers donate their time. The Flight of the Gibbon was a special treat and helped to put some fun into the lives of these kids.” Boom points out that most street children are usually afraid of the police, but that the children attending the Big Brother activities are learning to trust and to have healthy attachments. The US Secretary of State’s International Women of Courage Award recently recognised Boom’s work with the children. “It was a honour to be nominated. I didn’t win, but it was still great.” DIRTY DANCING A member of Pol Lt Col Apichart’s undercover team is organising a late-night surveillance at one of the city’s nightspots, popular with tourists and Thais alike. It’s close to midnight. Saturday edges towards Sunday and the good-time crowd moves to find a late-night drinking spot. Tuk-tuks slow in the hope of a late fare. Chinese and European tourists seek cover from the rain that starts to fall. Sex workers tout for business to drivers in slow moving cars that crawl along the city’s tree-lined streets. A small soi renowned for its night bars is pumping. Strobe and fluorescent lighting coupled with loud music pulsate in unison. The crowd spills out of the bar, filling the soi. Small groups shout at each other in the hope of being heard. Older men and women tourists clutch elaborate drinks and sift through the memory banks looking for dance moves. Young female backpackers mimic the dress of the women working the sex bars two blocks away. Fuelled by small buckets of alcohol the women gyrate to an invisible pole while pushing their tongues through a series of mock sexual acrobatics. Young children move between the crowded bars offering jasmine flower garlands for 20 baht to drinkers. The undercover police take up position at a beer garden table to observe a group of young, short-haired Western men they suspect might be arranging to take children back to their hotel. The policeman explains the process. “This work takes time … lots of observation work … getting photographs … talking to the kids. We believe the men select the kid they want, they then leave the bar and arrange for the child to follow them.” The targeted men, unlike most of the crowd, take their time to work their way through their drinks. Eventually, the men leave the bar, and a young policeman in casual clothes follows. Later, Pol Lt Col Apichart explains that foreign paedophiles can blend into tourist sites, hotels and bars without attracting attention. “They come here because of the poverty and its closeness to Laos, Myanmar and Cambodia.” Boom warns that it is important not to stereotype paedophiles, children or the locations as abuse can happen anywhere and can be committed by a wide range of people. “The children can come from a so-called good home, it can happen at school, at swimming pools, sport events and even in bookshops. Paedophiles shift their targets depending on a number of factors.” Boom urges all NGOs and community-based groups to familiarise themselves with Thailand’s Anti-Human Trafficking Laws of 2008 as well as Thailand’s Child Protection Act, as all children, regardless of their status, are protected under them. Boom relates a particular incident that shocked her into compiling a seven-point list that she posted on HUG’s Facebook page of what parents, carers and people working with children should be aware of when dealing with sex abuse. “I wrote it after hearing about an 11-year-old who abused a five-year-old. The 11-year-old boy was being looked after by his single parent — his father. ""The boy was alone at home while his father was away most of the time working. The boy had been exposed to a lot of adult pornography.” Boom’s mood lifts as she talks about one of Big Brother’s success stories, a young woman known as Mint (not her real name) who had been tricked by a trafficker’s promises of money into selling her body for sex. Helped by Big Brother, Mint turned her life around. But Boom admits it was not always easy. “At times Mint relapsed and returned to selling sex five times in three months. But relapses are part of the recovery process. Now Mint chooses to attend school. She is reunited with her family and has testified against two traffickers. She is now back in school and earning high grades.” Trust betrayed: Pol Lt Col Apichart Hattasin with the arrested abbott of a Mae Rim temple.

											Child porn seller arrested in Phuket sentenced to 30 years										",https://search.bangkokpost.com/track/visitAndRedirect?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bangkokpost.com%2Fthailand%2Fgeneral%2F416059%2Fchild-porn-seller-arrested-in-phuket-sentenced-to-30-years&contentId=news416059,"NEWARK, New Jersey - A Ukrainian man who fought extradition for three years from his Thai jail cell has been sentenced to 30 years in prison for running a network of websites that catered to paedophiles around the world. Maksym Shynkarenko was arrested while on vacation in early 2009 by Phuket police, amidst much publicity, but he fought extradition for three years from a Bangkok jail cell. (File photo) Authorities believe Maksym Shynkarenko, now 35, was ""the most significant distributor of child pornography ever prosecuted in the US"". He was arrested in Phuket while on vacation. While he apparently was not involved in paedophile offences during the brief time between his arrival and his arrest in 2009, authorities say he was using proceeds from his paedophile network and money laundering schemes. The sentence passed by US District Judge William Walls on Tuesday was part of a plea deal reached by the Shynkarenko in early January - almost five years after his arrest in Thailand and 18 months after his extradition to the US. He will likely be deported when he is released from prison. ""You have pleaded guilty to one of the most serious crimes imaginable in our culture as human beings,"" Judge Walls told Shynkarenko at the sentencing. ""I can't think of anything more horrific."" Shynkarenko spoke briefly in court Tuesday. ""I want to just say I regret my crime, and I am grateful for the chance to change my life,"" he said. That chance will come in a high-security prison, where he will be kept mostly isolated from the rest of the prison population because of the nature of his crime. After Shynkarenko finally lost his three-year battle against extradition at the Bangkok Criminal Court in January, 2012, US authorities unsealed the indictment of specific charges. It said he traded in tens of thousands of hardcore pornographic images and videos that depicted children, ranging from infants and toddlers to teenagers being graphically sexually assaulted or abused, in most cases by adults. He and associates still at large, presumably in the Ukraine, advertised the websites with names such as ""Illegal.CP,"" ""The Sick Child Room"" and ""Hottest Childporn Garden."" The indictment described statements on the website such as, ""Even if you ever have problems with police, you can always say that someone had stolen the information from your credit card and used it. It is very difficult to establish that you were the person to pay."" Authorities say Shynkarenko, 33, was able to operate with virtual impunity out of the Ukraine, long a leading source of child pornography, because of the country's lax law enforcement against paedophiles, as well as its rampant political corruption. The poor economy was a contributor, as well. Food or candy reportedly was often good enough to get a child to participate in the production of hardcore photos or videos. Some material was even sold openly on the street. Shynkarenko's arrest was made with great local fanfare by Phuket police Jan 23, 2009. Tourist Police Commander Attakrit Thaneechat and Phuket Provincial Police Commander Apirak Hongtong held a press conference, where they produced the Ukrainian, in a white shirt and a hangdog look. Shynkarenko was arrested at his rented village in Chalong, Phuket. Officers of two US agencies went along to observe, as guests of the police. He was detained under a warrant from the Criminal Court, issued on Jan 21. Shortly after his arrest, he was transferred to the Bangkok Remand Prison to arrange extradition. Though it was not divulged how much money Shynkarenko made from the websites, the US attorney's office said he was charging $79.99 (about 2,400 baht at the time) for a 20-day subscription. Authorities seized a subscriber list that numbered in the thousands. The US attorney's office said after the sentencing session that the investigation into a website that Shynkarenko operated between 2005 and 2008 led to the criminal convictions of more than 600 US residents in 47 states. The probe was initiated after agents from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Homeland Security Investigations, found the website through emails sent from a computer in New Jersey. ""Shynkarenko worked the supply side of a market that sells images of the most depraved, predatory abuse of children,"" US Attorney Paul Fishman said. When the Ukrainian was escorted by US marshals from Bangkok to New Jersey in 2012, the prosecutor said that, ""Shyknarenko's extradition from Thailand to a New Jersey courtroom is a milestone in one of our most important fights – keeping our children safe from harm."" The US charged Shyknarenko with 16 counts of transportation and shipment of child pornography; 12 counts of advertising child pornography; and one count each of conspiracy to advertise, transport and ship child pornography; engaging in a child exploitation enterprise and money laundering. ""Distributors and consumers of child pornography create a market for sexual assaults on children, where the victimisation of those children is refreshed with every download,"" Mr Fishman said. Judge Walls said Tuesday he wouldn't oppose a request by defence attorney Nicholas Wooldridge to have the approximately three-and-a-half years Shynkarenko was jailed in Thailand deducted from his 30-year sentence. But he rejected Wooldridge's argument that Shynkarenko deserved a greater reduction because of the deplorable conditions of Thai jails. Mr Wooldridge characterised his client Shynkarenko as a ""smart guy"" who earned a degree from a technical college in Ukraine and who used his knowledge of computers to run the network of websites described in the indictment. He said Shynkarenko wasn't involved in the production of child pornography. Three victims who appeared in images disseminated by Shynkarenko filed claims against him, though one has since withdrawn the claim, Assistant US Attorney Mark McCarren said in court Tuesday. Shynkarenko has no assets in Thailand or the US, McCarren told the judge."

A man walks past advertisement of porn animation DVDs in front of a second-hand DVD shop in Tokyo on June 4, 2014 The upper house of parliament overwhelmingly voted in favour of a bill revising laws under which only the production and distribution of child pornography were banned. The legislation cleared the lower house earlier this month. Campaigners had long urged Japan to toughen its stance on child pornography. The new legislation bans possession of photographs and videos depicting real children aged below 18; it does not include drawings. The law says anyone who ""possesses child pornography for the purpose of satisfying his/her sexual interest"" faces being punished with imprisonment of up to one year, or a fine of up to one million yen ($9,800). In order to encourage disposal of material, the penalties will be delayed for one year after the revised law comes, which is expected possibly in July. The law excludes ""manga"" comics, ""anime"" video and computer-generated graphics, following calls to protect freedom of expression. Japan was the only member of the G7 group of industrialised nations where the possession of child porn remained legal. It is banned and subject to penalties in more than 70 countries. Japan has a large pornography industry, and visitors to the country note the ubiquity of sexual imagery and the huge volume of material available. While it is unusual to see people openly reading paedophilic manga in public, mainstream comics read by commuters sometimes contain sexualised images that many visitors find unpalatable. Despite calls for manga imagery to be included in the new rules, there was strong resistance from manga artists, free-speech advocates and publishers, who said it would impinge on freedom of expression and allow authorities to make arbitrary decisions about art. Strong societal memories of strict state censorship in the run up to Japan's disastrous entry into World War II play into such debates, with dissenters warning of the danger of allowing the government to control the press."

Facebook and Twitter have become popular ways of organising major political street protests in the Philippines. The law was passed in 2012 but its implementation was suspended after coming under challenge from various groups.

Manga images, while they might be mere drawings, can be considered pornographic under internationally shared norms, said Hiromasa Nakai, spokesman for the Japan committee for UNICEF. ""Many people agree that there are horrible manga images are out there and they need to be dealt with,"" he said. The move to tighten rules on sales of explicit material to children came partially in response to criticism from foreign campaign groups. But it faced resistance at home from manga artists, free-speech advocates and publishers, who said it would impinge on freedom of expression and allow authorities to make arbitrary decisions about art. Strong societal memories of strict state censorship in the run up to Japan's disastrous entry into World War II play into such debates, with dissenters warning of the danger of allowing the government to control the press."

											When the rescue causes harm										",https://search.bangkokpost.com/track/visitAndRedirect?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bangkokpost.com%2Fthailand%2Fspecial-reports%2F409127%2Fwhen-the-rescue-causes-harm&contentId=news409127,"A visit by Chantawipa Apisuk and a group of sex workers to a Thai shelter for girls rescued from prostitution last April is a memory she will never forget. PHOTOS: BANGKOK POST ARCHIVE In the morning they had tried to speak to a young girl who seemed anxious to talk to the 66-year-old director of the Empower Foundation, whose members include sex workers from the Mekong region. Empower makes annual visits to offer emotional and material support to the 300 inhabitants of the Kredtrakarn Protection and Occupational Development Centre in Nonthaburi province, the majority of whom are under 18. “The children there are told not to talk to visitors, but one in particular looked extremely desperate to talk to us. I could see that she was very afraid,” Ms Chantawipa said. “When the guards weren’t looking, I told her to write down the phone number of her relatives so that we could talk to them.” Ms Chantawipa’s instinct that something was wrong was correct. When she turned on the television that evening she learned that 10 girls had tried to escape from the centre. Two drowned in the river surrounding the shelter; one of the victims was the girl she had met earlier that day. “I thought that maybe it was our fault, that our presence made her think about her family and freedom,” Ms Chantawipa said. “But then I realised that it wasn’t our fault. Detaining them against their will is not right.” Last year, the centre was home to 160 Thai women and girls and 140 from Laos, Myanmar, Cambodia and Vietnam. They are detained there while court cases proceed against those who have allegedly exploited them in the sex industry. Ms Chantawipa said for foreign women held in the shelters, sometimes for years in “prison-like” conditions, it is another indignity when considering what they have been through as young victims of human trafficking. PROTECTED AND PUNISHED? The recruitment or transportation of a child below the age of 18 for the purpose of exploitation is automatically considered human trafficking under the UN Trafficking Protocol. This means that in a trafficking situation, when one rescues a child, there is no need to prove that they were tricked or lured. Many NGOs cooperate with the police to conduct rescue missions, but Eaklak Loomchomkhae, director of missing persons for the Mirror Foundation, said it is important to be able to verify there is a victim before such operations occur. Often the victim cannot be identified, and some do not want help. “What we do is we ask the caller to go back to the child and ask him or her to come on the phone,” Mr Eaklak said. “What we don’t want to do is interfere with those who are working voluntarily and are over 18 years of age.” The police receive reports through three channels — via the 1191 hotline for human trafficking, from the victim’s relatives who have been contacted by phone or social media and by police investigation. After conducting raids, the police work with the Ministry of Social Development and Human Security to identify victims of human trafficking. Questioning of the victims is done by social workers and psychologists. Pol Col Chitpop Tomuan, a superintendent at the Anti-Human Trafficking Division of the Royal Thai Police, said the government tries to fast-track cases involving trafficked children and, in all cases, advanced examination of the witnesses is done instead of the usual practice of first gathering evidence. “In the past we admit that there have been problems [concerning lengthy procedures], but we have asked the courts to give priority to cases related to child trafficking,” Pol Col Chitpop said. But NGOs say children who are apprehended do not want to be identified as victims of trafficking, and most want to return home as soon as possible. Ms Chantawipa said rescue missions do more harm than good because, after the raids, the children are confined to shelters against their will. At the government-administered Kredtrakarn, children are forced to cut their hair short and wear uniform-like clothing. Visitors are not allowed to give food directly to the children, she said. “It seems like the shelter staff do not want us to visit. It’s basically a prison, and I can’t think of a reason why we need a shelter,” she said. “By making the children learn how to sew clothes and style hair, it’s like a punishment.” Kredtrakarn’s director was not available for comment. The Bureau of Anti-Trafficking in Women and Children did not respond to interview requests. taking a stand: Empower Foundation director Chantawipa Apisuk says girls rescued from sex work still face tough obstacles, including virtual imprisonment in shelters. Lily, a member of the Empower Foundation, said that during a trip to Kredtrakarn in April last year she saw a young Vietnamese woman who had been at the shelter for four years. “I walked into the basket-weaving room and saw a Vietnamese woman, probably in her twenties, crying. She said she didn’t know where to go after being released. And then the staff came and told her not to cry in front of the kids,” Lily said. Some who have avoided being confined in the government centres have sought temporary shelter with Empower by studying Thai and English, attending courses in health, labour and immigration law. “First we wanted to teach law, but what they [sex workers] really wanted to learn was how to say ‘hello’, ‘I love you’, ‘I want your money’, ‘my father died’, ‘my buffalo died,’ ” Ms Chantawipa said at Empower’s office in Patpong. Ms Chantawipa believes that language helps people make decisions and minimise exploitation. For the past 30 years, Empower has provided support and access to education to more than 30,000 sex workers in Thailand. She estimates that there are about 300,000 female sex workers nationwide, of which a third are either male or transgender. ROAD TO RECOVERY Hagar Cambodia is an NGO based in Phnom Penh that provides assistance to women and children who are victims of human trafficking. One of its staff said survivors of sex trafficking may experience anxiety and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. Suicidal and self-harming behaviours are also common among adolescents. Another social worker based in Bangkok who has worked extensively with human trafficking victims across the region for 13 years defended shelters as necessary steps to rehabilitation. “This is why they [the children] need to be placed in shelters — to provide total protection and to foster an environment where they can reflect on their thoughts and recover,” said the social worker, who requested anonymity. Government shelters use three guiding principles to determine whether or not a child should be sent home, she said. These three conditions include a safe environment at home, continued services at home and a partner (usually an NGO) that can guarantee the first two conditions. In some cases, the children return to Thailand after being repatriated. “Many children have asked me to leave them alone, but what I ask them to think about is whether they will be proud of what they are doing once they are mothers,” said the social worker. “We want them to have safer and more sustainable jobs.” Hagar Cambodia said that while voluntary entry into prostitution suggests free will, at times women enter this sector of work because of dire economic need and a lack of alternatives. Voluntary entry into prostitution can also lead women and girls into abusive situations, such as being forced to work long hours, receiving very little or no payment, being held against their wishes, being forced to have sex and being abused physically. PROGRESS REPORT Every year, the US publishes a Trafficking In Persons (TIP) report, and Thailand’s is due to be released next month. Under the TIP system, countries are ranked in three tiers. Tier-1 countries that meet all the minimum standards, Tier-2 countries that do not meet the minimum standards but are making significant efforts to do so, and Tier-3 countries that do not meet the standards and are not making significant efforts to do so. Thailand has been in the Tier-2 bracket for four years, and it was feared the country would be moved to Tier-3 this year, because last year’s TIP report expressed dismay at Thailand’s slow progress in prosecuting human trafficking cases. Ms Chantawipa said Thai police were casual about enforcing laws, but annually made a concerted effort during a three-month period to reach arrest targets to give the impression that they were cracking down on human trafficking. “March to May is when the police are ready to go out to the border areas and conduct raids,” Ms Chantawipa said. It is well known that massage parlours and some karaoke bars and pubs are prostitution venues, and the penalty for employing children is up to 2,000 baht under the Entertainment Act. Ms Chantawipa claimed that around 500 bars in and around Patpong, a well-known entertainment district, pay 20,000 baht per month as bribes to the police to avoid being shut down for any reason. Pol Col Chitpop said police conduct crackdowns on human trafficking all year round — not just three months as Ms Chantawipa claims — but admitted there has been some pressure to increase the number of cases on an annual basis, although no specific target has been set. He said the US TIP report is mostly concerned about trafficked labour working in factories rather than the sex industry. The Anti-Human Trafficking Division last year reported a total of 102 cases of human trafficking for sexual purposes involving people under the age of 18, of which 28 were Thai nationals. In 2012, the figure was 66, of which 26 were Thais. Thailand has three main laws to deal with human trafficking; the Penal Code, the Prevention and Suppression of Prostitution Act and the 2008 Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act. Overall, the penalties for the prostitution of children range from one year to life imprisonment and include the death penalty for cases of extreme exploitation and violence. Mark Capaldi, a senior researcher at End Child Prostitution, Child Pornography and Trafficking of Children for Sexual Purposes, said Thailand has a very strong legal framework, but there is a need to commit to providing specialised services to victims after rescue. This includes shelters, psychological counselling and medical services. Meanwhile, the services do not differentiate between adults and children, as well as labour and prostitution, which need different care and protection services, Mr Capaldi said. The majority of shelters worldwide are open shelters that allow children to leave; adopting the same method in Thailand should be an option due to the long legal process, he said. According to Australia’s Anti-People Trafficking Interdepartmental Committee, where a suspected victim chooses not to help law enforcement authorities or the person’s evidence is insufficient to help a trafficking investigation or prosecution, the person is assisted in returning to their home country. This is not the case in Thailand. UNCONVENTIONAL PRACTICES As awareness-raising campaigns improve, Mr Capaldi said children are being pushed to alternative places that tend to be a little more hidden and not commercial sex venues. But while much of the attention in Thailand is given to sex tourism, the majority of commercial exploitation in any country involved local men, he said. Some websites contain information on the names and locations of sex establishments masked as massage parlours. On the websites some of the men openly exchange information about where to acquire underage sex workers. Mr Eaklak of the Mirror Foundation, who has been monitoring these online activities, said users provide “treasure maps” on web boards to gain acceptance and appreciation among community members. “In the internet world, those who give out these locations are considered godlike. They even use the phrase ‘having the same wife’ as the poster,” said Mr Eaklak, adding that many of them mention underage Lao girls. The keyword for child prostitutes is “aunts and grandmas”, so a “70-year-old aunt” would be a 17-year-old girl. They will also type “L” for “Lolita”, or a child under the age of 18. A post on one website under the username “papakung” said he uses a fake Facebook account for targeting underage girls. “Do not have free sex. Agree on a rate. This is important because if the target is an aunt [underage girl], it is illegal and you have to find an easy way to get out of it. Having free sex might foster a relationship that is deeper than selling and buying,” he writes. Where there is demand, there is supply. Thailand ratified the UN Trafficking Protocol in October, but that does not necessarily mean the number of victims will fall. While this shows Thailand has committed itself legally to international standards around prevention, protection and support, and services given to children for recovery and integration, Mr Capaldi said globalisation will make the migration of adolescents even more of an issue due to the greater poverty gap in some parts of the world. Migration can increase the recruitment of children into trafficking for sexual exploitation, as traffickers operate along migration routes. As education and awareness levels in Thailand improve, there will be a likely decrease in trafficking of Thai children, Mr Capaldi said, but there could be an increase from neighbouring countries, with a trend for more Lao girls trafficked in the entertainment sector. Mr Eaklak shared similar observations, saying that there is a large demand for Lao children as they were cheaper to hire and considered beautiful by Thai customers because of their light complexion. Mr Eaklak also said many of the Lao sex workers were able to communicate with their Thai customers."

Karl Joseph Kraus died on Thursday while awaiting trial on charges of raping four sisters aged between 7 and 15 at his home in Doi Saket, according to the Phuket News. Seated in a wheelchair, Kraus made his first court appearance iin Chiang Mai on April 30 last year. His lawyers argued that he was not fit to stand trial because he was suffering from dementia and cancer. Kraus was originally arrested in 2010. Parents of the four sisters claimed he had lured the girls to his house by offering them English lessons, money, and chocolate. Germany-born Kraus, a former railway worker from Sydney who lived for a time in Western Australia, was accused of abusing the four sisters for almost two years. Arresting officers also found child pornography on Kraus's computer. Authorities said he faced up to 20 years in jail if convicted. He pleaded not guilty to rape and sexual assault. Following his arrest Kraus was granted bail of 400,000 baht but fled to Myanmar. Authorities there arrested him in August 2012 for lacking a valid visa and sent him back to Thailand, where he was locked up for jumping bail."

If the country's status slips to Tier 3, the lowest level, Thailand will risk more stringent trade sanctions and be denied financial assistance. Borvornan Thongkalaya, senior executive vice-president for human resources of Mitr Phol Group, said the company backs the government on this issue. ""The tier assessment will be known by the end of this year whether some or all of the industry will be taken off the Watch List,"" he said. ""Despite the government taking the lead on this, we have monitored this problem and hope Thailand will be removed [from the list] eventually,'' said Mr. Bovornan Thailand is facing child labour issues in five sectors — sugarcane, shrimp, fisheries, textiles and pornography. The government has been trying to improve the country's status by cooperating with the private sector to tackle the problem. Mr Bovornan said since last year Mitr Phol has adopted eight steps of labour management including leading participatory efforts among all stakeholders, risk identification and assessment, and independent reviews by governmental and other sectors to ensure no child, illegal and forced labour is used in its business. The measures involve its 5,700 employees and 37,000 contracted farmers. Besides, progress in promoting child labour prevention at its factories and farms have been reported to the Ministry of Labour and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as a model to tackle the issue in the sugar industry. Mr Borvornan said that there could have been misinterpretations from the Western perspective on the classification of child labour as children normally accompany their parent to sugar plantation areas."

On one hand, it is good to know what others honestly think. On the other, the truth can be downright terrifying, such as the issue of paedophilia, or sexual attraction to children. The topic is nothing new — newspaper headlines are constant reminders of its existence in our society. Before the internet boom, we only heard condemning words about these criminals. Now the way people communicate has changed and evil thoughts emerge behind facelessness on social media. The recent talk about Iraq’s draft law to allow girls as young as nine years old to marry has raised a few eyebrows in Thailand, not only the law itself but in the way some Thais reacted to the news. There are raunchy comments, for example, on a Facebook page called “Loli Little”, a reference to Lolita, a novel in which the adult male protagonist is obsessed with a 12-year-old girl. Some of the users praised the idea and said they hoped Thailand would consider legalising child marriage, as well. Some even joked that they would fly to Iraq so they could legally sleep with a nine-year-old. While it is unfathomable whether the comments were honest opinions or merely sick jokes, the discussion highlighted the fact that there are people who find young children sexually attractive. Some compare sexual attraction to children to homosexuality. “In the past, people did not accept homosexuals, but today same sex marriage is fine,” reads one comment on the page. “Sexual preference is a personal choice. What’s wrong with being attracted to young children?” Nothing scares parents of young children more than the realisation that there are ill-minded people out there who would harm their kids. But ironically, what modern day parents do can actually put their children in danger — the simple act of posting pictures of their children online, equipped with location and personal information — may not be as cute as they intend. Kanya*, whose two-year-old girl is adored by her friends, finds it perfectly harmless to post pictures of her daughter on Facebook, tagging the young girl’s fans in each of the picture. On an average, she posts two pictures a day, mostly generic pictures of her girl doing daily activities such as eating, talking a walk, sleeping and taking a bath completely naked. “I set my Facebook privacy to private so I am not worried that strangers will see the pictures or steal them,” said the mother. When asked whether she knew for sure that the friends she tagged had the same privacy setting for their accounts, she could not answer. When asked whether she ever thought of the possibility that paedophiles might get hold of the pictures of her daughter in the bath tub, she drew a blank and admitted she never thought of that. She is not alone. Most parents today post pictures and videos of their children on social media. Their reasons include wanting to keep friends and family members updated about the child’s life, as well as mental hunger for “Likes” to prove their own or their child’s popularity. Anchalee*, who has a half-European daughter, also thinks that opening a Facebook account for her daughter and posting pictures of her one-year-old would lead the child to stardom. “I’ve seen many mothers posting pictures of their adorable children on Pantip’s parenting forum or who have fanpages on Facebook, and their children become famous,” she said. “I hope my daughter can one day become a child model, too. That’s why I started this fanpage.” Maja Cubarrubia, country director at Plan International (Thailand), said that parents and the society need to acknowledge that technology and social media are here to stay. There will always be technological advances that will influence people’s ways of connecting and relating with the rest of the world. “Technology, and that includes social media, is now the new tool for learning and if used properly, it can help children and young people reach their full potential and become productive members of society,” said Cubarrubia. “But we need to be aware that there are bad people around who can hurt children and young people, whether virtually on Facebook or elsewhere.” A simple Google search can reveal the ugly side of the world. There are many web boards and sites containing child porn and disgusting, perverted sexual comments about such pictures. Unfortunately, many parents are not even aware of this twilight zone. Pictures of your children can end up there, because in cyberspace, nothing is ever truly private. “Facebook has privacy settings and has guidelines around protection. Having said that, there are really mean people who can still hack the system and create problems for any Facebook user,” warned Cubarrubia. “Those who really want to do something bad will always find ways to steal them and do with them whatever it is they wish to do. I think parents need to be aware that in this day and age, with the technological development around, nothing will really remain private.” Suchada* posted a picture of her daughter swimming over two years ago. One day, her friend sent her a link that shocked her. “It was an online swimsuit shop and it used my daughter’s picture. I was horrified to see that. I would not want the world to see me in a swimsuit and I felt really bad that I exposed my daughter to such a thing. I have no idea how they got that picture, but I only posted it on Facebook. I contacted the website and although they did not reply, they took down the picture.” The public at large is sometimes not aware enough of paedophilia, and many children’s activities do not take it into account. There are photo contests urging parents to submit pictures of their children in swimsuits or in the shower to win prizes, and many parents happily oblige. Most of them don’t even bother to ask how the pictures will be used. If you think it is a far-fetched matter that won’t happen to your child, here are a few examples of what online posting can lead to. In 2012, a Boston CBS station reported that Facebook photos of local teenage girls were copied and posted on a pornography website. And it’s not only paedophiles who might have their eyes on those pictures — your enemies could use your child as revenge. In 2012, it was reported that a teenager, angry at a reporter about underage drinking, harassed and threatened the reporter’s children via Facebook and at school. Such cases have not yet been reported in Thailand, but they can happen anywhere in the world. “Just like many countries, it is not unthinkable that there will be cases in Thailand of bullying of young people because of what has been posted on social media or pictures of naked children being sold to paedophiles, for example,” Cubarrubia said. “With detailed information on a child, ill-meaning people can track them down and do physical harm, or can use the information for things that will benefit them without the child or the family knowing anything about it.” * Names have been changed to protect privacy. - Never create a Facebook account for your children. Never put personal information on Facebook, including your child’s full name, birth date, daily routines and whereabouts. - Checking in is actually a pointless thing to do. There is no need to tell the world where you are. Nothing good comes out of it and you might be providing stalkers with crucial information. - Never take pictures of your children naked, such as while taking a shower, or wearing a swimsuit. These pictures only embarrass your children later. Ask yourself — if my child could decide, would he or she post this picture? - On Facebook, if you post pictures of your child, do not tag people, because you never know their privacy setting. Only post pictures on private platforms. Do not post them on public forums or send pictures to “contests”. Even with big companies, there is no guarantee that they will protect your pictures."

Children will be able to submit grievances under an ""optional protocol"" to the convention. The protocol allows children, or those representing children, to file formal complaints with the UNCRC in Geneva, Switzerland, after they have exhausted all efforts to seek justice in their home country. If the UNCRC rules a violation of children’s rights has taken place, the committee will ask the government take action to remedy the situation, according to children's charity Unicef Thailand. The Convention on the Rights of the Child, which was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1989, sets out the fundamental rights of children and the steps UN member states must take to guarantee those rights. Thailand is one of 193 countries that have ratified the treaty to date. Optional protocols act as supplementary additions to treaties, and are open to ratification by countries party to the main treaty. Thailand was the first country in the world, and so far the only in Asia, to ratify the optional protocol allowing children to submit complaints to the UNCRC committee in Geneva. Albania, Bolivia, Costa Rica, Gabon, Germany, Monténégro, Portugal, Slovakia and Spain had also ratified it as of the end of March. “Unicef would like to congratulate Thailand for ratifying this very important treaty and for being the first country in the world to do so,” said Bijaya Rajbhandari, Unicef representative for Thailand. “It was a major and admirable act on the government’s part and it clearly shows Thailand’s leadership in promoting and protecting the rights of children."" Rarinthip Sirorat, director-general for child protection at the Ministry of Social Development and Human Security, said the government will work closely with local and international charities and national human rights bodies to handle complaints under the protocol. She added that the department would meanwhile strengthen its existing child protection system in order to provide improved services to the most vulnerable. “In ratifying this optional protocol, Thailand further committed itself to promote and protect the rights of children,” said Ms Rarinthip. “The government and its partners will work hard to improve services for children and to find solutions for those whose rights are still being threatened or violated. In addition, we need to ensure that children are aware of their rights and can fully participate in the protecting their rights.” Thailand has also ratified optional protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child regarding the involvement of children in armed conflict, trafficking, prostitution and pornography."

He also faces additional counts of accessing child pornography.     Neil became known notoriously as the ""swirly face"" paedophile because of the way he had altered his image online. The Canadian taught in several Asian countries before being first arrested in northeastern Thailand in October 2007 following an international manhunt after hundreds of photos of him allegedly engaging in sex acts with young boys were discovered on the Internet. Neil was arrested in Thailand after Interpol unscrambled swirled digital images from about 200 internet photos, which showed Neil engaging in sexual acts with boys.      He released from prison in Thailand and returned to Canada in 2012 under strict conditions meant to protect children, but he pleaded guilty to breaching a condition last year after police found him with a laptop in breach of his conditions.     Police said the latest apprehension was the result of investigations by both RCMP Integrated Child Exploitation and Vancouver city police. In September 2012, Thai officials in Thailand confirmed that evidence provided by Canadian police in their case had not been used in their prosecution. Canadian investigators working with prosecutors reviewed their findings and conducted follow up investigations. "

The Philippines has been identified as a hotspot for operations of syndicates involved in the child cybersex industry, where live images of children forced to commit sex acts are streamed online for paedophiles overseas. In January, the National Telecommunications Commission directed Internet service providers to install filters to block access to child pornography as mandated by a 2009 law."

In this file photo taken on March 20, 2012, Philippine President Benigno Aquino speaks during an interview with AFP at the Malacanang Palace in Manila	 The Cybercrime Protection Act was passed in 2012 to stamp out online scourges such as fraud, identity theft, spamming and child pornography, but its implementation was suspended after coming under challenge from various groups. However the Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled that one of its most controversial provisions, the section which penalises cyber libel, ""is not unconstitutional"". Aquino defended the ruling, saying the law would not be used to stifle dissent in the Philippines, considered to be one of Asia's most freewheeling democracies. ""Will freedom of expression be stopped? I don't think that is the purpose of the law,"" Aquino told reporters. ""We were taught in school that your rights end where they impinge on the right of others."" Opponents say the law gives the government sweeping powers to curb Internet freedom due to provisions that impose heavy prison terms for online libel -- in a country where major protests have been organised through Facebook and Twitter. Aquino insisted that the law should apply equally to digital platforms. ""If there was libel on TV, said on radio and written in the newspaper, should that be exempted in another format?"" he said. ""But I repeat, if you are saying the truth, why would you fear libel?"" While the Supreme Court ruled against a provision giving authorities sweeping powers to shut down websites or record Internet traffic data in real time, it upheld the online libel provisions. Critics fear the government could misuse the law to go after journalists who report on official corruption. ""By extending the reach of the antediluvian libel law into cyberspace, the Supreme Court has suddenly made a once infinite venue for expression into an arena of fear, a hunting ground for the petty and vindictive, the criminal and autocratic,"" the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines said in a statement. Rights group Amnesty International also criticised the law, saying ""it rolls back protections for free speech in the Philippines."" ""It is not farfetched that the cyber libel provision will be used against anyone seeking state and corporate accountability for abuses and violations of human rights,"" it said in a statement. Groups opposed to the law are set to file a motion for reconsideration but the Supreme Court only rarely reverses its decisions."

The  Supreme Court said however that one of its most controversial provisions, the section which penalises cyber libel, ""is not unconstitutional"", spokesman Theodore Te said. Only the sender of the material faced prosecution and not the recipient, Te added. The court also upheld provisions penalising cyber-squatting, computer fraud, identity theft and gaining illegal access through a computer, he said. Opponents of the law could still file a motion for reconsideration, Te added. Justice Secretary Leila de Lima said the Supreme Court decision was ""timely"" as the government needed it to deal with the growing number of cybercrime cases.

""A clear legal framework is necessary to protect citizens and balance the state's duties."" - Fight not over - But Neri Colmenares, a congressman who was among those who challenged the law, said they may appeal. ""The government should not be the prosecutor of stained reputations,"" Colmenares said, branding it a ""draconian law"". ""No one should go to prison just for expressing oneself, specially on the Internet, where people express their frustration with government,"" he said. President Benigno Aquino signed the law in 2012 but opponents quickly said it gave the government wide powers to curb Internet freedom due to provisions that impose heavy prison terms for online libel.  The original law also gave the state power to shut down websites and monitor online activities, in a country where major protests have been organised through Facebook and Twitter. The Supreme Court on Tuesday ""partially granted the relief"" sought by the law's opponents, when it ruled as unlawful a provision giving the Justice Department powers to shut down websites or record Internet traffic data in real time.

An employee of the National Bureau of Investigation carries confiscated desktop computers allegedly used for cybersex crime, at the NBI headquarters in Manila on January 29, 2014	 The raids came after police said this month the Philippines had become a major source of pornographic content in the fast-growing child cybersex industry, and vowed to crack down on those involved. The raids took place overnight Tuesday on two Manila businesses that used nude pictures of children, as well as adults, to entice people online to subscribe to pornographic websites, the National Bureau of Investigation said. ""They were caught in flagrante (in the act of wrongdoing),"" Ronald Aguto, head of the bureau's cybercrime unit, told AFP, in reference to the 11 Filipinos who had been detained. ""Some of the computers contained child pornography as well as adult pornography."" Some of the nude photographs on the computers were of unidentified Filipino children aged about 12-16, according to Aguto. He said the suspects faced potential child pornography and human trafficking charges against the suspects, although authorities still needed to investigate the case further. Aguto said the business model involved staff chatting online with people overseas, showing them pornographic photos, in a bid to lure them into buying website subscriptions. The businesses received a commission of $5 for each subscription, and together cleared more than $8,000 a day, according to Aguto. The government pledge to crack down on child cybersex operations came after British and Australian police announced this month they had dismantled a paedophile ring that streamed live sexual abuse of Filipino children over the Internet. Philippine police subsequently said the country was one of the world's biggest sources of live streaming of child sex abuse, with children performing acts in front of webcams to online paedophiles in an industry worth billions of dollars. Poverty and the promise of easy money had seen some Filipino parents allowing their children to be abused online for the paying audience, they added. Aguto said Wednesday authorities had not found evidence of video streaming on the computers seized in the Manila raids."

Mothers accompany their children to a day care center, next to the now abandoned house (back) that used to streamed live sex acts of children to paedophiles around the world, in Ibabao village, Cebu provnce, in central Philippines on January 21, 2014	 The depraved scenes in the bungalow were being repeated in many homes throughout Ibabao, a secluded community on Cebu island where Internet child pornography had for some of its 5,000 residents become more lucrative than fishing or factory work. ""In the beginning I was shocked, I could not believe this was happening in my town,"" mayor Adelino Sitoy told AFP last week, shortly after police announced they had cracked a global live-streaming paedophile ring in which Ibabao was a key source of the child pornography. But while the village is currently in the spotlight, authorities and child rights advocates say the fast-growing global industry is infecting many parts of the mostly poor Philippines, with thousands of children having been abused. At first look the coastal community of Ibabao, 550 kilometres (340 miles) south of Manila, is a typical close-knit rural Philippine village, where many of the long-time residents are relatives or enjoy close and longstanding ties.  In scenes echoed across the devoutly Catholic Philippines, its residents regularly attend masses held in quaint chapels along narrow footpaths and dirt roads. But police and authorities said that behind the closed doors of the tiny wooden and brick homes, many parents directed their children for sex videos in front of webcams connected via the Internet to paying paedophiles overseas. Other children were lured into the homes of neighbours and forced to perform sex acts in front of webcams, they said. Sitoy said the trade thrived because children were locked secretly inside homes, as well as Ibabao's remote location and the fact some elected village leaders with relatives involved ignored the crimes. But some of the videos eventually found their way into the computer files of a known British paedophile two years ago, triggering a global manhunt to track down the perpetrators. The British man was convicted in March last year and sentenced to eight years in prison. Shortly afterwards police in the Philippines began carrying out raids in Ibabao and nearby areas with the help of British, Australian and US authorities. One of the raids saw dozens of Filipino police and social workers break into the bungalow next to the day care centre in September last year, arresting a couple and rescuing their three children, aged three, nine and 11. Two days later, 13 other children who were being abused in other Ibabao homes were rescued, according to Philippine police. Residents are generally wary of outsiders but some allowed AFP to interview them on condition of anonymity. They said ""cybersex dens"" remained in operation, but security fears and the Filipino tradition of not interfering with a neighbour's affairs helped to ensure that people did not pry further or try to stop it. Housewife Jennifer Canete, 38, was willing to talk openly about the crimes, confirming many people in the community were involved and that she feared her four young children could become victims. Canete said one of her children attended the nursery located next to the house where the three children were being abused. ""We were angry that this could happen just near the day care,"" she said. ""I was also afraid, we didn't know what could happen to our children if they went to school because there were many here who were doing that."" Authorities say they do not know exactly when the trade arrived in Ibabao. But, according to local social workers, a Filipina woman from outside the community believed to belong to an organised crime group relocated to the village several years ago and introduced locals to the get-rich-quick scheme. That woman taught residents how to scout for clients in pornographic chat rooms and receive payments through international money transfers, according to the social workers, who did not want to be named for security reasons. Some operators lured friends of their children into their homes and abused them, threatening to harm their parents if they told anyone, the social workers said. One parent told AFP a neighbour who had tried to recruit her said clients paid as much as 100 dollars a session, a fortune in a region where the minimum daily wage is the equivalent of about seven dollars. She said the neighbour justified the trade by saying that no actual physical contact took place.  ""I was angry. We were always taught to protect and love our children,"" the woman said. ""We are not rich, but we are also not poor and desperate. It was an evil thing to do."" Nevertheless, she said that staying silent and steering clear of those involved in the trade was the best thing to do, to avoid any trouble. In announcing the dismantling of the paedophile network, Britain's National Crime Agency said in mid-January that 11 people had been arrested in the Philippines and 18 elsewhere around the world.  Another 733 suspects were being investigated, the agency added. Andrey Sawchenko, Philippine head of the Washington-based International Justice Mission (IJM) who helped in the arrests, said 39 children had been rescued in Ibabao and elsewhere in the Philippines. But this is widely believed to be just the tip of the iceberg, with the British crime agency describing online child sex abuse as a ""significant and emerging threat"".  ""Extreme poverty, the increasing availability of high speed Internet and the existence of a vast and comparatively wealthy overseas customer base has led to organised crime groups exploiting children for financial gain,"" it said. Dutch advocate group Terre des Hommes estimates that ""tens of thousands"" of children are being abused through the cybersex industry just in the Philippines.  Last year, the group created a virtual 10-year-old Filipina girl that was deployed in Internet chat rooms to lure paedophiles. Over 10 weeks, 20,000 people from 71 countries approached the fake girl asking for sexual performances, according to Terre des Hommes, which passed the details of the paedophiles onto police. "

Lacierda conceded that the problem had been ""under the radar"" but said law-enforcement agencies were now placing greater emphasis on fighting the crime. Authorities are checking tourist establishments to ensure they are not catering to foreign paedophiles, and  parents who push their children into abuse will be prosecuted by the government, he warned. He also said that an anti-cybercrime law -- passed in September 2012 but later blocked by the Supreme Court -- could have helped the Philippines in its efforts to tackle the crime.  The court is still hearing a legal challenge over the law's provisions on online libel and giving the state the power to shut down websites and monitor online activities. Lacierda said the law's provisions were ""a ticklish issue"" but expressed hope that telecommunications companies and officials could reach an agreement over how to proceed.

In some cases, the victims' parents were involved. Fifteen victims aged between six and 15 have been rescued, Britain's National Crime Agency said on Thursday, adding that 29 people had been arrested, including 11 in the Philippines. Three other ongoing investigations have identified 733 suspects, the agency added. Sosa said the Philippines is a ""top 10"" purveyor of what he described as a global ""cottage industry (worth) billions of dollars"". The victims are mostly younger than 18, he said, recounting how he took part in some police raids in the northern city of Angeles, where boys and girls aged between 10 and 14 performed ""lewd acts"" in front of cameras. Some of the suspects arrested are Americans or Europeans, with Filipino ""cohorts"", he said. In Manila, he said the streaming is done inside hotel rooms. It is also done in 31 of the Philippines' 81 provinces, with Angeles, the central city of Cebu and the southern city of Cagayan de Oro being the other main sites. The police official said some of the streaming is done inside shanties in the sprawling slums of the Philippines, a country of 100 million where one in four people live on less than a dollar a day, according to government data. ""The parents themselves facilitate the children's participation,"" Sosa said, adding their earnings help support the families. Video streaming earned them at least $100 an hour, and photo sessions were worth up to 3,000 pesos (about $66), he added. Sosa said most people who pay to view the activity are from the United States and Europe. ""There is no interest in child pornography in our culture. So it is mostly production."" Sosa said the crime had spread through the help of wireless technology where users cannot be effectively tracked by law enforcers. The Philippine passed a law in September 2012 meant to stamp out cybercrimes including fraud, identity theft, spamming, and child pornography. But the Supreme Court blocked the statute before it could take effect amid a legal challenge that it has yet to rule on. Opponents objected to provisions that would authorise heavy prison terms for online libel, and give the state the power to shut down websites and monitor online activities. ""Under that law, telcos (telecommunications firms) are required to retain their data or log files within a period of six months.

A pile of Bitcoins sit in a box ready to be minted by Software engineer Mike Caldwell in his shop on April 26, 2013 in Sandy, Utah. Bitcoin is an experimental digital currency used over the Internet that is gaining in popularity worldwide	 The currency has been linked to a series of high-profile criminal cases in recent months, most notably in the raid on the Silk Road website, dubbed the ""eBay for illegal drugs."" ""Bitcoin is not a magic cloak for illicit transactions,"" Patrick Murck, general counsel for Bitcoin Foundation, which promotes the currency, told the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs. Launched in 2009, bitcoins can be exchanged online for real money or used to buy goods and services on the Internet. The currency is not regulated by any government. Bitcoins recently made headlines when the US Federal Bureau of Investigations closed the Silk Road website where illegal drugs, forged documents, hacker tools and even the services of hitmen were hawked. The FBI seized 26,000 bitcoins worth $3.6 million at the time. Government officials also highlighted another digital currency, the Liberty Reserve (LR), that was created in 2006 and used to launder some $6 billion. Ernie Allen, president of the International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children said that ""child pornography is currently being created and disseminated using technologies and using virtual currencies for payment."" According to Murck, however, if authorities are too unfriendly towards the currency, US-based societies of users will only re-emerge in countries that are more welcoming.  Jeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle Internet Financial, which offers payment services to promote the use of virtual money, denounced ""the widely perceived high cost of transaction fees"" associated with traditional currency. While online currencies compete with standard money, such as the dollar, American Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke wrote to the Senate in September that the currency, while risky, could be promising. Mythili Raman who represented the US Department of Justice, anticipated growth in the money accompanied by growth in illegal transactions. Earlier this year, Germany recognized bitcoin as a currency, which permitted the country to tax bitcoin transactions. Some $1.5 billion in bitcoins is circulating in the world.  Allen, of the International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children, said he believed ""this is an emerging technology that needs to be protected.""

Mr Cameron hailed Google's move as ""significant progress"", even if campaigners noted it affects only a fraction of the 1.2 trillion Google searches conducted each year. Executive chairman Eric Schmidt said more than 200 Google staff have been working on new ways to tackle the problem of child sex abuse images in the past three months. ""While society will never wholly eliminate such depravity, we should do everything in our power to protect children from harm,"" Mr Schmidt wrote in the Daily Mail newspaper. He added: ""We've fine-tuned Google Search to prevent links to child sexual abuse material from appearing in our results."" The restrictions will initially apply to English-speaking countries but will be expanded to the rest of the world and 158 other languages within six months. Microsoft, which owns the Bing search engine, has also stepped up action against online child abuse in recent months and it welcomed Monday's Internet safety summit at Mr Cameron's Downing Street office. ""Increased collaboration (with government and industry bodies)... is the best way to combat this vile content,"" a spokesman for the technology giant said. Microsoft has developed and shared its picture detection technology which helps prevent banned images being duplicated across the web, while Google is also testing new ways to identify videos of child sex abuse. Warnings have been added to more than 13,000 search results making clear child sex abuse is illegal, Mr Schmidt said, while both Google and Microsoft have stopped auto-complete features from offering child abuse search terms. The Internet summit comes just days after police in Canada revealed they had arrested 341 people around the world, including teachers and doctors, following an investigation into a child porn site. Authorities seized a vast amount of data, including hundreds of thousands of images and videos detailing ""horrific"" sexual acts against children as young as five. But the British government has been pushing for action since the summer, after two high-profile child sex murders in which the killers were found to have searched for child porn online. In July, Mr Cameron threatened to introduce legislation to block access to illegal images if search engines failed in their ""moral duty"" to do it voluntarily. ""Since then, we have worked closely with both Google and Microsoft and they have made significant progress in preventing child abuse content from being returned,"" the prime minister said ahead of Monday's summit. But he said the threat of legislation remained.

""If more isn't done to stop illegal content or pathways being found when someone uses a child abuse search term, we will do what is necessary to protect our children."" Some experts warned that the reforms will not stop paedophiles sharing images on the Internet. ""They don't go on to Google to search for images. They go on to the dark corners of the Internet on peer-to-peer websites,"" said Jim Gamble, former head of the police-linked Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre."

											Child labour laws are on the move										",https://search.bangkokpost.com/track/visitAndRedirect?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bangkokpost.com%2Fopinion%2Fopinion%2F374691%2Fchild-labour-laws-are-on-the-move&contentId=news374691,"Migration interfaces with the issue of child labour in many ways. It can be an internal or a cross-border movement. It can be voluntary or forced _ the latter is often linked with the group known as internally displaced persons (not having crossed a frontier) and refugees (crossing or having crossed a frontier in search of  protection). The phrase ""migrant workers"" denotes a cross-border situation. Yet the status of people, including children on the move, varies from documented/regular (coming with the relevant papers/visas) to undocumented/irregular. The precarious situation facing children in employment and migration is particularly acute in the informal sector _ such as in regard to child domestic workers, children in agriculture and in various harmful occupations _ at times on the fringes of the law. To be fair, migration offers opportunities as well as vulnerabilities. It can lead to improved livelihoods and safety (such as a shift from poverty and an escape from a war situation). Yet the migrant may also land in an exploitative situation, such as forced labour and human trafficking. International law responds relatively comprehensively to the situation. The most pertinent treaties are the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, the various International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions on the issue, and the UN convention on the rights of migrant workers and their families. A child is defined as a person under 18 years old. A key principle underlying all these treaties is non-discrimination _ the basic rights of all persons must be protected, irrespective of origins. Of the 189 conventions emerging from the ILO, many interrelate closely with child migrant labour, including Convention No. 138 on minimum age of employment (set at 15, though possibly to be reduced to 14 in developing countries), and Convention No.182 prohibiting the worst forms of child labour, such as the use of children in hazardous activities, with the minimum age of employment set at not less than 18. Meanwhile, the UN convention on migrant workers provides basic guarantees for all migrant workers, irrespective of whether they are documented or not. The rights include the right to life, freedom from torture and cruel treatment, right to free and compulsory education, right of access to medical care in emergency situations and the right of access to justice. However, this convention has received a paucity of ratifications, particularly from countries receiving migrant workers. With regard to forced displacement, there are specific treaties offering protection such as the Refugee Convention of 1951 and its protocol. On the national level, the realities are, however, disquieting. Child migrant labourers often find themselves in a situation of abuse, neglect and exploitation. However, in more enlightened settings, there are now measures to attenuate this situation. For instance, many countries have today adopted new laws/policies/practices (such as on human trafficking) so as to enable these victims to be classified as victims and thus be shifted from immigration detention to welfare shelters, at times with avenues for long-term residency and/or guarantees of a safe return home. For the future, some of the desired orientations for enabling national laws to move towards greater protection and assistance of child migrant labour include the following: Accede to the international conventions above and implement them well to protect the rights of children, as well as promote in-country and cross-country cooperation on the issue, building bridges between the North-South and beyond; Ensure that laws, policies and practices respond to the dynamics of migration interlinking between pre-flow, flow and post-flow situations based on international standards, including minimum age of employment and protection from the worst forms; Couple the existence of laws with adequate policies, mechanisms, practical enforcement, resources, personnel/mechanisms, information, monitoring, education/capacity building, and a participatory process involving communities, civil society and the children themselves in child-related assistance and protection; Implement the message that humane treatment, access to birth registration, free and compulsory education, provision of shelter, health care, social security and access to justice are part of the ""social protection floor"" to be respected and implemented universally _ for all children, without discrimination; Utilise global, regional and national opportunities, such as the post-2015 agenda now awaiting the Millennium Development Goals, to highlight child development, protection and assistance and to advance a comprehensive agenda to help children on the move. Prof Vitit Muntarbhorn is a former UN special rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography and is currently a member of the ILO Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations."

											Historic child abuse inquiry opens in Australia										",https://search.bangkokpost.com/track/visitAndRedirect?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bangkokpost.com%2Fworld%2F369954%2Fhistoric-child-abuse-inquiry-opens-in-australia&contentId=news369954,"  An Australian inquiry into church and institutional child abuse began public hearings Monday, with warnings that widespread and ""shocking"" allegations would be heard against places of worship, orphanages, community groups and schools. People stand with placards outside the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse in Sydney on September 16, 2013.	 Justice Peter McClellan opened the hearings in the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, announced by the government last November, saying that thousands of people had so far come forward. ""It is now well known that the sexual abuse of children has been widespread in the Australian community, however the full range of institutions in which it has occurred is not generally understood,"" McClellan said in an address. ""Many of the stories we are hearing will shock many people."" The inquiry was established by former prime minister Julia Gillard in response to a series of child sex abuse scandals involving paedophile priests, though she insisted the probe would be much broader than the Catholic Church. The commission formally began sitting in April and has since been taking confidential briefings from victims. Monday marks the first public hearings of evidence. McClellan said a hotline set up for survivors of abuse to contact the commission had so far received 4,301 relevant calls. Of these, 398 people had given a private briefing to the commission, 449 were awaiting their session and another 1,178 were yet to be assessed. There were an average of 22 new callers per day -- 10 of which typically went on to give private evidence -- and McClellan said he expected the number to increase as the commission's profile was boosted by public hearings. ""Many people who have come to the commission have suffered greatly, both at the time that the abuse occurred and subsequently through their lives,"" he told the commission hearing in Sydney. ""Many have received counselling at various stages of their lives, many have thought of suicide and some have attempted it. ""Many people including those who suffered abuse 30 or 40 years ago break down in the course of telling their story and require the assistance of support persons to be able to continue."" McClellan said the commission faced a mammoth task and would have to be selective in the matters it took to a public hearing, limiting them to ""systemic issues and policy matters"" or where a ""significant cluster of abused individuals"" was uncovered. Some ""preliminary themes have already emerged"", he said. In residential institutions such as orphanages and boarding schools, for example, he said the commission had established that ""sexual abuse is almost always accompanied by almost unbelievable levels of physical violence inflicted on the children by the adults who have responsibility for their welfare"". The events would often set off a domino effect, with a victim's schoolwork suffering, limiting their future employment prospects, and their ability to trust others and form relationships damaged beyond repair. ""The damage to an individual, be it a boy or girl, who was abused at a time when, because of their age, they are unable to resist an abuser or report the abuse to others, may be life-changing,"" he said, adding that even ""low level"" abuse could have ""catastrophic"" consequences. Monday's hearing, the first of five public sessions to be held before the end of the year, will examine the ""case study"" of convicted paedophile Steven Larkins, who headed an Aboriginal children's charity and was also a Scout leader. Larkins pleaded guilty to indecently assaulting two boys -- aged 11 and 12 -- in separate incidents in 1992 and 1997, and is currently in jail for child pornography offences and forging a declaration of his fitness to work with juveniles."

											Privacy just a thing of the past										",https://search.bangkokpost.com/track/visitAndRedirect?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bangkokpost.com%2Fopinion%2Fopinion%2F369751%2Fprivacy-just-a-thing-of-the-past&contentId=news369751,"It has been a rough couple of months for the folks at the Tor Project. Tor _ it stands for ""The Onion Router"" _ camouflages its users' web communications with encryption and by bouncing signals around server nodes in different parts of the world so that it's all-but impossible for either governments or advertisers to track them to their origins. Its fans hail Tor as a vital tool for those who live under repressive governments. But Tor has suffered a series of public embarrassments _ embarrassments that teach important lessons about the increasingly desperate search for online privacy. Last month, we learned that the anonymity protocols that are Tor's reason for existence had been hacked, apparently by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation, which was investigating an alleged purveyor of child pornography. Then, last week, we were reminded that some 60% of the budget of the Tor Project comes from the federal government, including a whopping 40% from the Department of Defence. (Tor responded in an email published in The Washington Post that these are research grants, and the US does not control its research or software.) Now, most unkindly of all, Technology Review is piling on. This week, the popular technology magazine and website reported a study by the same researchers at the University of Luxembourg who earlier in the year found a major security flaw at Tor. (They informed Tor of the problem, and it has been repaired.) In their new study, the researchers have unpeeled a few layers of Tor's celebrated onion of anonymity, releasing a tabulation of the most popular among Tor's ""hidden services"" _ that is, sites that can be accessed only via Tor itself. The news wasn't good. For a site whose glory has long been the image of the courageous freedom fighter in, say, Syria bravely sending messages to the world, the results were depressing: ""Of the top 20 most popular Tor addresses, 11 are command and control centres for botnets, including all of the top five. Of the rest, five carry adult content, one is for Bitcoin mining and one is the Silk Road marketplace. Two could not be classified."" Bitcoin is an electronic cash system, while Silk Road is an online black market. It gets even worse: ""The FreedomHosting address is only the 27th most popular address,"" according to Technology Review. In other words, the anonymity of Tor appeals principally to botnets, commonly used by spammers; those who peddle or seek pornography; and those who use a marketplace that has been called ""the Amazon.com for illegal drugs"". As for Freedom Hosting: It was, for a while, one of the glories of the Tor universe. Although not sponsored by Tor, Freedom Hosting promised free accounts to anyone. But in August, its founder was arrested, charged by the US government with being the world's biggest purveyor of child pornography. He was also said to have turned a blind eye to other people's use of Freedom Hosting for that purpose. So what are the lessons of Tor's long summer? Principally this: We are unlikely ever to be able to ensure our privacy through technical means alone. Ever since the days of the Polybius square, the race between encryption and decryption has been won by the decrypters. Just this week, we learned that the National Security Agency may have developed either decryption capabilities or secret backdoors that enabled it to break most internet encryption. (The problem may be even worse if, as some experts speculate, the NSA is developing dedicated chips that will aid in cracking even the elliptical keys that not long ago were said to carry the promise of a more secure online future.) Nor can we protect privacy online through laws and court orders. The NSA, we are now told by a federal judge, for three years ""frequently and systematically"" breached the limits placed on database searches by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. The database in question includes ""the phone records of nearly all Americans"". Privacy is best understood not so much as a collection of discrete constitutional rights but as a shared sense that it is possible for us to go about our daily business protected by a government that neither knows nor cares how we spend the bulk of our time. The minutes of our lives are entirely our own. But in a world ruled by the web, privacy in this traditional sense seems so 1990s. ""There's nothing you or I can do to put the genie back in the bottle,"" writes security analyst Neil J Rubenking. (The title of his post: ""Privacy is dead. The NSA killed it. Now what?"") ""The best we can hope for,"" he writes, ""is to keep the government in check by electing sane, sensible candidates."" That won't be enough. The government's appetite for information isn't going to wane under either party. A voracious security bureaucracy isn't going to go on a sudden diet. The bad guys will always be drawn to the shadows. Those who chase them will always find this an adequate reason to ban darkness. So yes, as Tor users have lately learned, privacy in the traditional sense is most certainly dead. But the killer isn't the NSA. It's the internet itself _ or, more to the point, our entire reliance on it, our naive belief that we can spend hours each day sending signals into the ether and nobody will pluck them out. If we don't want anyone to know what we're buying, we'll have to visit brick-and-mortar stores and pay with cash. If we don't want those who are sworn to protect us reading our emails and listening to our calls, we'll have to meet our friends in person. It's our growing unwillingness to take those time-consuming steps that's killing our privacy. Stephen L. Carter is a Bloomberg View columnist and a professor of law at Yale University.

The Operation Predator app from the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) branch of the Department of Homeland Security appears on an iPhone in Washington, DC on September 12, 2013.	 The ""Operation Predator"" app lets informants submit information via email or a telephone tip line, and also includes a run-down of the nation's most-wanted alleged child sex offenders. It is free to download via iTunes, albeit with a warning that it is not for persons under the age of 17, presumably the group most vulnerable to child sex crimes. ""When children are being sexually abused and exploited, it's a race against the clock to rescue the child and bring the predator to justice,"" said John Sandweg, acting director of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the Homeland Security unit behind the app. ""These investigations are one of our highest priorities and, in today's world, we need to be technologically savvy and innovative in our approach,"" he said.

ICE said the unidentified man appears in glasses and a beard in video files seen by ICE agents in Los Angeles earlier this year sexually abusing a girl aged between 10 and 12 in a wood-panelled room. Other suspects -- all wanted for making, distributing or owning child pornography -- include a 35-year-old Indian national who allegedly helped run an Internet bulletin board for child-porn purveyors.

A pile of Bitcoin slugs sit in a box on April 26, 2013 in Sandy, Utah. A New York regulator Monday announced a probe into virtual currencies like Bitcoin, saying they could be used by drug traffickers and gun runners and threaten US national security. As part of the probe, according to a person familiar with the matter, the New York Department of Financial Services has sent subpoenas seeking information assistance from 22 companies investing or trading in Bitcoins, an online currency not tied to any one country or regulator that exploded in popularity earlier this year. The subpoenas included major venture capital groups as well as money exchange and transfer firms that have adopted the virtual currency. Benjamin Lawsky, state superintendent of financial services, said in the announcement Monday that while the state had an interest in supporting innovation in the financial sector, it had to ""ensure that consumers and our national security remain protected."" ""We have also seen instances where the cloak of anonymity provided by virtual currencies has helped support dangerous criminal activity, such as drug smuggling, money laundering, gun running, and child pornography."" ""If virtual currencies remain a virtual Wild West for narcotraffickers and other criminals, that would not only threaten our country's national security, but also the very existence of the virtual currency industry as a legitimate business enterprise."" Lawsky said the aim is to ""bring virtual currencies out of the darkness and into the light of day"" to protect the public.. He said that preliminary inquiries suggest that virtual currency exchangers may be engaging in ""money transmission,"" an activity licensed and regulated by the department. But, as it reviews the various issues surrounding them, the department will weigh whether to issue specific regulatory guidelines on virtual currencies. One goal would be to make sure that consumers are correctly serviced in their virtual currency trades and redemptions, he said. Secondly, the department will aim at rooting out illegal activity from the industry -- preventing it from ""serving as a money changer of choice for terrorists, drug smugglers, illegal weapons dealers,"" and others. He also stressed that the review would help protect venture capital firms as they show rising interest in the sector. According to a source familiar with the matter, subpoena recipients included Google Ventures; the Andreessen Horowitz venture capital fund; Founders Fund launched by PayPal cofounder Peter Thiel; and Winklevoss Capital Management led by the Winklevoss twins, famous for their feud with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg.

Abbott has pledged to spend one week every year in a remote indigenous community if elected, saying he wanted to be the ""prime minister for Aboriginal affairs"".	 Abbott said he wanted to make Australia's most disadvantaged minority his top priority were he to win national elections on September 7, unveiling a new policy to promote private ownership of some communal Aboriginal land. ""It is all very well having the right to live on your land, having the right to walk over your land, having the right if necessary to exclude people from your land,"" Abbott told a community meeting in Nhulunbuy, part of central Australia's Arnhem Land. ""But land has to be an economic asset as well as a spiritual asset, and I will do whatever I humanly can in government to bring this about."" Abbott said he wanted to be the ""prime minister for Aboriginal affairs"" and described the gulf between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians as a ""lack of engagement"". He pledged to spend one week of every year living in a remote community, starting with Nhulunbuy, and said he would bring responsibility for Aboriginal issues into the prime minister's department, also appointing a former heavyweight from the rival Labor party, Warren Mundine, to spearhead his efforts. As well as private ownership of land Mundine flagged an end to the system of permits issued by Aboriginal custodians governing access to cultural lands in order to attract development and jobs under an Abbott administration. Of his annual plan to stay in an Aboriginal settlement, Abbott said: ""I know there will be people who say you can't do that, you're goofing off, you're not doing your job. ""The fact is if these places are home to the first Australians why shouldn't they be home to the prime minister of our country?"" Abbott also pledged a referendum on recognising Aborigines in the constitution within his first year in office -- a policy proposed by Labor but shelved earlier this year due to lack of community engagement. In an interview with The Australian newspaper ahead of his policy announcement Abbott likened some impoverished Aboriginal communities to ""Somalia without guns"". Abbott's conservatives launched a controversial military-led intervention to tackle pornography, alcohol and child abuse in central Australia's remote Aboriginal communities when they were last in office, and resisted a national apology to the nation's original inhabitants for wrongs committed since British settlement in 1788. Several conservative lawmakers walked out of parliament when Prime Minister Kevin Rudd went on to deliver such an apology -- an historic moment in race relations in Australia -- upon taking office in 2008. Aborigines, the most disadvantaged Australians, are believed to have numbered around one million at the time of British settlement. There are now just 470,000 out of a total population of 23 million, and they suffer disproportionate levels of disease, imprisonment and social problems as well as significantly lower education, employment and life expectancy. Rudd welcomed Abbott's appointment of Mundine, who he described as a personal friend, and said tackling indigenous issues ought to be above politics. ""We are judged by the rest of the world on these questions and rightly so, and we will be judged by our children as to whether we have got this right,"" he said. At the time of the 2008 apology Labor launched national ""Closing the Gap"" targets on health, education, mortality and imprisonment, with progress reported annually to parliament. Moderate improvement has been seen on some measures."

Russian legislation aimed at battling pirated video content online went into effect Thursday despite complaints by the industry against the alleged crackdown on free Internet. Branded the ""Russian SOPA"" after the US anti-piracy initiative, the law makes it easier to block websites that post or link to copyright video content without permission. Copyright holders would have to provide documents to the Moscow City Court for a court order before contacting Russia's communications watchdog Roskomnadzor to block the offender. Companies in the industry have lambasted the law, saying the measure makes it possible for anyone to block any website with ease and was put together without taking any suggestions from experts into account. Roskomnadzor announced the launch of the new register online where copyright holders can file complaints against violating webpages. The register's website (nap.rkn.gov.ru) would not open Thursday morning, possibly due to an overload or an attack. Google has called the law a ""time bomb"" for the Internet, and Yandex, the most popular search engine in Russia, said it ""is directed against the logic of the Internet,"" not copyright violators. ""The new law makes it possible to shut down unwanted Internet resources by linking any piracy video to the website and submitting a lawsuit"", and the ""lack of clear wording"" leaves ample room for abuse, VTB Capital said in a note to clients Thursday. Russian television on Thursday hailed the new law as a measure to fight piracy. ""Bad luck for lovers of freebies,"" Channel One called it on its newscast. Popular webpages in Russia have launched a formal petition on a government website to push the authorities to reconsider the so-called ""Russian SOPA,"" which gathered over 60,000 signatures by Thursday. ""Vote and share, otherwise tomorrow you will be able to open VKontakte only with the written sanction of a policeman,"" wrote anti-Kremlin protest leader Alexei Navalny, referring to Russia's most popular social network. Marginalised by state television, Navalny has built up much of his popularity through the web. He called on all Internet users to ""start a political campaign to defend our right to information and access to the web without censorship."" The website popular with tech professionals Habrahabr.ru called on popular web pages to block themselves in an Internet strike for one day Thursday. Popular website Lurkmore.to had a black screen up saying ""Blocked by Roskomnadzor decision"" in a protest. Russia has been phasing in a number of measures that observers say aim to severely limit freedom of expression on the web. The Russian parliament plans to expand the piracy law to include music later this year. A new measure banning the media from using expletives also went into effect in April. In July the online publication Lenta.Ru said that authorities demanded blocking three articles, including an interview with a language professor about the origins of Russian obscene words. Last year another law went into force that allows the blocking of websites with content that contain child pornography, calls to commit suicide or information on drug use. That law was also criticised by the industry as containing wording that can be exploited. In November, the authorities briefly put the entire YouTube service onto the blacklist due to what they later said was a ""technical mistake."""

The Electronic Transactions Development Agency is joining forces with online service providers to stem the spread of illegal content on the web. (Photo by Pattarapong Chatpattarasill) The move is the country's first attempt to create a transparent code of conduct for stemming illegal content on the web, said ETDA director Surangkana Wayuparb. The ETDA on Wednesday signed a memorandum of understanding with the PKI Association, Thailand Information Security Association, Internet Foundation for the Development of Thailand, Thailand ISP Association, Thai e-Commerce Association, Google Asia Pacific and eBay Inc. Mrs Surangkana said the organisations would form a self-regulated online community, which will create and promote clear procedures on how to deal with illegal online content, particularly related to pornography, terrorism and drugs, as well as deception, spam and phishing, and intellectual property rights. She said there had been no common agreement or standards to deal with such content in the past, or to help providers categorise exactly what is and is not legal. “We are working to settle the details of the code of conduct within one year,” Mrs Surangkana said. She added that providers would have a responsibility to remove illegal content within 15 days after the code of conduct is implemented. Currently, providers are not required to remove illegal content from websites within a designated time limit. In the broadcasting and radio sectors, Mrs Surangkana said industry-regulation is already successful. But the online community has yet to follow suit. Anan Kaewruamwong, chairman of the Thailand ISP Association, said the collaboration represents up to 90% of local content providers in the country. In the past four years, at least 50,000 Thai URLs or web addresses, were required to remove illegal content, mostly relating to pornography or content that posed a risk to national security. Srida Tanta-atipanid, manager of Internet Foundation for the Development of Thailand, said the foundation had received around 300 requests from overseas organisations asking it to remove child pornography hosted on Thai websites over the past three years."

Immigration and Customs Enforcement director John Morton said Operation iGuardian targeted online sexual abusers as well as perpetrators who possess, produce or trade child pornography. In a statement, he said the five-week operation rescued 61 child victims. Most of those arrested were from the United States, with additional arrests in Thailand, Brazil, Canada, Israel, Mexico, the Phillipines, Singapore and South Korea. Mr Morton said 17 of those arrested held positions of trust, including nine teachers and three clergy members. ""Protecting our youth in the digital age requires all of us to be on the lookout for child predators abusing and extorting victims online,"" Morton said. ""Children and parents need to understand that not everyone online is who they say they are."" Mr Morton said the investigation reflected the growth of child ""sextortion"", in which predators groom minors to send them graphic images and then blackmail them into performing sex or sending more explicit photos. ""Child abusers prowl social media looking for opportunities to force young people into sexual exploitation through guile, deceit and extortion,"" he said. ""We want children to know that it's wrong for any adult to solicit or pressure them for sex and that the law is on their side."""

Pope Francis leads a mass during a visit to the Italian island of Lampedusa, on July 8, 2013. Pope Francis has bolstered criminal legislation against child abuse in the Vatican in an overhaul of laws that apply to the clergymen and lay people who work in the tiny city state.	 The Vatican said in a statement that the pope's decree included ""a broader definition of the category of crimes against minors"" including child prostitution, sexual acts with children and child pornography. The new laws are part of an introduction of forms of crime indicated in international conventions that the Vatican has already ratified including against racism and war crimes and on children's rights. ""While many of the specific criminal offences included in these laws are undeniably new, it would however be incorrect to assume that the forms of conduct thereby sanctioned were previously licit,"" said Monsignor Dominique Mamberti, who is in charge of relations between the Holy See and other states. ""These were indeed punished, but as broader, more generic forms of criminal activity,"" it added. Francis also increased cooperation with other states against money laundering and terrorism in a continuation of reforms begun by his predecessor, Benedict XVI, to get the Vatican in line with international legislation. The new norms also introduce the administrative responsibility of Vatican departments -- a potentially radical change that would complement his plans to root out corruption from the scandal-ridden Vatican bureaucracy. The pope's reform ""extends the reach of the legislation contained in these criminal laws to the members, officials and employees of the various bodies of the Roman Curia,"" the central body of the Catholic Church, Mamberti said. ""This extension has the aim of making the crimes included in these laws indictable by the judicial organs of Vatican City State even when committed outside the borders of the state,"" he said. The laws will come into force on September 1. The Vatican explained some of the provisions in its criminal code were ""rather dated"". Among the novelties is that life imprisonment will be outlawed and replaced with a maximum sentence of 35 years. There was also a direct consequence of the ""Vatileaks"" scandal last year when Benedict's butler Paolo Gabriele published confidential documents from Vatican offices alleging widespread corruption and mismanagement. Punishment will be increased for anyone stealing secret papers."

A message, claimed to be written by Bangkok Aviation Centre founder and CEO Piya Tregalnon, revealing the jet-setting monk's unusual wealth has been shared widely on social networks. Caught on film: The monk with a wad of US $100 bills (each worth about 3,000 baht), one of the acts that led Wg Cdr Piya Tregalnon to post photos and condemnation of Luang Pu Nen Kham Chattiko on his Facebook page. Wing Commander Piya Sunday confirmed he posted the message on his Facebook page. ""I have been wondering for three years why the monk has such large amounts of money and assets. He is not even a very famous monk,"" he said. ""When he came into the spotlight, I decide to speak out as I think his wealth is suspicious."" The Facebook post dates back three years ago, when Wg Cdr Piya was asked to find a seven-seat private jet for the monk to travel back and forth between Bangkok and Ubon Ratchathani. The monk always paid in cash — about 300,000 baht for each rental, Wg Cdr Piya said. The monk also showed interest in buying his own private jet, which can cost 500-700 million baht for a new plane and at least 100 million baht for a second-hand craft. The monk often travelled in a super luxury Maybach-brand car and boasted that he had a Mercedes-Benz S500, a BMW X6 and a Mini Cooper just for driving inside the temple compound. He also claimed to have a yacht, Wg Cdr Piya said. The monk also showed bundles of US$100 (3,129 baht) banknotes fully packed in his kitbag and claimed he also had gold bars inside, he said. He showed two chequebooks of US banks with his name printed on every cheque. The monk said he could withdraw more than $10 million for each cheque because he had a lot of money deposited in the banks, Wg Cdr Piya said. He said he distanced himself from Luang Pu Nen Kham after the monk asked him to buy a private jet in the US. The monk also used to ask the pilot to carry his kitbag when he passed immigration checkpoints. ""I am not afraid of being charged at all after revealing this issue. I wrote what I had seen with my own eyes. I do not want to see a person who exploited Buddhists' faith to obtain money to remain at large,"" the pilot said. Meanwhile, a former close aide of Phra Wirapol told the Department of Special Investigation Sunday the monk had drunk alcohol, taken illicit drugs and had sex with many teenage girls. Pol Lt Col Pong-in Intarakhao, chief of the agency's Security Crime Bureau, Sunday led a team of DSI investigators to interrogate witnesses in Si Sa Ket province. One of the witnesses, who was a former close aide of the monk, told the DSI the monk had brought his luxury cars to be repaired at his garage in Ubon Ratchathani. The monk also used the garage as a venue for drinking alcohol, viewing porn videos, taking drugs, and having sexual affairs with many young women, Pol Lt Col Pong-in said after interrogating the 56-year-old witness for about one hour. The monk is under investigation by the DSI for allegedly having intimate relationships with several women, with one of them claiming he had fathered her child. The Crime Suppression Division (CSD) will ask the Office of the Narcotics Control Board (ONCB) to investigate the sources of money and assets belonging to the monk. The division will tomorrow share information regarding the monk's finances with the ONCB secretary-general, deputy CSD chief Prasopchok Prommul said. Pol Col Prasopchok Sunday led a team of CSD police to search the house of the monk's parents in Ubon Ratchathani's Phibun Mangsahan district. However, Rath Sukphol and his wife Sudjai, the monk's parents, did not allow the search. A source said the house was worth about 100 million baht. The CSD team later went to search the monk's Santitham Baramee monastery, covering 28 rai in the same district. but could not enter as the gate was locked.

A student displays a picture of King Bhumibol Adulyadej on a tablet at the Ban San Kong school. In a rural classroom in the Thai highlands, hill tribe children energetically slide their fingertips over tablet computer screens practicing everything from English to mathematics and music.	 The disadvantaged students are part of an ambitious scheme by the kingdom to distribute millions of the handheld devices in its schools in a move supporters hope will boost national education standards. For opponents of the plan, however, it is an expensive gimmick designed to boost the popularity of the ruling party among parents -- and the next generation of voters. At Ban San Kong school in Mae Chan in the northern province of Chiang Rai, 90 children received a tablet computer last year as part of the ""One Tablet Per Child"" policy that was part of the government's election campaign in 2011. Previously the school had only a few desktop computers with limited Internet access. Now, with headphones over their ears for one hour a day during class, the students use the devices for activities including singing English songs, watching cartoons about the life of Thailand's revered King Bhumibol and playing math games. With the school year just beginning, and the new tablet content yet to arrive, they are left to revise their lessons of the previous year as their teacher Siriporn Wichaipanid sits and watches. She has received no specific training for using the tablets and seems at a bit of a loss. ""I have some knowledge. At home, I use an iPad,"" she said. But ""if I don't understand, I don't know how to teach the children"". For the students -- mostly from ethnic minority Akha hill tribe communities for whom Thai is not their mother tongue -- using the tablets has been a positive experience, according to the school. ""The students cannot speak Thai very well but they can hear sounds more clearly from the tablets and repeat them,"" said their teacher from the previous year, Wannawadee Somdang. ""Some of them dare not ask questions. It's easier when they listen to the tablets."" For now only two of the 90 students are allowed to take the computers with them after class to use in their homes, which often lack electricity. ""They don't have Wi-Fi and it's not convenient for them to charge the batteries. And most importantly their parents have no knowledge about the tablets,"" said school principal Uthai Moonmueangkham. But using devices that would normally be out of reach for the kingdom's poorest children is progress, even if it is only just one hour a day, he said. ""They have the same opportunities as those in the city,"" Uthai said. Reducing the ""education gap"" between the urban rich and rural poor is one aim of the project, said Surapol Navamavadhand, an advisor to the minister of information and communication technology. By the end of 2014, the government plans to distribute handheld computers to 13 million school children at a cost of about $100 each -- a total of $1.3 billion -- and then replace them every two years. About 850,000 Chinese-made devices have already been given out, and the government says it will soon launch a tender offer for another batch of about 1.7 million tablets, in what it has described as the world's largest handout of the devices for education. Experts warn that the computers offer no guarantee of an increase in education standards. The tablets are ""just another tool"" like a pencil, according to Jonghwi Park, an education technology specialist at UNESCO in Bangkok. ""It's not about what to use, it's about how to use it,"" she said, urging governments considering introducing new technology for learning to think hard about whether it will really help them achieve their goals. Critics of the Thai education system say much more radical changes are needed. ""If you want to deal with the education in Thailand, I can tell you that the whole system must be demolished,"" said Somphong Chitradub, an associate professor specialised in child education at Bangkok's Chulalongkorn University. ""Our classrooms are passive, tiring and boring,"" he said. Most Thai children are encouraged to memorise information and ""lack courage to express opinions"", he added. As a result, while other Asian nations fared well in the most recent global education survey by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in 2009, Thailand came about 50th out of 65 countries in the rankings for reading, maths and science. A mediocre performance compared with other nations that ""focus a lot on process of thinking"", admitted Rangsan Maneelek, an advisor to the education ministry. While the Thai education system places importance on whether the answer is right or wrong, other nations look at how students reached their conclusion, he said. But he added that the tablets would help by enabling students to ""surf the world for knowledge"". And if some people worry about the possibility of children using the computers to look at pornography or play violent video games, others stress the need to prepare students for the digital era. ""For the kids these days, one of the most important capacities... for them to live in the 21st century is to know how to integrate those devices into their life,"" UNESCO's Park said. ""Without those skills, they cannot get a job."""

File picture shows couples kissing on Valentine's Day in Paris. Where are people most unfaithful? Who uses sex toys? On a darker level, where is child rape more prevalent? French geographers have tried to answer these questions and others in a global atlas on sexuality From legislation and the dynamics of couples to prostitution and violence, the book maps out the evolution of sexual habits and acts around the world by collating various surveys, figures and reports already available. ""Sexuality is everywhere on our city walls and on our screens, in lighter news or in darker events,"" said Nadine Cattan, research director in geography at France's National Center for Scientific Research. ""We wanted to cover all this worldwide to try and understand it a bit better,"" she said, adding the research had lasted 18 months. The atlas covers multiple areas, such as what it calls a ""sexual and amorous transition"" happening in Europe, where infidelity is on the rise. Using data drawn across five European countries from the 1.5 million members of Gleeden -- a dating site for married people who want affairs -- the atlas pinpoints Paris as the city where most people are unfaithful. According to the data, more than half of those who cheat on their partners are highly educated, and 22 percent work in finance, banking or insurance. The major reason cited for infidelity is a desire to test their seduction power. In its chapter on couples, the atlas also explores other sexual habits, such as the frequency of sexual intercourse or the level of satisfaction. In Greece, Poland and Brazil, some 80 percent of the population think sex is very important, while in Thailand and Japan just 38 percent do, it says. In Europe, people in Britain, Norway and Sweden are the most avid users of sex toys, citing a report by condom maker Durex, while southern countries including France are not that interested. On the much darker side of the matter, the atlas collates figures on prostitution, sexual violence and discrimination. Sweden held a European record for the number of registered rape complaints in 2008 -- or 53.2 out of 100,000 inhabitants -- although the atlas points out the country's legal definition of rape is much broader than in other nations. It adds that many countries have taken measures to address sexual harassment, such as women-only bus lines in Mexico and similar initiatives in cities in Brazil, Egypt and Japan. But in Europe, only 14 percent of rape complaints lead to a conviction, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime says. And on that same continent, Northern Ireland held the unenviable record in 2008 of complaints of sexual assaults on minors, according to the same organisation. Prostitution and pornography are also widely covered. According to the data, 98 percent of porn is made in the United States and the remaining two percent in other nations, mainly Russia, Hungary and the Czech Republic. The sex trade, meanwhile, has exacted a heavy toll on biodiversity due to those who take aphrodisiacs to improve their performance -- Vietnam, China and South Korea being in the lead. Rhinoceroses have been particularly hard hit due to the belief that their horns are hugely powerful aphrodisiacs, with the animal decimated in Africa. Such is the demand that thieves have stolen rhino horns in dozens of museums, zoos or other institutions across Europe and South Africa, as detailed in maps."

The United States on Tuesday unveiled what it called the world's ""largest"" money laundering probe against the digital currency operator Liberty Reserve.	 The Costa Rica-based entity, which handled huge amounts of money outside the control of national governments, is charged with running a ""$6 billion money laundering scheme and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business,"" the US Attorney's office for New York said. Prosecutors said Liberty Reserve processed at least 55 million illegal transactions for at least one million users ""and facilitated global criminal conduct."" The probe involved law enforcement in 17 countries and ""is believed to be the largest money laundering prosecution in history,"" the prosecutor's office said. Liberty Reserve's principals were arrested Friday in a round-up launched simultaneously in Costa Rica, Spain and New York, sealing the fate of a company that had been one of the most successful in the popular but increasingly scrutinized world of unofficial banking and virtual currencies. One of them, Russian citizen Maxim Chukharev, is set to be extradited to the United States, Costa Rican authorities said Tuesday. The indictment accuses Liberty Reserve founder Arthur Budovsky -- a former US citizen who took Costa Rican nationality -- and his partners of creating a firm that masqueraded as a convenient and legitimate money transfer system. In reality, the organization turned itself into the ""financial hub of the cyber-crime world,"" the indictment said. US Attorney Preet Bharara said ""the only liberty that Liberty Reserve gave many of its users was the freedom to commit crime."" Customers would go to Liberty Reserve's now shut-down website to buy the online currency, known as LRs, that could then be used in transactions with other LR users. The system was not registered with US authorities and unlike some other non-state currency systems did not require proof of identity for users. Adding another important layer of anonymity, Liberty required customers to buy or sell their LRs via third party exchangers, meaning that there was no direct link between a customer's traditional bank account and Liberty's system. An extra service would allow a user to hide ""his own Liberty Reserve account number when transferring funds, effectively making the transfer completely untraceable, even within Liberty Reserve's already opaque system."" The system, the indictment says, was tailor-made for criminal transactions and money-laundering, facilitating ""a broad range of online criminal activity, including credit card fraud, identity theft, investment fraud, computer hacking, child pornography, and narcotics trafficking."" ""The scope of the defendants' unlawful conduct is staggering,"" the indictment said. ""With more than 200,000 users in the United States, Liberty Reserve processed more than 12 million financial transactions annually, with a combined value of more than $1.4 billion."" Authorities say that when Liberty Reserve realized it was under investigation it made a show of shutting down, yet continued to operate behind an array of shell companies in Australia, China, Cyprus, Hong Kong, Morocco, Russia and Spain. Budovsky and his partners started Liberty Reserve after an earlier similar venture, Gold Age Inc, which traded the E-Gold digital currency, was shut down by US authorities. It was then that Budovsky, 39, emigrated to Costa Rica, later renouncing his US citizenship, and becoming resident in The Netherlands. He was arrested in Spain. He and his four partners, who range in age from 27 to 46, face maximum prison terms of 20 years if found guilty of conspiracy to commit money laundering, as well as up to 10 years on charges related to running an unlicensed money transmitting business. Chukarev was described as being co-responsible for Liberty Reserve's technical infrastructure. Virtual currencies have grown exponentially, but face pressure on numerous fronts. The popular Bitcoin system has come under scrutiny by financial authorities and seen growing trading volatility. Acting Assistant Attorney General Mythili Raman said the United States had used ""every tool we have"" to combat ""global illicit finances."" As Bharara put it, ""the global enforcement action we announce today is an important step towards reining in the 'Wild West' of illicit Internet banking."" ""As crime goes increasingly global, the long arm of the law has to get even longer, and in this case, it encircled the earth,"" he added."

Agencies are now attempting to propose amendments to the law to make it correspond more accurately to modern Thai society and global standards. The Computer Crime Act involves several social and financial issues, from e-transactions to the thorny topic of lese majeste offences allegedly committed online, which have become one of the most debated social and legal concerns. The Electronic Transactions Development Agency (ETDA) has been assigned by Information, Communication and Technology Minister Gp Capt Anudith Nakornthap to study and analyse the problems and consider possible amendments to the present law. Using research, focus groups and working groups to gather ideas, the ETDA expects to submit a draft amendment to the Council of State by the end of this year before progressing to cabinet by the end of next year. It's expected that any changes to the law will become effective over the next three years. The existing law has greatly impacted internet users and service providers, and some sections of the law have become linked with continuing political and social conflicts. Most observers believe that the mechanism of the law is not flexible enough or sufficiently well-defined. The proposed amendments will try to reset the methodology in order to improve the law's ability to deal with critical issues. Besides studying regulations of the related laws of Thailand and foreign countries and the concerns over the current law, there is also a working group comprising experts and representatives of the organisations involved. Several alterations will be proposed, and the draft will add points to cover areas including spam mail, identity theft, security offences and child pornography. According to Pol Col Siripong Timula, deputy commander of the Technology Crime Suppression Division, 90% of internet servers used in Thailand are hosted abroad, including those of YouTube and Facebook. Naturally, the jurisdiction of Thai law doesn't extend outside the country. Many countries, such as the US, have no equivalent offence to lese majeste, although the Criminal Mutual Cooperation Act can be applied. ""What we can do today is just block the site within Thailand's territory, however it has been widely criticised that this means the limitation of freedom of users,"" said Siripong, who added that most of the cases currently dealt with under the Computer Crime Act are about lese majeste, defamation and computer fraud. Mark Charoenwong, a public prosecutor attached to the Office of the Attorney-General, noted that the Section 26 of the law states that service providers must keep log files for at least 90 days and must be able to authenticate them in order to define users. He said problems ensue from this. He believes that the section should be adjusted to state exactly what kind of information should be kept in the log file, how long it should be kept, and who is responsible for it. Most importantly, the law must try to balance national security with a guarantee of freedom of speech for individuals. Google Thailand public policy and government affairs manager Phichet Rerkpreecha suggested the draft should include a ""notice and takedown"" measure. This is more or less a flagging system _ a process operated by online hosts in response to court orders or allegations that content is illegal. Potentially illegal content can be removed by the host after receiving an official notice. ""Under the present law, the regulator solely enforces the rule. But a 'notice and takedown' is a collaboration between the private sector and the government. It comprises three parties: government, platform service providers and users,"" says Phichet, adding that abroad, such notices are widely used in cases of copyright infringement, as well as for libellous content. It is a significant mechanism that has been adopted by, among others, the US, UK, countries in Europe, and, in Southeast Asia, Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia. ETDA director Surangkana Wayuparb noted that Thai people lack security awareness, an issue many governments consider critically important. The agency has established focus groups to specifically cover the areas of freedom of speech, law enforcement, consumers and victims, and information security. ""We are also working on a report about the threat status of Thailand and other countries which is expected to stimulate public awareness on cyber security and the law adjustment, especially the issue of hacking,"" said Surangkana. The newly set up National Cyber Security Committee, chaired by Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, will also enhance the strength of information security against such threats as hacking. According to the Thai Computer Emergency Response Team (ThaiCERT), the primary cyber threats in Thailand last year were fraud (69.3%), intrusion attempts (10.3%), information gathering (7.9%) and malicious code (7.4%)."

Be it pro-military or anti-anything from Muslims to the media, to Aung San Suu Kyi, the nation's Facebook pages and blogs are full of it. While we can never know exactly who is responsible for creating these platforms, their content can provide clues to the identity of their authors. Many regularly feature the national flag, while others favour images of the warrior king statues that stand at the entrance to the Defence Services Academy in Pyin Oo Lwin. Despite the secrecy, Buddhist monk Ashin Issariya, who was arrested for his role in the 2007 ''Saffron Revolution'', said he is convinced that many of the sites are the work of the military.

It's ''suspicious'', he said, ''just how quickly some groups are able to upload and distribute information'', especially those that seek to incite violence. ''Many of the sites feature the national flag and photos from Nay Pyi Taw, and most of their news comes from government websites,'' he said. Despite his suspicions, it remains ''really difficult'' to prove who exactly is behind the sites, Nay Phone Latt said. ''The groups use two kinds of platforms,'' he said. ''The first is for the publication of propaganda messages, such as encouraging violence between ethnic or religious groups, while the second is for communicating with their supporters.'' In an informal study of 10 websites by anonymous authors, Spectrum found that they all contained items that were pro-military, anti-Muslim and anti-opposition, with Mrs Suu Kyi, Min Ko Naing, the 88 Generation Students Group and other prominent activists among those specifically targeted. To attract readers, the sites often use pornography, malicious gossip and salacious rumours, including one suggesting that Mrs Suu Kyi had a child while she was under house arrest. One of the country's most popular websites is Myanmarexpress.net, which was set up in 2011, about the same time Mrs Suu Kyi was given her freedom. The site is registered in Moscow and since its creation has generated more than 22 million page views. Adding weight to the suggestion that the military is behind these sites is the high number of army personnel that are given advanced training in information technology. In their 2011 paper ''Russia, Myanmar and Nuclear Technologies'', prepared for the Nuclear Club journal, authors Anton Khlopkov and Dmitry Konukhov said that since 2001, Myanmar's Ministry of Science and Technology has sent about 500 students a year to Russian universities. In the 2010-11 academic year, Myanmar sent more students to Russian universities than any other country in the world. As well as being graduates of Myanmar's leading technology institutes, the vast majority of the students sent to Russia each year are military officers, predominantly lieutenants and captains, the report said. Sai Thein Win is a former major in the Myanmar army who fled the country in 2010 after revealing details of the government's suspected nuclear weapons programme. Now living in Norway, he told Spectrum that his email account was hacked in 2011 and that his personal data was posted on Myanmarexpress.net. Using his IT skills Sai Thein Win was able to track down the hacker, who he discovered was also a military man. ''The hacker was an army officer who had studied in Russia. I could also tell from the IP address that he was based in Myanmar,'' he said. Sai Thein Win said it was also clear that blogs like Myanmar Express and Opposite Eyes have links to official organisations. ''Lots of these sites have access to photographs and information that simply would not be available to anyone outside the police or military,'' he said. ''The blogs are set up to turn public opinion against people like Aung San Suu Kyi and organisations such as the 88 Generation Students Group,'' he said. ''They also try to stir up religious conflict, like what happened in Rakhine and Meiktila.'' INCITING VIOLENCE In 2012, an Arakanese woman was raped and murdered, allegedly by Muslim men, in the village of Kyauk Ni Maw, a remote community in the west of Myanmar. Long before the incident was officially reported by the government, countless ''unofficial'' websites and blogs broke the story. Several of them even ran a photo of the victim, though none provided a source for the image. Where it came from, nobody can say for sure. What is known for certain is that less than a week after the reports were published, 10 Muslim clergymen were slaughtered in the town of Taungup, Rakhine state, by an angry mob hell-bent on revenge. The incident sparked further rioting by both Muslims and Buddhists throughout Rakhine. Since the conflicts in Rakhine began, about 200 people have been killed, countless numbers have been injured and more than 70,000 have been left homeless. The clashes have led to the destruction of 16,000 houses, 14 monasteries, 45 mosques and three schools. And through it all, social media platforms have fanned the flames of hatred and mistrust. Alongside the online antagonists, Buddhist monk Wira Thu has been keen to promote his own brand of anti-Muslim propaganda. Jailed in 2003 for stirring up religious conflict, and released in 2012 under an amnesty, Wira Thu more recently created the 969 movement, which he says represents the Buddha, the Damah and the Sangha. More importantly, it serves as a counter to the 786 symbol used by Muslim communities in Myanmar, he said. Yet despite Wira Thu's seeming desire to stir up conflict, Kyaw Soe, general secretary of the All Myanmar Moulvi (Ulama Al Haque) organisation, said that 786 has nothing to do with Islam. ''It's just a lucky number that's popular within Muslim communities in Myanmar,'' he said. For months prior to the latest attacks on Muslims in Meiktila, Kyaw Soe said he was aware of trouble brewing. The riots were inevitable due to the efforts of Wira Thu's followers to stir up anti-Muslim sentiment among the public, he said, adding that he warned the Muslim community to stay away from the conflict. BUDDHIST BOYCOTT Earlier this year, Buddhist monks from Mon state organised an anti-Muslim campaign under the 969 banner. With the help of religious talks, DVDs and stickers they fomented bigotry and mistrust, encouraging Buddhists to shop only at Buddhist stores, to marry only other Buddhists and to support only their own communities. TENSE TIMES: Kyaw Soe, general secretary of the All Myanmar Moulvi, said he sensed trouble brewing. Ashin Issariya said he was surprised by the government's ignorance of the 969 movement and its seeming reluctance to respond to its antagonistic actions. ''It's really strange that the Ministry of Religious Affairs allowed the campaign to raise tension between the two groups,'' he told Spectrum. ''After the monks' protest in 2007, we were sentenced to 15 years in prison for using a single Gmail account. So why don't the authorities take action against a group that is openly running a campaign to stir up anti-Muslim sentiment?'' As well as the talks and DVDs, the sectarian views of the 969 movement are regurgitated and reinforced via countless social media sites, he said. ''This is a well planned campaign by a group of people that uses religious bigotry to further their political ambitions. I have warned my people not to become scapegoats,'' he said. Kyaw Soe said he wrote to Myint Swe, the chief minister of Yangon region in February, urging him to curb the activities of religious groups in the former capital that seek to incite hatred and violence. ''I just can't understand why the government has not taken any action to restrict that kind of religious movement. And I feel really sad for that,'' he said. Blogger Nay Phone Latt said he too ''has no idea why the government allows it [the 969 movement] to manipulate communities''. MURDER AND MANIPULATION Disputes between Myanmar's different racial and religious groups are not uncommon, but the violence that broke out in Rakhine last year and in Meiktila and other cities last month took the conflict to a whole new level. In Meiktila, the spark that ignited the violence is widely believed to have been a dispute between the Muslim owner of a gold shop and two would-be customers, both Buddhists. But what could, and probably should, have been nothing more than a minor spat rapidly escalated into mass murder and rioting. And all thanks to a group of anonymous online rabble-rousers, relentlessly banging the drum for intolerance and hatred via their blogs and websites. In the 10 days that followed the gold shop row, the riots spread from Meiktila to 14 other cities. The wave of violence left 43 people dead, 86 injured and more than 1,300 buildings _ mostly mosques, schools and the homes of Muslims _ destroyed. For bloggers such as Nay Phone Latt and Kyaw Soe, and the leader of the 88 Generation Students Group, Min Ko Naing, the government's failure to respond adequately to the unrest was clear evidence of its complicity. Recounting the interviews he conducted in Meiktila Muslim communities soon after the riots, Kyaw Soe said, ''Eyewitnesses told me that all the members of the mobs carried the same type of knife, which was about 60cm long. They also said that the men signalled to one another with whistles, so they were clearly well trained.'' Some of the rioters even disguised themselves as monks, he said. ''Several witnesses said they saw the men take off their robes and burned them with the dead bodies after the killings.'' The mobs were clearly being guided by people behind the scenes, he said. ''They killed only Muslims,'' he said. ''It was like genocide.'' What saddens Kyaw Soe most is that when they are not being manipulated by shadowy groups and their social media platforms, Myanmar's Buddhists and Muslims get along just fine. Indeed, during the riots and attacks in Meiktila, many Muslims were given refuge in the homes of their Buddhist neighbours, he said. ULTERIOR MOTIVES Creating instability and nurturing an atmosphere of mistrust and fear among different religious and ethnic groups has long been a tactic used by governments around the world to maintain control. They fan the flames of religious intolerance and ethnic hatred, so that when riots break out, the military has the excuse it needs to take to the streets and impose its rule. In his article ''The Vicious Cycle of Extreme Nationalism'' published on April 8 in Irrawaddy magazine, Czech Republic-based human rights campaigner Igor Blazevic wrote of the lessons he learned in his home country of Bosnia in the early 1990s. ''Ethnic cleansing does not come about because of spontaneous violence by a mob or by grassroots communities that allegedly hate each other,'' he said. ''It is usually the work of well-trained paramilitary groups organised by elements of the security apparatus. Their task is to do the dirty work without showing the direct link to the regular forces, officials and their political patrons.'' The recent killings in Meiktila were by no means the first of their kind in Myanmar. The massacres during the 1988 uprising, the attacks on Mrs Suu Kyi and her supporters in Depeyin in May, 2003, and the killing of 10 Muslim pilgrims in Taungup in May all pay testimony to the country's bloody past. Whether or not these atrocities were committed by military or paramilitary groups, the fact remains that the government did nothing to bring those responsible for the killings to justice. The rule of law in Myanmar would seem to apply only when the government deems it necessary to declare a state of emergency and put troops on the streets. The killings in Meiktila did, however, prompt a response from the government. President Thein Sein said that the efforts of ''political opportunists and religious extremists who try to exploit the noble teachings of these religions and have tried to plant hatred among people of different faiths for their own self-interest will not be tolerated''. According to Kyaw Soe, the president's words seem to confirm the presence of a controlling body, or puppet master, behind the conflicts. ''I really think that there might be a group within the government that doesn't want democracy, so they are doing all they can to disrupt the country's progress towards it,'' he said. ''If the government fails to identify who or what that is, the violence will continue.''"

Supanat Uthaisri, a volunteer at the Foundation of Child Understanding, said he has worked on anti-human trafficking campaigns in the region for a decade and has seen no evidence of a decline in people smuggling. On the contrary, he said the problem has worsened as traffickers use more sophisticated smuggling methods. People are being smuggled for use in various illegal trades including prostitution, pornography, forced labour and the organ trade. He cited sexual-oriented ""massage"" services as a business that was attracting a high number of human trafficking victims, particularly teenage girls. The service is known in Thai as nuad kapoo and involves naked female teenagers who use their bodies and hands to sexually stimulate their clients. He said the service was originally offered in Chiang Mai but has now spread to other provinces in the upper North. The young women can earn 10,000-50,000 baht per month depending on how much they work. Mr Supanat said economic problems and materialism attract teenage women to the illicit business while their employers are cashing in on the human trade. Empowerment of local communities, particularly in more remote provinces, would help combat the trade, he said. Community empowerment campaigns have successfully stymied the flow of young girls into the sex trade in the northern province of Phayao, he said. Ranee Wongprachuaplarp, the chief of social development and human security affairs in Phayao, said there had been only one case in the province of a Myanmar girl being lured into working in the sex industry. That was in 2003, and there have been no similar human-trafficking cases there since, she said. Ms Ranee said social development and human security officials and staff from non-governmental organisations have joined forces to protect young girls in the province from being lured into prostitution. Their campaigns focus on encouraging locals to watch out for procurers. Twenty community-based anti-human trafficking centres have been established in the province to protect local girls. There are plans to extend those facilities to cover all 68 tambons. Tawatwat Prompao, vice-president of the Phayao provincial administration organisation, said anti-human trafficking campaigns emphasised community empowerment because locals knew when strangers arrived at their villages. As communities are naturally concerned about the well-being of their youth, they can be persuaded to protect the young from being lured into the sex trade, he said. Charoensri Chaikhat, head of the Phayao Women's Network, said working groups were campaigning against human trafficking. They comprise government officials and representatives of non-governmental organisations and communities, and are targeting people who are potential victims of human trafficking. Chin Jaiyen, vice-chairwoman of the women's network, said her organisation had foiled a wedding between a South Korean man and a young Thai woman in Pong district of Phayao. The group was suspicious because the man planned to take the girl to South Korea immediately after the wedding, she said. When members of the network convinced the girl's parents to tell the man to stay in the village for a certain period, the man abandoned his marriage plans and fled."

The move was unveiled on Tuesday at a meeting between Thai and international police in Bangkok. Thai police are seen as lacking in enthusiasm to tackle this type of crime. ""Perhaps they have other crimes to deal with,"" Detective Inspector Jon Rouse, of the Child Safety and Sexual Crime Group in Australia, said. In Australia, sex-related crimes against children are regarded as severe and police get tough on people who use the internet as a channel to send and receive child porn, he said. ""I wonder why Thailand has no specific law to cope with this crime. Without such a law, police lack teeth to arrest wrongdoers,"" Det Insp Rouse told the opening of a three-day workshop on the issue among officers of the International Criminal Police Organisation, known as Interpol. The workshop ends Thursday. Many participants, including non-governmental organisations, agreed police need a stronger law to better protect children against paedophiles. Pol Gen Chatchawan Suksomchit, adviser to the Royal Thai Police, said police have acted only against people who distribute pornographic photos, and invoked the 2007 Computer-Related Crime Act to curb their dissemination on the internet. The possession of such porn is not illegal, he said. However, he said officers are drafting a law concerning behaviour that can lead to crimes, and are considering adding the possession of child pornography to the law. Police must consider what the intentions behind the behaviour are. For example, the word ""possession"" should not refer to ordinary porn but should clearly mean pornography of children aged under 18, and photos kept not for personal sexual pleasure but to victimise children. ""It is just such an act that will be considered as wrongdoing,"" said Pol Gen Chatchawan, also director of the centre for children and women protection and anti-human trafficking under the Royal Thai Police. The possession of child porn is viewed as a threat because many paedophiles use the pictures as a tool to lure children into imitating what they see in the photos. With this method, the number of new victims continues to rise, said Schle Woodthanan, deputy chairman of the Anti-Sexual Abuse in Children Foundation. He supports the proposal to brand the possession of child porn as illegal. Det Insp Rouse is willing to help Thai police by showing them how to track down wrongdoers in the cyber world. The suspects will usually find victims through Facebook or online games by pretending they are the same age as children, he said. Young internet users should be wary of posting their personal data and photos on the internet."

A girl surfs the web on her computer on February 27, 2013 in Chisseaux, France. A video of high school boys laughing about watching the rape of a ""dead"" drunk teenage girl who ""deserved to be peed on"" drew a horde of reporters to a small Ohio town for a trial Wednesday.	 While the video and a photo of two boys lifting the unconscious 16-year-old girl by her hands and feet were shocking and extreme, the dangerous combination of teens, alcohol and cameras was far from unique. Thousands of teenagers have found themselves in social hell after sexually explicit or other humiliating pictures and videos spread through social media like wildfire. The urge to document embarrassing, malicious -- or even potentially criminal -- moments is hard to resist for teenagers growing up in the digital age with a smartphone in their pocket at all times. It's a complex problem for parents, educators and police, who have to draw a line between youthful dalliances and crimes like extortion, harassment or the production of child pornography. Most of the images start out as a moment of youthful experimentation meant to be shared with a girlfriend, boyfriend or crush. Others are meant to be a joke. Then somebody hits send and the echo chamber of teenage gossip is magnified by the power of the Internet to produce an overwhelming tide of insults and abuse. And since the images are online forever, the victimization never really ends. ""We have girls -- 16, 17, 18-year-old girls -- telling us 'I'm contemplating suicide. I can't get my photos off this site,'"" said James McGibney, founder of bullyville.com, which aims to help bullied teens and adults. One in six US children aged 12 to 17 have received a sexually suggestive nude or nearly nude photo or video of someone they know, a recent study by the Pew Research Center found. That number goes up to one in three teens aged 16 and 17, even though only two percent of the children admitted to having ever sent a suggestive photo of themselves. ""The key thing to remember about this is it doesn't take that many people in a community to send these images for them to be widely shared,"" said Amanda Lenhart, Pew's director of teens and technology research. This makes growing up a lot harder for the current generation than it was for their parents. ""In the past, an indiscretion at a party, it would have been viewed by very few people. It could die down, be covered up, you make your apologies and go on with your life,"" Lenhart told AFP. ""Now, it can be hard to escape your past."" The Stubenville, Ohio rape case was certainly not a youthful indiscretion. But the fact that the boys shared the pictures they took after pulling off the girl's clothes and that the story went viral will undoubtedly make it harder for her to recover. ""There can be some serious impacts from the severe cases where there's been both a sexual victimization and on top of that the images are shared,"" said Patti Agatston, co-author of ""Cyber Bulling: Bullying in the Digital Age."" ""You could be dealing with some pretty serious psychological issues where someone may develop severe anxiety or post-traumatic stress disorder."" At a hearing in November, the girl's mother testified that she had been ostracized at school and still cried herself to sleep as a result of the August 11 incident. These kinds of painful images do, however, help bring problems to light and make it easier to punish those who cross the line. Assistant Ohio Attorney General Marianne Hemmeter said in opening statements Wednesday that the two high school football players accused of rape treated the girl like a ""toy"" and repeatedly degraded her by sending the photos to their friends. Defense attorneys dispute the prosecution's assertion that she was too drunk to consent and insist the boys' actions do not constitute rape. A recent study by the Crimes Against Children Research Center estimated that police investigated nearly 3,500 cases of youth-produced sexual images during 2008 and 2009. Two thirds of those cases involved ""aggravating"" circumstances such as ""adults interacting sexually with underage youth or young people engaging in blackmail or other criminal or malicious behavior, or recklessly circulating images."" The good news is that most of the images -- 63 percent -- were distributed by cellphone only and did not reach the Internet."

The Federal Courthouse in Manhattan where the trial of police officer Gilberto Valle, accused of conspiring to kidnap women that he planned to cook and eat, is being held in New York, February 25, 2013. The founder of an extreme fetish website used by the New York ""cannibal cop"" has testified that online chats about women being eaten were a typical fantasy and compared the forum to Facebook.	 Sergey Merenkov, the main witness called by suspended policeman Gilberto Valle's lawyers in a single day of defense arguments, told the court his site darkfetishnet.com, a favorite of the accused, was ""a social network."" Valle, 28, visited the site, most of whom's users live in the United States and Europe, for discussions on horrific -- but he claims entirely fictional -- scenarios about torturing, murdering and cannibalizing women. Prosecutors assert that Valle should be found guilty of conspiracy to kidnap women that he had talked about abducting and eating. But Valle's defense team hopes to persuade the jury that the policeman, who faces up to life in prison if convicted on the kidnapping conspiracy charge, is guilty of nothing more than unusual sexual fantasies. Merenkov, a Russian, advanced the case when discussing darkfetishnet.com, playing down the apparently macabre nature of its content. ""It's very similar to Facebook,"" Merenkov said in videotaped evidence given in Moscow, played in the Manhattan courtroom. The federal jury has been shown gruesome pictures downloaded onto Valle's computers, including women apparently being burned. It was not always clear when a picture had been staged or not. Closing arguments were scheduled for Thursday, after which the jury will start deliberating in a case that has gripped New York tabloid media. Merenkov, wearing a black T-shirt and sipping from a cup inscribed ""I (heart) TEA"" as he spoke to the camera, said his site had 38,000 registered members and about 4,500 used it on a near daily basis. In a point heavily underlined by defense lawyers, Merenkov said the first thing any visitor to his website sees is a warning, in bold, that ""this place is about fantasies only, so please play safe."" The site caters for all kinds of sexual interests, barring only child pornography and zoophilia, or human sex with animals, he said, naming asphyxia-related fetishes as among the most popular. There are other websites catering to the same audience, he said, including one far larger rival. Cannibalism was Valle's secret obsession, resulting in him spending hours every night on the computer before his wife and mother of their newborn child discovered what he was doing and fled the house last year, then told the FBI. However, Merenkov, 34, said his site was nothing more than a place where fetishists can chat and role play ""without being misunderstood."" ""It doesn't mean a person can go to the meat market and purchase a woman, then devour her,"" he said. Although his site is run from Moscow, 70 percent of members come from the United States and the largest other portion from western Europe, said Merenkov, who added that his principal employment is ""heading a company selling Spanish ice cream in Moscow."" Under cross-examination by the US prosecutor, Merenkov said that despite what he insisted was the generally safe nature of his site, he had booted members out when ""it seemed not to be fantasy anymore, that it could have led to something bad."" Pressed by the prosecutor that the self-proclaimed fantasy website includes photographs of ""dead women"" he countered that they were ""models, not real women."" However Merenkov acknowledged he could never be sure of what the pictures showed and that bloody crime scene photos had been included in the sex chats. ""We try to delete them,"" he said. No one was harmed by Valle, despite his numerous online chats about cannibalizing specific women he knew, including his now estranged wife, with other men. One of those men, Dale Bolinger, also known by his Internet handle as Moody Blue, has been arrested by British police on child pornography charges."

											Iceland's Internet porn ban sparks uproar										",https://search.bangkokpost.com/track/visitAndRedirect?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bangkokpost.com%2Fworld%2F337630%2Ficeland-internet-porn-ban-sparks-uproar&contentId=news337630,"REYKJAVIK — In the age of instant information, globe-spanning viral videos and the World Wide Web, can a thoroughly wired country become a porn-free zone? Authorities in Iceland want to find out. The government of the tiny North Atlantic nation is drafting plans to ban pornography, in print and online, in an attempt to protect children from a tide of violent sexual imagery. The proposal by Interior Minister Ogmundur Jonasson has caused an uproar. Opponents say the move will censor the Web, encourage authoritarian regimes and undermine Iceland's reputation as a Scandinavian bastion of free speech. Advocates say it is a sensible measure that will shelter children from serious harm. ""When a 12-year-old types 'porn' into Google, he or she is not going to find photos of naked women out on a country field, but very hardcore and brutal violence,"" said Halla Gunnarsdottir, political adviser to the interior minister. ""There are laws in our society. Why should they not apply to the Internet?"" Gunnarsdottir says the proposals currently being drawn up by a committee of experts will not introduce new restrictions, but simply uphold an existing if vaguely worded law. Pornography is already banned in Iceland, and has been for decades — but the term is not defined, so the law is not enforced. Magazines such as Playboy and Penthouse are on sale in book stores, and more hardcore material can be bought from a handful of sex shops. ""Adult"" channels form part of digital TV packages. Iceland's left-of-center government insists it is not setting out to sweep away racy magazines or censor sex. The ban would define pornography as material with violent or degrading content. Gunnarsdottir said the committee is still exploring the details of how a porn ban could be enforced. One possibility would be to make it illegal to pay for porn with Icelandic credit cards. Another, more controversial, route would be a national Internet filter or a list of website addresses to be blocked. That idea has Internet-freedom advocates alarmed. ""This kind of thing does not work. It is technically impossible to do in a way that has the intended effect,"" said Smari McCarthy of free-speech group the International Modern Media Institute. ""And it has negative side effects — everything from slowing down the Internet to blocking content that is not meant to be blocked to just generally opening up a whole can of worms regarding human rights issues, access to information and freedom of expression."" Despite its often chaotic appearance, the Internet is not a wholly lawless place. It is regulated, to varying degrees, around the world. Police monitor the net for child pornography and other illegal material, and service providers in many countries block offending sites. Some governments also censor the Internet at a national level — though the likes of authoritarian Iran, North Korea and China are not countries liberal Iceland wants to emulate. European countries including Britain, Sweden and Denmark ask Internet service providers to block child pornography websites, measures that have met with only limited opposition. But broader filtering has mostly been resisted. A few years ago, Australia announced it would introduce an Internet filtering system to block websites containing material including child pornography, bestiality, sexual violence and terrorist content. After an outcry, the government abandoned the plan last year. Critics say such filters are flawed and often scoop up innocent sites in their net — as when Denmark's child pornography filter briefly blocked access to Google and Facebook last year because of a glitch. On the streets of Iceland's capital, Reykjavik, there was some support for a porn ban, but also skepticism about how it would work. ""I think this is a good idea, but I think it might be problematic to implement this,"" said shop assistant Ragnheidur Arnarsdottir. ""It is difficult to fight technology."" Iceland's moves are being closely watched. It may be a tiny country of only 320,000 people, but its economic and social experiments — like its active volcanos — often have international impact. For centuries economically dependent on fishing, Iceland transformed itself in the early 21st century into a pioneer of aggressive credit-driven banking. Then in 2008, the country's debt-burdened banks all collapsed, making Iceland the first and most dramatic casualty of the global financial crisis, and leaving a string of failed businesses around the world. The economy is now bouncing back, aided by Iceland's status as one of the world's best connected countries, with one of the highest levels of Internet use on the planet. Recent initiatives to boost growth include plans to make Iceland a global center of media and technology freedom — a status that advocates like McCarthy fear could be threatened by an online porn ban. Anti-porn activists, however, are hailing Iceland as a pioneer. It is certainly not afraid to go its own way. Although the country has largely liberal Scandinavian values, it broke with most of Europe in 2010 by banning strip clubs. ""This is a country with courage,"" said Gail Dines, a professor of sociology and women's studies at Wheelock College in Boston and author of the book ""Pornland."" ""Iceland is going to be the first country with the guts to stand up to these predatory bullies from L.A. (in the porn industry),"" she said. ""It is going to take one country to show that this is possible."" But opponents say the project is both misguided and doomed. ""I can say with absolute certainty that this will not happen, this state filter,"" said Icelandic parliamentarian Birgitta Jonsdottir, a prominent advocate of online freedom. She is confident those drafting the anti-porn measures will see the error of their ways. They may also run out of time — Iceland is due to hold parliamentary elections in April, and the unpopular coalition government could be thrown out. Jonsdottir said the key to protecting children and others from hardcore harm is for citizens to better inform themselves about the Internet and how it works. ""People just have to make themselves a bit more knowledgeable about what their kids are up to, and face reality,"" she said. Gunnarsdottir, the political adviser backing the ban, just hopes the emotional debate around the issue will cool down. ""I think we should be able to discuss the Internet with more depth, without just shouting censorship on the one hand and laissez-faire on the other hand,"" she said. ""Is it freedom of speech to be able to reach children with very hardcore, brutal material? Is that the freedom of speech we want to protect?"""

The scam began when the virus infected the host computer, and showed this intimidating message. (Screencap by Malwaretips.com) Police detained 11 people as part of the operation, including a 27-year-old Russian suspected of creating and distributing the virus, Europol director Rob Wainwright told a news conference in Madrid. The virus locked computers in more than 30 countries, mostly in Europe, and it demanded payment of a fine of 100 euros (about 4,000 baht, $135) to return control to its user, he said. The message generated by the virus used the logo of the national police force and the language of the country where the computer was based to accuse the victim of having viewed child pornography or pirated movies online, he added. ""This operation is the first major operation of its kind,"" Wainwright said. ""This is an example of the evolving nature of cybercrime online, of how cybercrime is becoming more sophisticated."" The authorities said the cybercrime group raised millions of euros with its scam but could not yet cite a precise amount. They estimated that about three per cent of those whose computers were infected by the virus paid the fine that was demanded. Europol said in a statement that it was ""the largest and most complex cybercrime network dedicated to spreading police ransomware."" Police detained 10 people - six Russians, two Ukrainians and two Georgians - last week on Spain's Costa del Sol as part of the investigation, said Spain's secretary of state for security, Francisco Martinez. The suspected author of the virus was detained while he was on holiday in Dubai in December, he added. He is currently awaiting extradition to Spain. Of the 10 suspects detained in Spain, six have been remanded in custody while the investigation continues and the remaining four were released on bail. They are accused of fraud, money laundering, forging documents and membership of an organised crime group. The investigation remains open and further arrests are likely, police said. The authorities began their investigation, dubbed ""Operation Ransom"", in November 2011 after detecting the virus in six European countries. The network created 48 different versions of the virus to ensure that it was not detected by anti-virus software, said Martinez. So-called ""ransomware"" viruses, which try to make victims pay an on-the-spot fine, are becoming more prevalent but most strains only accuse people of pirating movies or music. Others scramble data that is only unscrambled when a fee is paid."

Aborigines perform for a Sydney exhibition on October 1, 2010. Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard warned that ""rivers of grog"" were beginning to flow again in Aboriginal communities as she unveiled a mixed report on tackling indigenous disadvantage.	 Gillard took aim at local governments rolling back strict alcohol bans on Aborigines in the nation's fifth annual ""Closing the Gap"" address on improving indigenous welfare, employment and education. She said progress was being made on several important measures including halving infant mortality for Aboriginal Australians, but warned that literacy and numeracy had slipped and called for a review of state alcohol policies. ""I have a real fear that the rivers of grog that wreaked such havoc among indigenous communities are starting to flow once again,"" the prime minister told parliament. ""We're hearing worrying reports about the rise in admissions to the emergency department at Alice Springs Hospital due to alcohol-related accidents and abuse,"" she added. ""People are witnessing more alcohol-related violence. In and around Alice Springs over the Christmas-New Year period there were at least five alcohol-related deaths."" Alcohol and pornography bans were a key plank of the so-called ""Intervention"" in the Northern Territory in 2007, when troops were sent in by the former conservative government following claims of child abuse and neglect. The new NT government dismantled a territory-wide banned drinkers register when it came to power last August, arguing that it failed to help with the problem and was unpopular with voters. Gillard called for its immediate reinstatement and warned the Queensland government, contemplating similar moves, to ""exercise extreme caution in reviewing remote community alcohol restrictions"". ""According to the then Northern Territory government, after (the register's) first year of operation, alcohol-related assaults dropped,"" she said. ""There were 10,000 fewer anti-social instances reported."" Now, Gillard said ""former banned drinkers are again on the long list of alcohol-related offences coming before the Alice Springs Magistrates Court each day"". Aborigines are the most disadvantaged Australians, with indigenous children twice as likely to die before their fifth birthday as other children and Aboriginal men estimated to die 11.5 years earlier than other males. They are believed to have numbered around one million at the time of British settlement in 1788, but there are now just 470,000 out of a total population of 22 million in Australia."

""We submit to the court's discretion and respect such decision to extend the TRO,"" she told AFP in a text message. ""It's not a total defeat.

President Benigno Aquino signed the law in September last year, amid huge online protests, to stamp out cybercrimes such as fraud, identity theft, spamming and child pornography. But opponents swiftly sued over provisions that authorise heavy prison terms for online libel and give the state powers to shut down websites and monitor online activities. The court in October issued a four-month injunction that was to have lapsed this week, as it scrutinised the law for possible violations of constitutional provisions on freedom of expression. De Lima did not say how long the new injunction would be in force and Supreme Court officials declined to comment. Aquino spokesman Ramon Carandang said the government acknowledged the public's concerns. He noted that even its chief lawyer, Solicitor-General Francis Jardeleza, had publicly acknowledged that shutting down websites may be illegal. ""As the president said, it's not a perfect law and even (Jardeleza) had questions about the takedown provisions,"" Carandang told AFP. Jardeleza however has also said this provision was not enough reason to strike down the entire law.

US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Director John Morton speaks as National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) CEO John Ryan (L) listens during a news conference January 3, 2013 at the ICE headquarters in Washington, DC. An international police operation into child pornography led to the arrest of 245 people and the rescues of 123 children, mostly in the US.	 John Morton, director of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency, said 23 of the suspects were arrested in six more countries, though declined to specify them. ""I can't, for very sensitive operational reasons, identify the countries involved,"" he said. Thirteen of the children were rescued outside the United States during Operation Sunflower -- a five-week operation from November 1 to December 7 aimed at identifying people who own, trade or produce child pornography. Among the children, 45 were under 12 years old, including five less than three years old. There were 70 girls and 53 boys, Morton noted, adding that 23 of the children have since reached the age of majority. Operation Sunflower was named in honor of the one-year anniversary of an investigation that started when Danish police found internet postings by a sixteen-year-old boy about his plans to rape an 11-year-old girl. Thanks to a photo posted online showing a highway sign with a sunflower, investigators were able to find the house of the boy in Kansas and rescue the girl. ICE works in partnership with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children which is now asking the public to help identify two adult suspects, shown molesting a young girl in a photograph taken 11 years ago. In 2012, a record 1,655 people suspected of sexually abusing children were arrested by the immigration enforcement agency, and 292 victims were identified and rescued."

This is not the only such case: two other joint police crackdowns coordinated by Europol over the past two years have resulted in more than 300 suspects being arrested. Suspects were identified in 30 countries, ranging from the US to Australia. Teachers and a boyscout leader were among the suspects arrested. As these cases show, those who prey on children operate globally, without regard to borders _ this is the reality that we must face and we must resolve. These criminals see the internet as one of their most valuable tools. The same internet that has helped revolutionise the way in which we conduct our everyday lives _ and that has allowed government reformers and others to unite around the world _ has also allowed perpetrators to widely disseminate images and videos of sexually abused children, while concealing the identities of the abusers. And each time an image or a video is spread further, that act of abuse is repeated again. So how do we halt these horrendous crimes? In order for us to truly make a difference, every country must increase its own efforts, and we must improve our international cooperation to target this pervasive problem. That is why, on Dec 5, we joined with representatives from 47 countries in Brussels to lay the foundation for a Global Alliance against Child Sexual Abuse Online, a joint initiative by the EU and the US. Thailand is participating and will have an important role in this initiative. Civil society representatives, experts and companies, will also participate in the launch. Along with the 27 EU member states and the US, the participating countries include, besides Thailand, European neighbours such as Turkey and Moldova, and also, among others, Nigeria, South Korea and Japan. With these countries on board from the beginning, and others joining hereafter, we will be able to tackle the legal and practical challenges to ending this scourge. We will work to eliminate legal loopholes that are exploited by the distributors of child abuse material. We will strengthen our efforts to make sure that the Interpol international database of child abuse material grows by 10% annually. We will make it easier to initiate joint cross-border police investigations. We will hold accountable those who prey upon our children. The countries of the alliance will commit themselves to strong action on the home front, by establishing dedicated law enforcement units dealing with these crimes. We will deepen our cooperation with civil society, such as with organisations that operate hotlines where the public can report findings of online child pornography. In addition, cooperation with internet service providers will be intensified, to better enable the timely sharing of information related to criminal investigations. Finally, we will seek to ensure that legislation is in place prohibiting child abuse offenders from working with children. For our efforts not to be in vain, raising awareness about these issues is absolutely imperative, since our ambition must be for all of us to feel safe when we are online. With better knowledge, young people can truly maximise their use of the net as a meeting place, and take full advantage of the vast resources it offers. Both children and parents should feel comfortable in embracing the possibilities provided by, for example, online social networks, while being made aware of how to avoid the dangers. All 49 countries in the alliance will now launch awareness campaigns, which is an important step in the right direction. Let us be clear: Europe and the US will continue to fiercely defend the open and free nature of the internet, while at the same time stopping those who try to use it for these despicable purposes. This reprehensible conduct is not about freedom of expression _ it is about criminals who physically abuse children, take pictures or videos, and distribute these over the internet. Recipients of child pornography do not merely possess the pictures _ they support child abuse by engaging in its dissemination. The alliance that we are launching today aims to strengthen our resources to identify more victims of child sexual abuse, and ensure that they receive our help and support. We must bring more perpetrators to justice, fight the dissemination of child abuse material online, and increase awareness of how these crimes are carried out. To reach these goals, greater national efforts and increased international cooperation are the only ways forward. We already know what is at stake: After our cross-border police operations against paedophile networks in 2011 and 2012, authorities identified and safeguarded over two hundred children who had become victims. With the global alliance in place, we pledge to help many more. Cecilia Malmstrom is EU Commissioner and Eric Holder is US Attorney General."

Web-surfing Russians endured a brief scare Wednesday that the authorities had blocked YouTube after the video-sharing website appeared on a list of banned addresses, in what officials later called a ""technical mistake"".	 The new registry of blacklisted websites introduced this month showed the website youtube.com as having been added there Wednesday by Russia's consumer protection agency and remained on it for several minutes. After a media furore swiftly ensued, the agency's head Gennady Onishchenko told Russian news agencies that the intention was to ban 22 specific videos, rather than the whole service, notably ones giving instructions on how to commit suicide. The spokesman for communications ministry's watchdog responsible for the website registry Vladimir Pikov told AFP that the incident a ""technical mistake"", without giving further explanations. Russians have been worried about an impending Internet crackdown ever since the hasty recent passage of a law which introduced the concept of the blacklist. Supporters said it was necessary for blocking harmful content, including suicide manuals, child pornography, and information on illicit drugs, but critics saw it as yet another measure to suppress free speech following President Vladimir Putin's election to a historic third term in May. The legislation was protested by many global websites, including Russian search engine Yandex and Wikipedia, who warned that the mechanism behind the blacklist could be used for a blanket shutdown of popular social networks."

We are a regional leader in this area, with strong education and healthcare policies that have vastly improved children's quality of life. Thailand has made significant progress in improving children’s rights, but many challenges remain. SOMKID CHAIJITVANIT Children across the country now have the right to 12 years of free education. Public health policies have reduced infant mortality from 34 out of 1,000 live births in 1990 to only 14 out of 1,000 in 2010. These, amongst other developments, are impressive markers of our progress as a nation. However, we are still on a journey to combat injustices against children, such as child pornography, sexual abuse and a juvenile justice system that does not yet fully meet international standards. Nov 20 also marks the 23rd anniversary of the United Nations' Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). The CRC is a foundational human rights treaty ratified as law by all but two countries in the world, committing governments and us as citizens to promoting the well-being of children. But the most recent milestone date for Thailand is Sept 26 2012, on which we became one of the first two countries in the world to ratify the new Optional Protocol to CRC. The Optional Protocol gives children whose rights are violated the option to have their cases reviewed by the Committee on the Rights of the Child in Geneva, Switzerland. This process presents an opportunity for the Thai government to receive suggestions from the Committee of experts on how to improve our systems for ensuring every child enjoys his or her full rights. The Royal Thai Government should be applauded for committing itself to being held accountable for children's rights by ratifying the new Optional Protocol. Despite this progress, if Thailand is to continue to be a regional leader on child rights, there are still a number of concerns that we must work together with the government to address. Last year, a review of Thailand's performance with regard to the CRC and its earlier Optional Protocols by the United Nations' Committee on the Rights of the Child raised a number of issues requiring attention. For example, Thailand still lacks a law that specifically defines and punishes child pornography, though children as young as 10 years old can still be held responsible for crimes. Moreover, adults who sexually abuse children can still be released on bail pending trial, giving them the opportunity to continue abusing children or even flee the country. At this stage, our children are not yet enjoying the full protection they deserve. Importantly, even the aforementioned advances in health and education are not accessible to everyone. In most cases, children of migrants and those without Thai identity documents are excluded from low-cost healthcare. They often face difficulties accessing education due to financial pressures, lack of transportation and a shortage of programmes to help them overcome language and cultural barriers. To illustrate, on a recent visit to hill tribe communities in Chiang Mai province I met Ohm, a 10 year-old boy who spends every evening selling flowers to passing cars to help his family earn money. He rarely has time to do his homework and, because his parents do not speak Thai, studies slower than most of his peers. His parents do not value education, preferring that their son make a living by selling flowers illegally. The family lacks Thai identity documents and therefore cannot access the 30-baht health scheme that could provide care for Ohm's ailing younger brother. The uncomfortable reality is that Ohm's story is not unique, but rather representative of the struggles of many of Thailand's most vulnerable children. At the regional level, the need for legal harmony in child rights protection has never been greater, as we look to the dawn of the Asean Economic Community's integration in 2015. In three years, migration across borders is expected to increase significantly throughout Southeast Asia, exposing children to greater risk. A number of NGOs _ including World Vision Foundation of Thailand, Plan Thailand, Child Line and Life Skills Development Foundation, amongst others _ are working together to create change in partnership with government and communities. We recognise that alignment with the CRC and its Optional Protocols on these key issues before 2015 is a key part of spurring progress both at home and throughout the Asean region. This is a prime window of opportunity for the Thai government, in collaboration with civil society, to continue to be a human rights leader in Asean, serving as an example of good practice in protecting children's rights for our peers. However, no matter how firm its commitment, a government can only protect children's rights through the support and engagement of all its citizens. Protecting the rights guaranteed by treaties and legislation is a responsibility we must all share. As parents, grandparents and citizens, we must shun indifference, accept responsibility and do our part. What can you do? Here are some ways you can help protect children's rights: - Talk with your children today about their rights. Teach them ways to protect themselves from risky situations. - Contact your child's teacher and express your support for a human rights curriculum and for teaching children how to protect themselves. - Contact concerning NGOs and volunteers to support activities that promote children's rights. - Reach out to your MP or local government to express your views on child pornography law, juvenile justice, bail for sex offenders against children or access to education and healthcare. Your government represents you, and expressing your priorities can motivate them to action. - Join your community committee for child protection, education and/or other related issues. You can find out more information from your local government office, the Ministry of Social Welfare or the Ministry of Education.

A call by two Dutch sexologists for ""virtual"" child pornography to be legalised so as to assuage paedophiles' desires has sparked fierce debate in the Netherlands.	 Sexologists Rik van Lunsen and Erik van Beek of Amsterdam University Hospital (AMC) last month floated the idea of creating child pornography using drawings or computer-generated images. ""If you make virtual child pornography under strict government control with some kind of label explaining that no child was abused, you can give paedophiles a way of regulating their sexual urges,"" Van Beek told AFP, calling for an enquiry or at least public debate on the issue. Virtual child pornography -- including drawings, paintings or computer-generated images -- was made illegal in 2002 as rapidly developing technology made increasingly photorealistic images possible. As with ""traditional"" child porn, creating, owning or sharing such images is currently punishable by up to four years in prison in the Netherlands. ""I think that repressing your fantasies can lead to frustration and, ultimately, for some types of paedophile, to a greater likelihood of doing something wrong,"" Van Beek said. Around one percent of the Dutch population of 16.5 million has paedophile preferences, mainly men, but only a tiny fraction will ever abuse children, noted the sexologist. Many of them will moreover never feel the need to live their sexuality through child pornography. The two sexologists' suggestion sparked fierce debate in Dutch media, blogs and discussion forums, as the idea has turned out to be controversial even in the free-thinking Netherlands. For former parliament speaker Gerdi Verbeet, ""it's really not a good idea"". ""It would be an enormous responsibility for the government,"" she said during a debate on public television, noting that it might also be impossible to tell the virtual images from the real. Crime journalist Peter de Vries said during the same debate that the proposal ""could work"", but that the potential problems were many. ""How far should it go? How realistic should the images be?"" he asked. Internet discussion forums overflowed with mostly critical comments, from ""Don't do this to our children!"" to asking why paedophiles don't just use their imagination. ""The proposal isn't really pertinent and for some people it will certainly increase the likelihood of going through with it (sexual abuse),"" warned psychotherapist Jules Mulder of the De Waag clinic. Mulder, who specialises in treating paedophiles, noted that it would be very difficult to cover all ""tastes"". ""Some want photos of naked children, others want children having sex while someone else wants an eight-year-old boy with dark hair and a certain look in his eyes,"" he said. ""It's not possible to satisfy these different desires with a bit of virtual child pornography."" MP Myrthe Hilkens from the left-leaning PvdA party has put questions to Justice Minister Ivo Opstelten on the matter and he is to issue a written reply in the coming days. The sexologists know their proposal is controversial but they also want to break what they say is a taboo. ""We don't make enough of a distinction in public debate between 'healthy' paedophiles, people who are not paedosexually active, and delinquent paedosexuals,"" said Van Lunsen, the head of the AMC's sexology department. ""We're not responsible for our thoughts or our fantasies, we're only responsible for one thing: our actions."" Most paedophiles who come to Van Lunsen for consultation have ""a major feeling of guilt"", have sometimes attempted suicide and ask him to ensure they are never tempted to abuse children. ""Regardless of the question of whether this can reduce abuse, I think that it's a courageous proposal,"" Jos de Mul, anthropologist at Rotterdam's Erasmus University, told the Protestant Trouw newspaper a few days after it published the initial story. ""They're breaking an enormous taboo."" But the Dutch branch of the Defence for Children International charity said that it was opposed to the proposal. ""It's preferable for paedophiles to learn to control themselves in a different way,"" it said."

Australia on Friday scrapped a controversial plan to filter the Internet, saying it will instead block hundreds of websites identified by Interpol as among the worst child abuse sites. The centre-left Labor government had pushed since 2007 for a mandatory Internet filter to protect children, to be administered by service providers, despite criticism it was impractical and set a precedent for censorship. But Communications Minister Stephen Conroy said the government had now reached an agreement with Internet providers that they would block ""the worst of the worst"" child abuse material that is available on the web to the public. ""Blocking the Interpol 'worst of' list meets community expectations and fulfils the government's commitment to preventing Australian Internet users from accessing child abuse material online,"" Conroy said in a statement. ""Given this successful outcome, the government has no need to proceed with mandatory filtering legislation."" Former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd pledged to introduce a mandatory filter in 2007, with Internet providers required to block all sites as identified by the Australian Communications and Media Authority. The idea was that the filter would bar access to material such as rape, drug use, bestiality and child sex abuse. But web giants such as Google, Yahoo! and Microsoft slammed the initiative as setting a precedent for censorship, while cyber-activists likened it to firewalls operating in China and Iran. The plan, which had also drawn concern from the US State Department, was put on hold pending a content review in July 2010 as national elections loomed. Under the new agreement, Australia's major Internet service providers (ISPs), accounting for some 90 percent of Internet users, will block child abuse websites on Interpol's ""worst of"" child abuse list. Australian Federal Police will make contact with the remaining ISPs to help them meet their obligation under the new plan, which is similar to the approach adopted in Britain, Canada and Scandinavian countries, said Conroy. The Internet Industry Association chief Peter Lee welcomed the initiative. ""Blocking the Interpol 'worst of' list is a positive step in preventing Australian Internet users from committing the offence of accessing child abuse material,"" he said. Online rights campaigners also welcomed the decision as ""a win for common sense"", but said most child abuse material was not readily available on the open web. The Australian Christian Lobby told the ABC a filter was needed to protect children from pornography and other unwholesome material."

An Internet cafe in Moscow. Russia on Thursday put into force a new law on the Internet that allows the government to block websites with banned content, prompting fears that it will be used to suppress free speech.	 The law, which was hastily voted in by the parliament despite opposition from major Internet companies, is officially intended to protect children from viewing unsuitable content. It targets sites that contain child pornography, information on drugs or calls to commit suicide. It also includes sites that a court has ruled extremist. But critics say its wording could be exploited to block opposition websites by planting banned material, potentially shutting down the most lively forum for political debate in Russia. ""We are forced to conclude that no political will exists to resolve the law's contradictions and to eliminate those that pose threats to freedom,"" Reporters Without Borders said in a critical statement. Even the communications minister has warned that the law could be used to block a resource such as YouTube in Russia. The government media watchdog opened a website, www.zapret-info.gov.ru, that will publish the list of banned sites. It said its experts had blacklisted six sites containing child pornography and that the owners had been informed by e-mail. Its website does not reveal which sites, since users must enter an exact address to check whether a page or a site is listed. The owner of the site or web host then has three days to remove content or block access. If the site is still accessible, Internet service providers are obliged to block it, without any court decision necessary. The site had been viewed more than 100,000 times and has fought off several hacker attacks, the watchdog said. When the law was first proposed, the Russian version of the online encyclopaedia Wikipedia protested with a temporary shutdown, while top search engine Yandex.ru ran a black banner on its main page. The law's wording was then softened to make it less widely applicable. Yet Communications Minister Nikolai Nikiforov warned in September that the law could be used to block Russians' access to YouTube over its postings of the anti-Islam film that sparked deadly rioting. ""It sounds like a joke, but because of this video ... all of YouTube could be blocked throughout Russia,"" he wrote on Twitter. However he later clarified his comment, saying that while this was a theoretical possibility, he expected major Internet resources to abide by the law."

Customers at an Internet cafe in Manila look at Facebook profiles that have turned black as part of a protest against a cybercrime bill that took effect on October 3. The Philippine Supreme Court has suspended a controversial cybercrime law, amid huge online protests over fears it would impose severe curbs on Internet freedoms.	 The court declared in a brief written notice that the law would be suspended for four months while the tribunal studies the arguments for and against it. ""The court resolved... to issue a temporary restraining order, effective immediately and for a period of 120 days, enjoining the respondents from implementing and/or enforcing (the cybercrime act),"" it added. Such an order stops Philippine laws from taking effect until further orders from the court, while making no immediate judgment on their legality. The court said it will hear the case on January 15 next year. Justice Secretary Leila de Lima said the government will follow the court's order. ""The Supreme Court temporary restraining order is an exercise of the power of judicial review. We respect and will abide by it,"" de Lima told reporters. ""Our advocacy for a safe cyberspace and interdiction of organised crime will continue,"" she added. The 15-member Supreme Court held a meeting behind closed doors Tuesday to discuss petitions seeking to outlaw the cybercrime act. Riot police deployed outside the court as about 100 of its opponents as well as supporters staged rival but peaceful protests. The law, which went into force last week, seeks to stamp out non-controversial cybercrimes such as fraud, identity theft, spamming and child pornography. However one provision which metes out heavy jail terms for online libel, tougher than for defamation in the traditional media, has caused an uproar. Equally controversial is a provision that allows the government to shut down websites and monitor online activities, such as video conversations and instant messaging, without a court order. Human rights groups, media organisations and netizens have voiced their outrage at the law, with some saying it echoes the curbs on freedoms imposed by dictator Ferdinand Marcos in the 1970s. Philippine social media has been alight with protests, while hackers have attacked government websites and petitions have been filed with the Supreme Court calling for it to overturn the law. Opponents hailed the court order but urged it to go a step further by striking down the law. Senator Teofisto Guingona, one of at least 13 people or groups to have asked the court to strike down the law, said: ""With this temporary restraining order, the tyrannical powers granted by the law are effectively clipped."" Brad Adams, Asia director for New York-based rights monitor Human Rights Watch, said in a statement: ""The court should now go further by striking down this seriously flawed law."" A group of Filipino bloggers calling themselves the Philippine Internet Freedom Alliance urged parliament to replace it with one that upholds freedom of expression. ""(The alliance) vows to bring the fight to the halls of Congress to ensure that this legislative abomination gets repealed,"" it said in a statement. Meanwhile a group called the Responsible Internet Social Empowerment urged the Supreme Court and the parliament to uphold the law as it stands. ""Prior to the enactment of the new law, how many cybercriminals are enjoying their freedom to escape liability and punishment because there is no law covering their felonious acts?"" said its spokesman Alex Deita."

Hackers incensed by the Philippines' controversial cybercrime law have attacked government sites that deliver emergency information during natural disasters, an official said Saturday.

The Philippines sits on the ""ring of fire"" of tectonic activity that generates earthquakes around the Pacific, and is also regularly hit by typhoons, with the agencies' online arms providing citizens with disaster data and advice. Valte reported the attacks a day after Aquino set out a broad defence of the cybercrime law, which seeks to stamp out offences such as fraud, identity theft, spamming and child pornography. But it has sparked a storm of protests from critics who say it will severely curb Internet freedoms and intimidate netizens into self-censorship. One of its most controversial elements mandates much longer jail sentences for people who post defamatory comments online than those who commit libel in traditional media. It also allows the government to monitor online activities, such as e-mail, video chats and instant messaging, without a warrant, and to close down websites it deems to be involved in criminal activities. The Supreme Court is hearing petitions to have the law declared illegal. Aquino, whose mother led the ""people power"" revolution that toppled the military-backed Ferdinand Marcos regime in 1986, said he remained committed to freedom of speech.

Customers at an Internet cafe in Manila look at Facebook profiles that have turned black as part of a protest against a cybercrime bill that took effect on October 3.	 Major news outlets, bloggers, rights groups and other critics turned their social media profile pages black to express outrage over the law, which could see people face long jail terms for posting defamatory comments online. Thousand of furious tweets were posted on Twitter, with the hashtag #notocybercrimelaw becoming the top trend on the microblogging site in the Philippines on Wednesday. ""This law works against ordinary netizens and disregards, among other things, our right to privacy and freedom of expression,"" tweeted Noemi Dado, a prominent Manila blogger who edits a citizen media site called Blog Watch. Senator Teofisto Guingona, one of the few members of parliament who opposed the bill that President Benigno Aquino signed into law last month, also stepped up his campaign to have it overturned. ""The implementation of the law... will take back our citizens to the Dark Ages where freedom of speech and expression were not recognised,"" he said in a statement. Many provisions of the cybercrime law aim to fight a range of online crimes not deemed controversial, such as fraud, identity theft, spamming and child pornography. However one provision makes any libellous comments posted online a criminal offence, with a penalty of up to 12 years in jail, much tougher than for traditional media. Equally controversially, the Department of Justice also now has the power to close down websites and monitor online activities, such as email, instant messaging or video chats, without a warrant. The Philippines has had one of Asia's most vibrant democracies and robust media environments since a people power revolution led by Aquino's mother toppled dictator Ferdinand Marcos in 1986. Social media has also flourished in recent years. Nearly a third of the population of 100 million people has access to the Internet, and 96 percent of Filipino web users use Facebook, according to industry figures. But critics of the law have said it echoes tactics to silence and monitor dissenters employed by Marcos when he imposed martial law in the 1970s. ""The Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 is the worst assault on free expression since Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law,"" Luis Teodoro, a journalism professor at the University of the Philippines, wrote in a blog. Joaquin Bernas, a Jesuit priest and lawyer who helped draft the country's post-dictatorship constitution in 1987, voiced similar sentiments in an article published this week outlining his concerns about the law. ""There are very valid reasons for being frightened by this,"" Bernas wrote in the Philippine Daily Inquirer, highlighting the government's new authority to monitor and close down suspect websites without a warrant. ""I for one recall the law on search and seizure in effect during the past martial law period."" Aquino's spokespeople have repeatedly defended the law as necessary to fight cybercrime, while insisting his administration would uphold freedom of speech online. They also said a spate of hacking on government websites in protest over the law highlighted the need for it. But amid the backlash, some of the politicians who voted for the bill said they would were willing to get rid of the controversial provisions. ""At the end, we should be humble enough to admit we may have made a mistake and we can still amend the law,"" said Congressman Sonny Angara, whose father, Senator Edgardo Angara, authored the cybercrime bill. Critics have also filed petitions to the Supreme Court calling on it to rule that the law is unconstitutional."

Aquino has signed into law a bill to combat cybercrime, his spokeswoman said, in a bid to stamp down on everything from forgery to child pornography.	 The bill will be a boost to law-enforcers who have previously complained of difficulty charging people who use the Internet to commit crimes as there were no legal codes that penalise their acts. Aquino's spokeswoman Abigail Valte said the bill covered most forms of hacking, defining cybercrimes to include ""offences against the confidentiality, integrity and availability"" of a computer system, as well as gaining illegal access to or interception of data. The bill also defines ""computer-related offences"" for forgery, fraud, identity theft, cybersex and child pornography. Spamming as well as ""cyber-squatting"" -- the use of an Internet domain name to mislead consumers, destroy other's reputations or prevent them from using their name -- were included in the bill. The law also punishes libel, Valte said, though asked if this would cover even messages sent on social network websites such as Twitter, she added the state would ""leave it up to other lawyers to determine"".  The bill also calls for the creation of a ""Cybercrime Investigation and Coordinating Center"" that will implement the law, she said. Valte did not say what penalties will be imposed for different offences under the new law. In 2000, two Filipino computer students were accused of releasing the ""ILOVEYOU"" computer virus that infected computers worldwide, destroying millions of computer files and causing millions of dollars in damage.

Should any person, military or otherwise be injured or killed using them, then charge those who assessed, procured and/or ordered their use with either criminal neglect, deliberately conspiring to injure personnel or murder.

BOB ALFORDLampang It was nice to read in Sunday morning's selection of letters praise for the Immigration Bureau. The Immigration Bureau is the greatest enigma in Thailand for both newcomers and those living here for a multitude of years. I've lived in many areas in Thailand and have found that the rules, regulations, requirements, etc, although supposed to be standard throughout the kingdom, as set by the Central Immigration Bureau in Bangkok, tend to vary from province to province. I've never understood why. Friends renewing visas have had to provide more documentation, others less. Some people I know have been really hassled and made to feel unwelcome, while others walk away with such positive experiences that they glowed. Some regional Immigration Bureau officers are wonderful and helpful, while others really do enjoy power-tripping and enjoy seeing a cowering non-Thai in front of them. Nothing is ever going to be perfect until the Central Bureau of Immigration standardises its requirements across the entire country and enforces these standards with spot-checks on their employees as well. The Tourism Authority of Thailand is always so concerned about the kingdom's image. The Immigration Bureau should be as well. Granted, the bureau has a very difficult job in trying to keep out undesirables, but it should strive to present its friendlier side as well. YELLOW YARMULKE Once again, like Christmas, some kid with a credit card and a subscription to a gun magazine has decided to load up and make the news. James Holmes' victims didn't die because of ''fate'', or as ''part of God's unfathomable plan'', but rather, because in America, a man can order up to 6,000 rounds of ammunition as easily as a box of nails, because in America we believe that making it hard to buy a weapon of mass murder puts an unnecessary burden on guys who want to shoot geese. On the talk shows today and tomorrow, we'll be told that such tragic deaths help remind us that we never know how much time we have left on Earth. That's wrong. Such tragedies should teach us that owning weapons of mass murder and massive amounts of ammunition is, by nature, a crime against humanity, as sick and twisted as owning child pornography. Possessing devices that can quickly murder dozens of people is as vile as owning magazines that encourage sex with children, and should be treated as such, as a sick perversion. What will prevent similar horrors in the future? The NRA (National Rifle Association) spokesmen you'll hear on the news over the next few days will say that making loaded military-grade weapons illegal is wrong, because the crooks will get them anyway. Honestly, that makes as much sense as saying that crack cocaine should be legal, because people who want it will get it anyway. In fact, the pro-gun arguments you hear today will only accomplish one thing: make certain that more people like James Holmes will have a smooth path from thought to plan to action. OLYVIA AGG It wasn't entirely Cambodia's fault that the Asean meeting concluded without a unified statement. Cambodia's representative was under sustained pressure from the Chinese ''observer'' delegation regarding the islands in the South China Sea. China didn't want any language in a statement which inferred the ownership of any of the islands was under dispute. Instead, China wants all of SE Asia to go along with its imperative that it owns all the islands outright _ similar to its wanting everyone to accept that it owns Tibet and Taiwan. If anyone happens to be looking for a definition of ''imperialism'', no need to look further than present-day China. Cambodia is controlled by one man, who also happens to be bosom buddies with another man who politically controls Thailand. If you look closely at their personalities, you'll better understand why they make the wrong-headed decisions they do. KIP KEINOBan Nam Lat If we look at the problems Thaksin Shinawatra is facing and apply the teachings of the Buddha, we can see these ancient principles are never wrong. One of the core principles of Buddhism is that desire causes suffering. Thaksin had the blessing of more wealth than most people would see in a hundred lifetimes. Obviously he was still unsatisfied so used his political position to subvert policy so he could become even richer. Buddhism explains that every cause must have an effect; we reap what we sow. When the wheel turned and it was time for him to face the consequences of his previous actions, he ran away and denied wrong doing. Thaksin then faced another great truth, impermanence. All things that originate in time must eventually dissolve in time. Rather than accept he alone had created his own fate, he then sought to defy change and blamed others for the problems he himself created. This is another great principle: attachment. Society readily acknowledges the attachment and addiction some have to drugs and gambling, but we don't see that the attachment to the ego, money and power can be even more destructive. Thaksin should contemplate Buddhism's highest principle; there is no ''ego'', ''entity'' or personal ''self''. There is just the ''self''. If this is really seen, you then have to ask whose face or ego is trying to be saved? The acceptance of ''what is'' rather than ''what should be'' would be a good place for him to start. Compassion, forgiveness, kindness, happiness and peace do not have to be cultivated; they are our natural state when we awaken from the illusion of the personal self, and all of its desires and cravings are seen to be nothing but a mirage.

Russia's State Duma deputies speak in May 2012. The Russian parliament on Wednesday voted to approve a contentious bill that activists fear will introduce Internet censorship by blacklisting sites deemed as undesirable.	 In a further controversial move, deputies also passed in first reading a bill that makes libel and slander criminal offences with punishment of up to five years. ""The goal of the bill is to wipe out dissent in our country,"" Communist deputy Anatoly Lokot exclaimed at the hearings as other opposition deputies said that restrictive bills are introduced faster than they can read them. The two bills are criticised as likely to be used against the opposition and follow initiatives hiking protest fines and introducing the term ""foreign agents"" for NGOs with funding from abroad. The trend to fast-track certain bills after their introduction by majority party United Russia led some critical lawmakers to compare the parliament to a ""secretarial office"" of the Kremlin. The Russian-language version of Wikipedia went on strike the day earlier in protest at the bill that is advertised as a crackdown on child pornography by creating a register of blacklisted sites and obliges site owners and providers to close them. ""Imagine a world without free knowledge,"" it said, blocking access to the site. The site was back up on Wednesday as deputies passed the bill with next to no debate or public discussion. ""Mind boggling,"" opposition leader Alexei Navalny wrote on Twitter after even opposition deputies voted to pass the law, calling them ""idiots."" In Washington, the US State Department voiced its concerns. ""As Secretary (of State Hillary) Clinton has noted, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights guarantees the right 'to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers',"" said spokesman Patrick Ventrell. The bill has to be signed by President Vladimir Putin and is expected to become law in November. Russian newspapers said Wednesday the final version had narrowed a previously broad term of ""harmful information"", saying only child pornography, suicide how-to instructions and drugs propaganda can lead to website closure without a trial. However, an expert on Russia's security services, Andrei Soldatov, said the bill would lead to creation of a mechanism for blocking foreign sites for the first time by forcing Internet providers to install special equipment. ""Clearly, it will be possible to use it not just against websites propagating pornography; the government will be able to use these instruments any way it wants,"" he wrote on his website Agentura.ru. Russia's biggest search engine Yandex said the bill's proposed methods to fight pornography ""create room for possible misuse and raise questions from Internet users and company representatives."" ""Such decisions cannot be taken hastily, the way it is happening now,"" said the statement signed by the company's chief editor Yelena Kolmanovskaya. The engine's slogan ""Everything will be found"" had the word 'everything' crossed out on the main page on Wednesday. ""The amendments can lead to introduction of censorship to Russian Internet,"" said Livejournal, a popular blogging platform frequently used by opposition leaders for communicating with their audience. The new libel bill breezed through the voting process in the parliament in the first reading and could be passed before the end of this week before the Duma session ends for summer break. The bill creates a new criminal charge making slander and libel subject to a jail term of up to five years. The charge was previously decriminalised during Dmitry Medvedev's presidency under the drive to liberalise the criminal code. Opposition deputies on Wednesday decried what they said was a trend of introducing restrictive bills at short notice and ramming them through without any public discussion. ""We are turning the parliament into an secretarial office that carries out somebody else's wishes,"" opposition deputy Gennady Gudkov of the Just Russia party said at the hearings."

The amendments to an existing information law are being promoted as a crackdown on child pornography in particular, but the Ru.Wikipedia.org site warned that they could ""prompt the creation of a Russian version of the Great Firewall of China"". Passed in its first reading on Friday, the bill calls for the creation of a federal register that would rule on websites carrying banned information and oblige site owners and providers to close down the offending sites.

""There is a great risk of censorship appearing on the Russian Internet."" In a storm of comment, Russia's main Internet companies including Yandex and Mail.ru Group backed Wikipedia's objections to the bill. The bill comes as part of an apparent trend to use the pliant Duma lower house dominated by the ruling United Russia party to rubber-stamp laws that can be used against the opposition. It has recently pushed through legislation ramping up fines for protesters and stigmatising internationally-funded NGOs as ""foreign agents"". Protest leader Alexei Navalny slammed the bill on his popular blog saying it would ""move the Internet in the direction of the Zombie Box,"" a slang term for Kremlin-controlled television. The bill cites websites carrying child pornography, promoting drug use and encouraging children to commit suicide, saying the decision to blacklist these would be taken by an unnamed federal agency. It said that sites would also be blacklisted under vague extremism laws, which can be enforced by the ruling of a single district court. Under the bill, an entire site could be blacklisted over the content of one page. The bill was proposed by the Duma's family, women and children committee, an all-party group. It has already prompted high-level opposition. The presidential council on human rights -- a purely advisory body --- last week slammed the bill, calling it ""the introduction of censorship"" and a ""new electronic curtain"" descending on Russia. And the newly appointed minister of communications, Nikolai Nikiforov, Russia's youngest at 30, took the unusual step Tuesday of criticising it on Twitter. ""I do not support Wiki's decision to close. But this step is an important reaction from society, a sign that we need to amend the bill,"" he wrote. ""The idea of fighting child pornography on the net is correct. But the Internet as a whole must remain a free environment."" He predicted that the bill would be passed in its crucial second reading, saying that industry representatives and experts should work over the summer on amendments. Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, who broke the mould by using social media as president, has also criticised the bill, Vedomosti business daily reported Tuesday, citing a source in a major internet company. In neighbouring Belarus, strongman leader Alexander Lukashenko has cracked down on the Internet, creating a centre to monitor those who access suspicious sites and requiring Internet cafes to keep records of users. The bill's second reading is timetabled for Wednesday. If passed it will go through several other votes seen as a formality before being signed into law by President Vladimir Putin. In Russia, the Internet plays a crucial role in disseminating opposition views through social networking sites including Facebook, Twitter and Live Journal and is also used to coordinate protests."

In Austria alone, operation ""Carole"" found 272 suspects, making it the biggest ever police sweep against child pornography in the small alpine country, police said. The investigations, which lasted almost a year, began in Luxembourg when the operator of a root server based there reported two websites containing large quantities of child pornography to the authorities. The websites' files, indicating a worldwide clientele, were seized by police and passed on to investigators in 141 countries, Austrian police said, without elaborating on the countries or the number of people involved. The 272 Austrian suspects, all male and aged 17 to 70, came from all types of background and professions, including teachers and kindergarten staff. All of them were found in possession of paedophile images or videos. The vast majority were consumers, but in two cases, actual abuse of children could be proven, police said. Searches at the suspects' homes turned up vast amounts of material, which were currently being examined. In March 2011, an Europol sweep identified 670 suspects and made 184 arrests in what was then the biggest case of its kind."

Chinese artist and dissident Ai Weiwei pose for a photo inside his home in Beijing. ""I hope I can travel. This is an important part of freedom. This is also a human right,"" Ai told AFP of the ban on leaving China imposed last week despite the expiry of a year-long bail term.	 ""I can swim, but not far,"" Ai told AFP of the ban on leaving China imposed last week despite the expiry of a year-long bail term. ""I hope I can travel. This is an important part of freedom. This is also a human right."" A year after he was freed from unofficial detention, the outspoken 55-year-old artist, who has become a thorn in the side of the Chinese government, clearly chafes at the continuing restrictions on his freedom. In an interview with AFP at his studio in Beijing Ai, who spent 81 days in custody last year, described his frustration at the ongoing case against him. ""I have a lot of art activities, design and construction in the next one or two years which will be overseas because they are not permitted domestically. Limiting me from leaving China will influence these events."" Ai was detained last year as police rounded up activists amid online calls for Arab Spring-style protests in China. On his release on June 22, 2011, authorities accused him of tax evasion and barred him from leaving Beijing for a year -- a restriction that has prevented him from attending a number of his own exhibitions. Ai has just missed an opening at London's Serpentine Gallery for a pavilion with a floating platform roof and an interior clad in cork which he co-designed by communicating on Skype. He had hoped to attend an October show at the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington and take up an invitation to teach in Berlin. But last Thursday police told him that unresolved cases involving accusations of spreading pornography, practising bigamy and conducting illegal foreign exchange transactions supported the overseas travel ban. ""These three things are just an excuse not to give me the right to go outside China,"" he said. The pornography charges stem from what he called a joke after he challenged two groups of visitors to take nude photos with him, which were posted online. He is married, but had a relationship with another woman -- cited by authorities as bigamy -- with whom he had a child, and officials have threatened they could detain him again. ""They are used to doing things this way,"" said Ai, who is technically allowed to travel within China outside his home city of Beijing, but whose passport is being held by authorities. He described the move as revenge against him, but said it would also hurt China which is seeking to build soft power through spreading culture abroad. ""China's policy has always emphasised soft power. This will stop China's cultural exchanges and projects,"" he said. Ai has previously riled the ruling Communist Party with high-profile investigations into the collapse of schools in the 2008 Sichuan earthquake and into a 2010 fire at a Shanghai high-rise that killed dozens of people. Shanghai later demolished Ai's newly built studio in the commercial hub and he was beaten by police in Sichuan after he tried to testify on behalf of another activist who investigated the school issue. Ai said his desire to travel overseas did not necessarily mean he would choose a life in exile, like many other Chinese dissidents. ""This is not to say I must leave China,"" he said. Asked about the case of blind activist Chen Guangcheng, who left for the United States to study in May after taking refuge in the US embassy, Ai replied: ""I don't like the US embassy because the structure is too ugly,"" referring to the fortress-like compound in Beijing. He is now challenging the tax evasion charges and a multi-million-dollar penalty brought against Beijing Fake Cultural Development Ltd., a company he set up but which is registered in his wife's name. A court hearing last week lasted more than nine hours and a ruling is expected by early August. Ai compared the court fight to how Chinese authorities reportedly used to charge the families of executed criminals for the bullets. ""It doesn't matter how wrong they are, they put all the cost on you -- cost of money, cost of energy, passion and your will. It's wasted because you cannot deal with this big machine."" He hopes for change, but he questions how much his activism has been able to accomplish. ""According to logic, there should be change because this society has already reached a time when it must change,"" he said. But he added: ""It's like (being) against the wall. I have raised consciousness, that's all."""

This handout undated picture by the Child Exploitation and Online Protection (CEOP) Centre shows a police officer tracking information on the Internet. Police have arrested 190 individuals, and identified and rescued 18 children, in a major crackdown on child pornography last month, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement said Friday.	 Most of the arrests in Operation Orion through the month of May took place in the United States, but suspects were also picked up in Argentina, Britain, the Philippines and Spain. ""Many of the child exploitation cases under Operation Orion began with a child or teen chatting with someone he or she met online,"" said Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Director John Morton. ""Let this operation be a warning to anyone who would think they can use the Internet to exploit children: we are out there looking for you, we will find you, and you will be prosecuted,"" he added in a statement. Operation Orion targeted individuals ""who possessed, received, transported, distributed, advertised or produced images or videos of child pornography,"" the ICE statement said. Among those arrested was a 35-year-old individual in Louisiana suspected of using the seven-year-old he babysat to make child pornography, and a 35-year-old in Oklahoma who offered money for sex to a 14-year-old victim he met on a social networking site. In Michigan, a 54-year-old allegedly persuaded an underage boy to join him in illegal sexual conduct that he then photographed, while a 28-year-old was found to have more than 1,200 images and 109 videos of suspected child pornography on computers and media storage devices. In Los Angeles eight men were arrested, including one who met his alleged 12-year-old victim on Facebook, and who was detained after agents from ICE's Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) section pretended to be her online. Theodore Perez, 29, was arrested on May 1 when he arrived at a shopping mall to meet a 12-year-old girl he met on Facebook. ""In text messages and telephone conversations with undercover HSI agents who had assumed the girl's identity, Perez allegedly indicated he wanted to commit multiple lewd acts with the child,"" it said. Perez was charged with enticing a minor to commit lewd acts and is being held on $100,000 bond. No details of the arrests conducted overseas were disclosed. ICE said they included some in Argentina, Britain, the Philippines and Spain, In a separate operation announced by prosecutors in Indiana, nine people were prosecuted following the dismantling of an international child pornography ring which also pursued suspects in Sweden, Serbia and the Netherlands. ""Defendants ... have been referred to federal prosecutors and law enforcement in other districts across the country and around the world,"" said US Attorney for the southern district of Indiana Joseph Hogsett. ""This operation uncovered a dangerous and depraved group of criminals who were devoted to trading sexually explicit images of children under the age of five,"" added Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer in a statement issued by the Department of Justice (DoJ) about Operation Bulldog. For the Operation Orion, the ICE director said the arrests, and the timing, could be a good opportunity to warn children about the dangers of online predators. ""With the advent of summer vacation, children may have more time and access to the Internet, making this a good time to talk to them about online dangers,"" said Morton. ICE is part of the Department of Homeland Security, which in the fiscal year ended September 30 initiated more than 3,000 cases into child exploitation and made 1,455 arrests. In that same year, the HSI computer forensics program examined the equivalent of 16.5 million filing cabinets of data related to child exploitation cases."

PayPal on Tuesday reversed a ban on the use of the online payments service for sales of electronic books portraying rape, incest and bestiality.	 Anuj Nayar, director of communications for PayPal, which is owned by online auction giant eBay, announced the change of policy in a blog post on the PayPal website. Nayar said PayPal would limit the sales ban to digital books that contain ""potentially illegal images, not e-books that are limited to just text."" ""The policy will prohibit use of PayPal for the sale of e-books that contain child pornography, or e-books with text and obscene images of rape, bestiality or incest,"" he said. ""In addition, the policy will be focused on individual books, not on entire 'classes' of books,"" Nayar said. ""Instead of demanding that e-book publishers remove all books in a category, we will provide notice to the seller of the specific e-books, if any, that we believe violate our policy,"" he said. Nayar said PayPal was working with e-book publishers to come up with an appeals process for authors whose books are judged to violate the policy. ""Our primary interest in this matter has always been to come to a mutually agreeable solution that allows freedom of expression, while still ensuring PayPal is used in ways that fully comply with applicable laws and our policies,"" he said. The Washington-based Center for Democracy & Technology (CDT) welcomed PayPal's decision. ""We're thankful to PayPal for taking the objections of authors, booksellers and free speech advocates seriously and wisely choosing to change course,"" said Kevin Bankston, director of free expression at the CDT. ""With this policy change, PayPal is correcting a serious mistake and setting a good example for the future,"" Bankston said in a statement. ""PayPal's previous threats to cut off services to e-book platforms unless they stopped selling broad categories of erotic fiction was a major misstep,"" he said. ""By limiting its policy to pictures rather than text and to specific books rather than whole categories of content...

The local digital content and ebook market are expected to surge by five- to 10-fold from 200 million baht in 2011 to 1-2 billion baht this year. The government plans to distribute at least 2 million Chinese-made tablets to primary-school students. Some 900,000 units will be handed over to Prathom 1 pupils in mid-May, with 540,000 more to be handed over next year. Some 638,000 will also be given to Mathayom 1 students next year. With such a large chunk of the tablet user base being school children, some are expecting the project will carve out a new ""educational tablet"" market segment. It is also putting increasing pressure on international computer makers to lower their prices, with some considering jumping into the low-cost educational tablet market. Nitat Maneesilasan, managing director of Openserve (Thailand), a leading ebook service provider, said the state's tablet project has increasingly prompted publishers to produce more digital textbooks. ""We expect the local ebook market to top 1 billion baht in value this year, up from 200 million last year,"" he said, adding that the market may double each year until 2017. Pathom Indarodom, the general manager of ARIP Plc, organiser of the IT fair Commart Thailand, said the state's tablet scheme will speed up the growth of local digital content, worth an estimated at 2 billion baht this year Excluding the government's tablet project, the number of tablet shipments would double to 1 million units this year. Mr Pathom urged the government to promote the development of local educational content and mobile applications to serve the anticipated increase in demand. Sukritta Phatcharasinat, an educational innovation executive of Aun-I-Luck Production Ltd, a local book publisher, said the company is developing learning aid content tailored for tablets in a bundling concept. She said tablets have now become another learning device thanks to rapid technology development. Ms Sukritta also said the government's policy of shifting from traditional textbooks to digital content is halving textbook prices. But digital right management and payment collection methods are the major concerns of the digital book business. Chalermpol Punnotok, acting director of Software Industry Promotion Agency (SIPA), which is a part of the Information and Communication Technology Ministry, said the agency spent 20 million baht on the Edu-tablet architecture 1.0 project to support Thai developers in building their own software development tools for this planned tablet project. The tools cover open-source conversion, authoring tools and Playware, which facilitate experts in developing educational content more easily. The project will also cover security software that controls and filters inappropriate content such as pornography and gambling. In the long run, Mr Chalermpol said the project would provide scoring software that evaluates students' testing scores, making ranking or rating popular mobile educational content possible. Attaphon Satid-kanitkul, research manager of IDC (Thailand), a global IT research firm, said the government's tablet project is expected to stimulate the tablet demand for a short term. A sustainable demand might depend on the quality of both the device and the content. ""The state needs to get a proof of success on its tablet project within two years, or it will repeat the failure of low-cost PC initiated by former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra's government,"" said Mr Attaphon. Phatcharapong Kusuwan, chief operation officer of Click Connect, a Thai mobile developer, said the state's tablet project is also likely to spark other students' interest in educational tablets. This will create a huge opportunity for Thai-language mobile content and applications, both bundled and through download service. Previously, local content providers found it hard to make money from developing content as people were unwilling to pay. Developers needed to sell applications through Apple's App Store or Android's Play Store.He said Click plans to introduce its educational applications for Prathom 1 students in May. ""We expect the overall digital content market growth will double this year,"" Mr Phatcharapong added. In terms of hardware, Apple Inc was in talks with the Office of the Basic Education Commission to introduce a pilot project by providing its iPad for use at schools, aiming to increase the number of users in the educational area. Samsung of South Korea also announced a plan to introduce low-price tablets at 7,900 baht a unit next year to capitalise on increasing demand for educational tablets. But Samsung has no policy to compete with the low-price Chinese-made products, said Pavich Vasanasomsomboon, product marketing manager of Thai Samsung Electronics. The SET-listed Forth Corporation will launch its first Thai-made tablets by June, priced at 5,000 baht, competing directly with Chinese products. Sawat Erbchokchai, Forth's R&D director, conceded that the prices of Forth's tablets may not be as low as Chinese-made ones because they use leading US-made processors _ on par with Samsung and other international tablet makers. Accharas Ouysinprasert, the country manager of Intel Microelectronics (Thailand), a US-based chip maker, said the company has signed a three-month pilot project with the Education Ministry to demonstrate a ""prototype classroom"", allowing students at Samsen Kindergarten school to use its Intel-based tablets.

The ministers from the ruling right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) were filmed by television cameras watching graphic footage on their mobile phones on Tuesday while other lawmakers in the house were debating legislation. In the footage, the ministers were seen watching a woman dancing, undressing and then engaging in a sexual act. They passed their mobile phones amongst themselves. ""We have resigned to avoid embarrassment to our party and not give the opposition an opportunity to disrupt the assembly proceedings today,"" state minister for cooperation Laxman Savadi told reporters. ""We were watching a clipping of an incident for a discussion on the rave parties held at St. Mary's Island (on the western coast of Karnataka). It was not a porn clip."" Karnataka's minister for women and child development, C.C. Patil, and the minister for ports and fishery Krishna Palemar also stepped down. ""It's a shameless act. The three ministers have submitted their resignation. We will set up an inquiry committee to probe the incident,"" said BJP spokeswoman Nirmala Sitharaman in New Delhi. A survey by India Today magazine conducted in 2008 in Indian cities found that three out of five men and one out of five women approved of pornography, which is illegal but widely available in India. The incident is the latest embarrassment to hit the Hindu nationalist BJP. An ombudsman investigating corrupt mining practices reported last year that illegal mining fraud had cost the Karnataka state and federal exchequers $3.6 billion. After the scandal broke B.S. Yeddyurappa, the chief minister of Karnataka, had to resign and was arrested on graft accusations. He is now free on bail. Yeddyurappa also faces allegations of selling government land at below market cost to family members. Reacting to the sex video incident, a leader of the national ruling Congress party, Kapil Sibal, who is also telecom minister, said the BJP should ""introspect"" before they preach morality in public life. In 2009, young activists from the radical Vishwa Hindu Parishad, or World Hindu Council, which has close ties with the BJP, attacked women in a fashionable bar, accusing them of ""debauched behaviour"" for drinking and smoking."

A file picture from 2009 shows Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolay Patrushev. Patrushev said use of the Internet by criminals and terrorist groups cannot be ignored ""Attempts to stop people communicating are in principle counterproductive and even immoral. But we cannot ignore the use of the Internet by criminals and terrorist groups,"" Russia's Security Council chief Nikolai Patrushev said in an interview with Argumenty i Fakty newspaper. ""Of course there should be reasonable regulation in Russia, just as it is done in the United States, China and many other countries."" The Internet has become a vital resource in Russia to coordinate protests, including a rally that drew tens of thousands of people at the weekend disputing parliamentary polls won by Vladimir Putin's ruling party. Rights activist Lev Ponomaryov linked Patrushev's proposal to the protests, warning a crackdown on the Internet would only provoke more public anger ahead of a new mass opposition rally planned this month. ""It's very significant that such proposals are being voiced after the mass rally in Moscow and ahead of another protest planned for December 24,"" Ponomaryov of For Human Rights movement told the Interfax news agency. Restrictions on Internet freedoms would ""provoke additional tensions in society,"" he said. Russia in September became the European country with the largest number of Internet users, according to Comscore ratings agency, and the use of blogs and social networking sites has boomed in recent years. Yet reflecting official fears, an FSB-backed campaign group called the Safe Internet League on Wednesday presented draft amendments to block sites with child pornography or promoting drugs and extremism. The group's board of supervisors includes the FSB's head of information security, according to its website. Experts said the problem was in defining terms such as 'extremism'. ""This is a threat to our individual liberties and a return to the Soviet Union. Our media is already censored. They should keep their hands off the Internet. Who decides what is extremist?"" said popular blogger Alexander Plyushev. Blocking websites deemed extremist ""runs contrary to the Constitution, which bans censorship and guarantees the privacy of correspondence,"" said Irina Levova of the Russian Association of Electronic Communications. There are already signs the authorities are blocking opposition websites. Independent media and an election monitor group have complained that their websites were subjected to hacker attacks ahead of the protests. Experts also tracked streams of automatic messages posted on Twitter to trick people searching for information on rallies. And the head of the VKontakte, Russia's most popular social networking site, wrote on his blog last week that prosecutors had called him in for questioning after he refused to deny access to a number of opposition groups.

The online ""hacktivist"" group Anonymous claimed on Wednesday to have published the Internet Protocol addresses of nearly 200 visitors to child pornography forums. In a statement posted to pastebin.com, Anonymous said it was exposing the IP addresses as part of a campaign dubbed ""Operation Darknet."" An IP address is the unique number used by every device that connects to the Internet. Most of the IP addresses of visitors to child porn sites exposed by Anonymous were in the United States but some were located in Europe, Latin America and elsewhere. Anonymous said it captured the IP addresses of visitors to child porn forums by tricking users into downloading a fake update to Tor software, which can be used to obscure an Internet user's identity. The purported Tor update actually routed traffic to a forensics server controlled by Anonymous that logged incoming IP addresses and destination. During a 24-hour period last week, Anonymous said it captured the unique IP addresses of 190 visitors to child porn forums. Anonymous has been involved in scores of hacking exploits including the recent defacing of a website of Syria's Ministry of Defense to protest a bloody crackdown on anti-government protestors. Last year, the shadowy group launched retaliatory attacks on companies perceived to be enemies of the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks."

People surf the Internet at a coffee shop in Beijing. British Foreign Secretary William Hague has issued a warning to countries that try to restrict Internet freedom as he opened a global conference designed to set up cyberspace ""rules of the road"".	 Government officials, tech firms, NGOs, bloggers and security experts from more than 60 countries attended the two-day talks in London, and US Vice President Joe Biden also gave an address via video-link from Washington. In his opening speech to delegates including officials from Russia and China, Hague said the social and economic benefits of the Internet were huge and warned that any states trying to block online activity would lose out. ""We must aspire to a future for cyberspace which is not stifled by government control or censorship, but where innovation and competition flourish and investment and enterprise are rewarded,"" the foreign secretary said. Hague warned that human rights, particularly the right to privacy and freedom of expression, ""should carry full force online"". ""We reject the view that government suppression of the Internet, phone networks and social media at times of unrest is acceptable,"" he said. Biden echoed Hague, saying that while the Internet presented opportunities for wrongdoing ""on a vast scale"" from terrorism to human trafficking, child pornography to attacks on government systems, they were no excuse for censorship. ""In our quest for security, we believe that we cannot sacrifice the openness that makes possible all the benefits and opportunities that the Internet brings,"" he said, standing in for US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton who had to cancel due to the illness of her mother, who later died. He added: ""Those countries that try to have it both ways by making the Internet closed to freedom of expression but open for business will find that this is no easy task."" Although both men were referring to crackdowns in the Middle East and North Africa and efforts by countries such as China and Russia to control the flow of information, Britain faces accusations of hypocrisy. In August, when rioting broke out across English cities, Prime Minister David Cameron had mooted the idea of stopping rioters communicating via social media, although the government did not take it any further. John Kampfner, chief executive of Index on Censorship, highlighted this at a side meeting at the conference, saying: ""It's very easy to defend this case of black and white human rights against dictatorships around the world. ""But as soon as our own western-style stability of the state is called into question, well then freedom of expression is expendable. There should be one rule for all including western governments."" He said Hague had challenged Cameron on his stance at the time, and in his brief address to the conference on Tuesday, the prime minister insisted it was important to ""strike a balance... between freedom and a free-for-all"". William Echikson, Google's head of free expression in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa, also warned at the conference that Western governments were not immune from wanting to control the Internet. Freedom of expression ""is being challenged closer to home here in Europe. There are some 60 countries which impose controls now on the Internet, and that's up from two a decade ago,"" Echikson said. He cited a case last year when three Google Italy executives were convicted of violation of privacy over an Internet video of bullying, adding: ""The dangers are really here in the present and they are threatening companies like Google."" The London talks cover a broad agenda including cyber security, and Hague said it would aim to set up some basic global principles for cyberspace. ""In the place of today's cyber free-for-all, we need rules of the road,"" he said, adding that Hungary had agreed to hold a follow-on conference in 2012, and South Korea would hold another similar meeting in 2013."

Attorney General Eric Holder speaks about an international child pronography investigation during a news conference at the Justice Department in Washington, DC. US officials Wednesday unveiled charges against 72 people in their largest global probe into Internet child pornography which smashed a ""nightmare"" online bulletin board catering to pedophiles. The investigation launched in 2009 has led to arrests in the US and 13 other countries of participants in Dreamboard, which had a ""VIP"" ranking system for members trading in graphic images and videos of adults molesting children age 12 and under, often violently, the Justice Department said. ""Dreamboard's creators and members lived all over the world -- but they allegedly were united by a disturbing belief that the sexual abuse of children is proper conduct that should not be criminalized,"" Attorney General Eric Holder said. ""The members of this criminal network shared a demented dream to create the preeminent online community for the promotion of child sexual exploitation, but for the children they victimized, this was nothing short of a nightmare."" The ongoing probe has led to the arrest of 52 people in the US and 13 other countries -- Canada, Denmark, Ecuador, France, Germany, Hungary, Kenya, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Qatar, Serbia, Sweden and Switzerland. Thirteen of the 52 individuals arrested have pleaded guilty, and 20 of the 72 individuals charged ""remain at large and are known only by their online identities,"" a Justice Department statement said. Operation Delego ""represents the largest prosecution to date in the United States of individuals who participated in an online bulletin board conceived and operated for the sole purpose of promoting child sexual abuse, disseminating child pornography and evading law enforcement,"" it said. ""Dreamboard was a self-described global 'community' of pedophiles dedicated to the relentless victimization and exploitation of children 12 and under,"" said Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer. According to the Justice Department, membership was tightly controlled by the site's administrators, who required prospective members to upload child pornography when applying for membership. Members were then required continually to upload images of child sexual abuse in order to keep up their membership in the board, which included rules of conduct printed in English, Russian, Japanese and Spanish. Some of the children featured in the images and videos were just babies, said Holder. ""And, in many cases, the children being victimized were in obvious, and intentional, pain -- even 'in distress and crying,' just as the rules for one area of the bulletin board mandated,"" he added. All 72 of the defendants are charged with conspiring to advertise and distribute child pornography, and 50 are also charged with engaging in a child pornography enterprise. ""Dreamboard members allegedly used the power and anonymity of the Internet to motivate each other to commit their horrific acts of sexual abuse of minors and trading in child pornography,"" Breuer said. According to court documents, members employed a variety of methods to conceal their activities, using ""screen names"" and proxy servers, which can be used to reroute web traffic and disguise a user's actual location. Dreamboard members also encouraged the use of encryption programs on their computers, which password-protect computer files to prevent law enforcement from accessing them in the event of a court-authorized search. Officials said the charges and arrests were conducted in three separate phases over the course of the operation. Four of the 13 individuals who have pleaded guilty for their roles in the conspiracy have been sentenced to prison. On May 10, Timothy Lee Gentry, 33, of Burlington, Kentucky, was sentenced to 25 years in prison; on May 31, Michael Biggs, 32, of Orlando, Florida, was sentenced to 20 years; on June 22, Michael Childs, 49, of Huntsville, Alabama, was sentenced to 30 years; and on July 14, Charles Christian, 49, of Tilton, Illinois, was sentenced to more than 22 years in prison. Operation Delego was conducted by the Justice Department with Homeland Security's Immigration and Customs Enforcement, along with other global law enforcement agencies including Eurojust, the European Union's Judicial Cooperation Unit and ""dozens of law enforcement agencies throughout the world,"" the statement said."

A US man who hacked into his neighbors' Wi-Fi network and tried to frame them with child pornography and threatening emails to the US vice president has been sentenced to 18 years in jail.	 US District Judge Donovan Frank sentenced Barry Ardolf, 46, on Tuesday after listening to the tearful testimony of Bethany Kostolnik, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported. ""My husband and I had to explain to our young, innocent children way too early that there are evil people in the world -- and to never go in Barry Ardolf's yard,"" she said, according to the newspaper. ""Until Ardolf was incarcerated, not a day went by that I didn't think about another attack,"" her husband Matt Kostolnik said. ""Barry Ardolf has demonstrated by his conduct that he is a dangerous man,"" US attorneys prosecuting the case said in court documents. ""When he became angry at his neighbors, he vented his anger in a bizarre and calculated campaign of terror against them."" The trouble began in August 2008 when the Kostolniks, who had just moved into the neighborhood, reported Ardolf to police after he picked up their four-year-old son and kissed him on the mouth, according to US attorneys. Ardolf then began exacting revenge by hacking into their Wi-Fi network and creating fake email addresses, which he used to send crude messages and child pornography to Matt Kostolnik's co-workers and boss, the prosecution said. After Ardolf sent threatening emails in Kostolnik's name to Vice President Joe Biden and others, investigators discovered the hacking following a search of Ardolf's home in the summer of 2009. Ardolf initially arranged a plea deal that would have had him serve two to five years in prison, but later backed out of it and fired his attorney. In December Ardolf again pleaded guilty before changing his mind and trying to arrange another deal, but the prosecuting US attorney held him to the plea."

""This is a problem that is global in nature,"" Allen said. ""We think with Facebook we will be able to identify perpetrators preying on kids all over the world."" The California-based social networking service is reported to have more than 600 million members around the planet. ""Facebook is becoming a model for the entire Internet industry,"" Allen said, who expressed hope that pressure would be put on other online services to employ the child-porn-detecting technology. PhotoDNA will also be scouring Facebook uploads for pictures of children reported missing, since youths tend to stay connected with friends at the social network even if they are dodging family, according to police. ""Facebook joining us is just a fantastic step forward,"" Harmon said in the webcast. ""We plan to keep deploying and hope more partners and make this really big and help children in a large way."" Each month Facebook users share more than 30 billion pieces of content including pictures, news stories, blog posts, and Web links, according to Microsoft.

Some 7.5 million of the 20 million minors who used Facebook in the past year were younger than 13, and a million of them were bullied, harassed or threatened on the site, says a study released Tuesday.	 More than five million Facebook users were 10 years old or younger, and they were allowed to use Facebook largely without parental supervision, leaving them vulnerable to threats ranging from malware to identity theft to sexual predators, the State of the Net survey by Consumer Reports said. Facebook's terms of service require users to be at least 13 years old but many children, or their parents, get around that rule by giving a false birth date when they sign up for the social networking site. Parents of kids 10 and younger who use Facebook ""seem to be largely unconcerned"" by their children's use of the site, possibly because they think a young child is less vulnerable to Internet risks, the study said. But while a 10-year-old might not download pornography on the Internet, he or she does ""need protection from other hazards that might lurk on the Internet, such as links that infect their computer with malware and invitations from strangers, not to mention bullies,"" the study said. More than five million US households have been exposed in the past year to ""some type of abuse"" via Facebook, including virus infections, identity theft and bullying, said the study, for which 2,089 US households were interviewed earlier this year. A separate study published last month by Richard Power of Carnegie Mellon University's CyLab cybersecurity research center, found that 10 percent of children in the United States have had their social security numbers stolen and used to apply for driver's licenses and loans to buy cars or even houses. The rate of identity theft among children was 51 times higher than for adults, Power said in his study. ""The online experience has changed childhood, for both better and worse. ""It enables children to explore the life of the world, but without proper precautions, it also enables the world to explore your child?s life,"" he said. A news story quoted in the CyLab study said a group of teens was contacted on Facebook by a fake talent scout ""promising them a career as a model in exchange for photos of themselves in lingerie."" Consumer Reports urged parents to delete their pre-teens' Facebook accounts -- or ask Facebook to do so by using the site's ""report an underage child"" form -- and to monitor teenage kids' accounts by friending them or keeping an eye on their activity via siblings' or friends' Facebook pages. It also called on Facebook to ""beef up its screening to drastically reduce the number of underage members."" Facebook spokesman Andrew Noyes said in a statement sent to AFP that the social networking site encourages ""communication between parents/guardians and kids about their use of the Internet. ""Just as parents are always teaching and reminding kids how to cross the road safely, talking about Internet safety should be just as important a lesson to learn,"" Noyes said. But he also stressed ""just how difficult it is to implement age restrictions on the Internet"" and said there is ""no single solution to ensuring younger children don't circumvent a system or lie about their age."""

It's one of those things that takes forever to build yet can be destroyed all too easily. The question is simple, given what happened in India, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates - do you still trust your BlackBerry? On Oct 8, it was reported that the Research In Motion (RIM), makers of the ubiquitous BlackBerry, had averted a ban because it had managed to comply with the necessary telecommunications regulatory framework in the UAE. No details were forthcoming from RIM, but is is understood that the UAE, along with other countries mentioned, now has access to encrypted BlackBerry messaging communications. Encryption, like most major advances in the history of mankind, is a double-edged sword. Some say that since guns kill, society should outlaw guns. Others argue that in that case, only the outlaws will have guns. But what of taking that argument to encryption, which is essentially what the BlackBerry affair is all about. True, encryption can be used by terrorists and paedophiles, but it can also be used by merchants to take credit card payments securely and enable e-commerce. But unlike guns that kill people (or people who use guns to kill people) and leave dead bodies, information theft is different in that nothing actually goes missing and the information can be used to change decisions in a way that can never be proven; subtle changes that can be worth millions or billions. I remember a story by a former big company analyst who was posted in the Philippines and learned Tagalog - not that anyone knew he spoke the language. He was able to listen in and know exactly where his clients stood in terms of pricing and concerns and thus negotiate consultancy contracts with great success. Just think, hypothetically, how much money would peeking into the BlackBerries of the various telco bosses have been worth to the regulator, our beloved NTC, in the run-up to the aborted 3G auction. Or, for that matter, how much peeking into the BlackBerries of the NTC be worth to the telco bosses trying to participate in (or, in one case, derail) the auction. Not that any of that happened, of course. Thailand is much too civilised to stoop that low. Many years ago in the UK there was a fierce debate raging about whether to allow wiretapping evidence in court. One side said that not allowing it in court was an anachronism and that times and technology had moved on. The other side said that the system worked well enough already. The courts could allow police to wiretap suspects and the investigators would then build up a case based on that information from the interception of communication without ever needing that actual intercepted messages to be used as evidence. Pandora's box has more. Is it just the BlackBerry Internet Service (BIS) that is affected? What of the BlackBerry Enterprise Server? What of roaming? What of multinationals? If it is only the consumer-grade BIS that is affected, a terrorist cell could easily set up its own BlackBerry Enterprise Server. If the country in question intercepted encrypted traffic to and from the BES too, where would that leave multinationals who do business and communicate based on the premise of secure messaging? If their messaging platform is not secure, they cannot operate for fear of breaching half a dozen compliance rules and regulations and landing their CIO in jail. What, then, of roaming? Not intercepting roaming messages would mean that the terrorists and paedophile could communicate in-country via overseas phones. Intercepting roaming messages would mean an end to BlackBerry security unless the compromised countries are named and ticked off, which would cause further diplomatic uproar. That is not as far fetched as it may seem. Even today, in Thailand, where too many issues of The Economist are banned, workers in most multinationals can still access those banned copies, as well as any number of banned websites. Their network is usually a virtual private network (VPN) that accesses the Internet only through a gateway in their headquarters in Silicon Valley, or wherever they are based. This is for security, for compliance. Their IT security department needs to see if any trade secrets, credit card numbers, patient records or any other relevant information is leaked, not because they want to out of the kindness of their heart, but because they have to by law. Perhaps it will be the little people whose privacy is sacrificed in the name of anti-terrorism and that the big companies will keep their privacy via threat to withdraw investment if they are questioned. RIM never went into detail about what deals were struck with those governments. A pity. People have a choice. We can hope that BlackBerry remains secure in Thailand, or we can take matters into our own hands. Android phones have a program called APG that does end-to-end PGP (pretty good privacy) encryption. It can be integrated with the K9-Mail client. No, it is not easy to use and is clunky compared to the slickness of the BlackBerry, but it is secure. People using it in India, Saudi Arabia and the UAE (and Thailand) can be certain that their messages on APG/K-9 cannot be eavesdropped on by their government. However, as few people use encrypted email, it also means that the first user will stick out like a sore thumb. PGP grants privacy but not anonymity. The governments can still see who you communicate with, just not what you are saying. And therein lies another problem. If peer-to-peer encryption (as opposed to centralised encryption) is too good, then bad guys can get away with anything unless there is a law that forces people to give up their password. The Thai cyber crime law has one, as does the UK's Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act. Recently a British teenager was sentenced to four months in jail for refusing to give up his password after his computers were seized on suspicion of paedophilia. It may never be known if the hard drive did contain child pornography. Four months for forgetting a password is much less time in jail that the alternative had he given up his password and found to have had the illegal material. Increasing the penalty would destroy the premise of innocent until proven guilty and effectively make privacy a severe crime. Not doing so means the penalty for any cyber crime pulled off properly is just four months. One wonders how Thailand will stand on this issue. One wonders what decisions have already been made behind our backs."

Without porn driving growth and web technologies (picture formats, file-sharing, and so on), the Internet probably wouldn't be what it is today. In the early days, trading pornographic pictures occupied much of the Internet's time and effort. Even before the Internet, there were BBSs full of porn for the downloading. Web searches for porn bring up hundreds of millions of results—more hits than looking for ‘god’. The folks at onlinemba.com recently posted a full-page graphic detailing the latest statistics on Internet porn, showing that it is not quite as popular as it used to be, if only because so much information is now available to Internet users. Even so, the statistics speak for themselves. According to OnlineMBA: - 12 per cent of all the sites on the Internet are pornographic in nature, accounting for more than 25 million sites; - $3,075.64 (96,698.50 baht) is spent on Internet porn every second and there are 28,258 users looking at porn every second; - bout a third of porn viewers are women; - 2.5 billion emails each day are pornographic in nature. - Most children are first exposed to Internet porn at age 11. To see the full report, point your browser to http://www.onlinemba.com/blog/the-stats-on-internet-pornography/. More statistics: a Google search for ""porn"" turns up 215 million hits. A search for ""sex""turns up 621 million hits. By way of contrast, a search for ""god"" turned up 378 million hits. The pornography industry, according to the Top 10 Reviews web site, makes more money than Microsoft, Google, Amazon, eBay, Yahoo, Apple and Netflix combined. In 2006, revenues were reported at $97 billion (3.05 trillion baht). Every 39 minutes in the US, another porn video is being created. I would be hesitant about imposing any controls on Internet porn. Controlling access to information, of whatever kind, is a thing of the past, when leaders and elites tried desperately to impose their own values and points of view on the huddling masses. That will no longer do. If given a choice, I would much rather my child was looking at Internet porn than watching a Friday the 13th-type movie. Watching people do the rumpy-pumpy can't be nearly as traumatic as watching a mad man hack hapless teenagers to death. One is really rather normal, part of life, while the other is unnatural and rightfully disturbing. Curiosity about sex, and the opposite sex, or the same sex as the case may be, is quite natural, especially for young people, and they will always find a way to indulge that curiosity. For myself, growing up in the 1970s, it was looking at Playboy magazine. As long as people are not being exploited, it matters little to me what others choose to do with themselves and their sexuality. Efforts to legislate such matters betray an inability to deal with the facts of life. The world is what it is, and there are far more important matters that one could legislate than Internet porn. Which is not to say I approve of Internet porn. But ""approve"" is the wrong word altogether. I do not approve of many things, merely acknowledge their existence. Life is what it is, warts and all. Sex is part of life, indeed an essential part. Without sex, none of us would be here. Biologists suggest that the pleasure of sex ensures that the younger generations will keep at it, replenishing the species in the process. The Internet has gotten better at hiding porn. There was a time when porn ads were thrown in your face - it was called getting stuck in a ""porn cycle"". When one tried to read Newsgroups (no longer as popular now as they once were), the entries were full of ads for porn and porn sites, even pornographic pictures. Spammers managed to fill your inbox with all sorts of nonsense, so much so that it was sometimes embarrassing to read your own email. Things have improved immeasurably. The popular webmail sites, like Gmail and Yahoo! Mail, have introduced automatic filters to remove most of the unwanted junk (porn or otherwise) so that you never see it (unless you click on the ""Spam"" or ""Trash"" folders and go looking for it). Years ago, after a flurry of hysteria about child porn, I did a bit of research and tried to see if this was as readily available as the reports indicated. My search was rather half-hearted, fearful as I was that the Internet police would arrest me and haul me off to the clink. I looked around enough to realise that the Internet was not swamped in child porn, but one had to dig rather deep to find it. The average user was not going to stumble across it while looking for cake recipes. For the purposes of this article, I did another Google search for ""child porn"" that demonstrated a lot of progress on this front. Most of the hits were related to news articles about child pornography or YouTube videos on why child porn is wrong. Even a Google search under the ""Images"" tab turned up nothing that could be considered illegal. One problem in this area, and just as an aside, is kids themselves using technologies like the Internet and cellphone cameras to take pictures or videos of themselves (or others) in the buff, and then posting them online. Sometimes this is done just for fun. Folks at places like YouTube have been vigilant in removing such postings - but not always. So while Internet porn is just as strong as ever, it has fallen into the background, like those adult bookstores I used to see in seedy neighbourhoods. Still there, still available, but not quite so in your face. And whether you approve of porn or not, one must acknowledge the debt the Internet owes to its lustier inhabitants. If the Internet gods continue to police themselves and keep porn out of the mainstream (and get rid of child porn and any other type of porn that hurts or exploits others), this will continue to be the non-issue it is. Parents who are worried about the issue should investigate software options like NetNanny, which do a good job of keeping young users away from porn sites.

											Censorship versus security										",https://search.bangkokpost.com/track/visitAndRedirect?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bangkokpost.com%2Ftech%2F191592%2Fcensorship-versus-security&contentId=news191592,"Freedom of speech, abuse of power by the government, and the new norms of a democratic society empowered by the Internet were all topics discussed by a wide variety of speakers at a seminar on the third anniversary of the Computer Misuse Act, often known as the Cybercrime law, hosted by the Thai Netizen Network, Media 4 Democracy and the Southeast Asia Press Alliance. Suranand Vejjajiva, former Minister to the Prime Minister's Office and currently a columnist for the Bangkok Post, spoke of how bureaucracy has not realised the world had changed because of the Internet and how education and self-immunity, not control, is the way forward in a democratic society. ""Control is a normal part of corporate culture,"" he said ""If one looks at IBM, Hitachi or Haliburton, all these organisations have a very strong level of control of the flow of information, which is normal. ""However, what is different is the backdrop. In the west, these controls are imposed on a culture that has been built up over many generations accustomed to free speech and democracy, whereas Thailand is a culture where children still grow up told to study hard and go forth to become rulers of people. ""Overseas, you know what is what. There is clarity. In Thailand there are laws like the cyber crime law. What is state security? What is porn? Would Thairath on a Sunday be considered indecent? What is lese majeste? I can't say anything further or else the next time I give a speech it might have to be via a tape from a secret location. Thai laws are unclear. The State of Emergency law gives even more power for control. ""In Thailand, print media has fought and won a lot. Lobbying is normal practice. I don't believe that people in the White House do not lobby the New York Times or call or even threaten them. It depends on how strong the media is and the morals of the politicians and the bureaucracy,"" Suranand continued. ""TV and radio have their own problems, as they are owned by the state and run under concession. ""But the Internet is different. The social norms have had decades to adjust to print media before the age of TV but the organisations, the bureaucracy do not understand how the world has changed. From a medium that only a select few people own to something citizen groups or NGOs influence, the Internet belongs to everyone. Everyone has the right to post their opinion, to blog, to upload. Suranand Vejjajiva ""Social media is a tool of democracy, but if you use it too much, too much democracy is anarchy and nobody ends up listening to anyone. ""If we had stronger social norms, Thailand would never have had to come up with the cybercrime law. ""You cannot control the new world, not like in the past when governments could shut down a printing press. What is needed is self-immunisation, but that leads into another problem - that Thailand needs education reform. From an early age, children in Thailand are taught to accept authority and that the teacher is always right. ""The computer crime law is too universal. If someone disagrees with child pornography, it should be put into a particular law. If you add everything from human trafficking to drug sales over the Internet, you end up with an umbrella law like the cybercrime law. ""Today, society is self-censoring. When people talk about anything, they first have to check if people are 'red' or 'yellow' and often end up not saying anything. That is a problem as without debate democracy will not function. ""Thailand has this deference to others in power. If a post deemed as unpatriotic, it has to be censored. ""Everyone has to love the King, to love the country the same way,"" added Suranand. ""Now I just talk to my wife. If she were deep yellow, I would be in a lot of trouble."" Suranand was once a member of the Cabinet ministers supposed to be in charge of running the country. However, he says the bureaucracy still has its own way of thinking and ignoring the spirit of the law and acting only on the details that suit it. The Computer Misuse Act is a prime example of bureaucracy ignoring the spirit of the law to protect innocents from cyber criminals and turned it into a tool for political gain. Finally, Suranand said that censorship is like corking a bottle and putting society under pressure. When it explodes, Thailand will have a huge problem. Sarinee Achavanuntakul Sarinee Achavanuntakul, from the Thai Netizen Network, better known as @fringer on Twitter, said the Thai state sees the Internet as another media. Anyone can read Twitter or Facebook, but unlike traditional media, social media does not have an editorial process before it gets published. Social media contributors see social media simply as chatting to friends, only in this case the entire world is looking on. ""But if they would only understand, they would see that social media is naturally conducive to a democratic society,"" she said. The other issue with censorship is that it has a high cost. Not just in terms of money to run a censorship system, but in terms of Internet speed and latency. Apart from being too universal, the Thai cybercrime law is flawed, especially in article 14, that covers anything that might be damaging to national security. ""Might be"" is a very vague term that is open to interpretation and abuse. When people post their expressions on their Facebook or Twitter status, they think they are chatting in their bedroom in private, though in fact the whole world is listening. But is curtailing that freedom to think and reflect then a violation of their human rights? Finally, Sarinee said the biggest damage to society is in terms of lost innovation. How many new services and websites based on user-generated content could Thailand have built if webmasters were not under constant fear of censorship and faced with the high cost of content moderation? Roby Alampay from the South East Asian Press Alliance said the eyes of the world were focused on Thailand as Internet freedom is everybody's problem. Around the world, people accept there is a limit to free speech. There is universal agreement that child pornography is a concern, but then the slippery slope starts on issues of terrorism and security. All around the world, people surrender to their governments the right to decide what is right, what is bad. The slippery slope goes from child pornography to decency and respect and before long, everything online is sensitive. He noted that the same day the Prime Minister was giving a speech on press freedom, the police were knocking down the doors of Prachathai. It is a balance of responsibility and ethics. How do we counter-balance responsibility and freedom. It is impossible to legislate responsibility. By its very definition, that is impossible as if something is legislated then it is not your responsibility. In Southeast Asia there is this instinct that there must be a way to legislate responsibility, which is impossible. Responsibility comes from media literacy and education. Governments try to censor, though they know it is impossible. But in doing so they send a message to intimidate or to suggest and lead the citizen to self-censorship. People will know what is tolerated and what is not, and then can take their own risk. The unfortunate thing is that censorship only succeeds in splintering people into smaller, more radical groups where, after a few iterations, only the most hardcore and technology-savvy people will bother to continue the conversation. It radicalises opinion, from an open forum where everyone was welcome, censorship only serves to divide it up into groups which are angry and intolerant of other views. Ultimately it is no longer is a discussion. The Internet is where taboos are broken and boundaries are being pushed. In Indonesia, it is where sex scandals are broken, for instance. Traditional media often taking a 'wait and see' approach. Alampay said that SEAPA's advocacy for press freedom is based in its confidence in the free market of ideas; of faith and confidence in people. If you allow people to discuss, make mistakes and, to a certain extent, hurt each other with words, ultimately you will have an environment that fosters freedom of expression and an environment of tolerance and ultimately an environment of understanding. ""Censorship used to be in the realm of public figures, writers and film makers. Now you can be censored as a private citizen. You are censoring yourself in your emails. As soon as you have changed and think that way, you have already self-censored,"" he said. Niran Yaowapa, editor of manager.co.th, spoke of how his website was currently being sued by Thaksin Shinawatra under clause 16 of the Computer Misuse Act, better known as the ""Photoshop clause"". Interestingly enough, Thaksin used the computer misuse act to sue Manager as, under normal libel laws, it has been proven time and time again that political parody is not a crime when printed in a newspaper. ""That is the problem with the cyber crime law. Why is something that is legal through traditional media suddenly illegal when done over the Internet?"" he asked. Niran said that when former ICT Minister Professor Sithichai Pokaiudom defended the law to the national legislative assembly, he spoke of the need to protect computer systems from hackers and false information that would damage the economy and society. Why, then, has the law been used primarily to limit freedom of speech? Where are the criminals punished for phishing and hacking? The law was initiated under the Chuan Leekpai government in 1998. The first draft was completed on September 29, 2003 and forwarded to the council of state by the Thaksin cabinet. The council of state finished its review in 2005. Niran said that it was presumed that the law was delayed because of Thaksin Shinawatra's vested business interest in the sector. For whatever reason, after the coup, the draft was then passed by the Surayud Chulanond cabinet less than one month after it was formed and presented to the National Legislative Assembly on November 15, 2006, the first law to be passed by the assembly. The law was passed and on June 18, 2007 it was published in the Royal Gazette and came into force on July 18, 2007. Niran indicated that article 18 of the law gives officials wide-ranging powers to close down computer systems, intercept and wiretap. In the original draft, they had this power outright, but after it was debated in the NLA, checks and balances were added by having to seek a court warrant first. In practice, the courts simply agree with the officers seeking a warrant as they lacked technical knowledge. Niran noted that former NLA member Kamnoon Sidhisamarn argued that the law was too far-reaching and that too much power was given to officials to punish rather than to protect. Jiranuch Premchaiporn, webmaster of the Prachathai webboard, said that she has the distinct honour of being the first to have been arrested and charged under the Computer Misuse Act and is now on bail awaiting a number of trials for comments posted by users of her forum that were not removed quickly enough to satisfy authorities. Prachathai closed its webboard on July 31 as it was impossible, she felt, to comply with the law. Even if every poster had submitted the 13-digit ID number upon registration, there was no way to verify that information and false data could to arresting the wrong person. ""We thought that article 15 - intention - could save us, but it is amazing how intention can be interpreted,"" she said. ""If we can't guarantee freedom of speech, we should not pretend to have it. So we decided to shut down the web board. That is the only reason. No minister ordered me to,"" she said. Now that Prachathai is shut down, Jiranuch said that a lot of underground web boards will take its place and discussion will become even harder to monitor. She said that the ongoing state of emergency had only given officials an excuse not to follow the few checks and balances in the Computer Misuse Act they felt too cumbersome and arrest and seize equipment anyway. ""That is not good for a democratic society,"" she said. Tham Chuasatapanakij from Media Monitor Thailand presented findings of a study of Facebook groups. Out of 1,807 Facebook fan pages, almost 95 percent were anti-Red Shirt and only 3 percent wanted peace without taking sides. ""Krungthep Poll said that 60 percent of people do not want to take sides. The evidence on Facebook does not seem to support that,"" said Tham."

											Looking beyond the letter of the law										",https://search.bangkokpost.com/track/visitAndRedirect?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bangkokpost.com%2Ftech%2F189370%2Flooking-beyond-the-letter-of-the-law&contentId=news189370,"Censorship is something that most of us detest but many more conservative factions seem to feel is a necessary part of modern civil society. The slippery slope, as they call it, starts from an almost universal acceptance of censorship of child pornography to hardcore pornography and so on and so forth, until in a hundred iterations later in some societies, seeing a single stray hair is construed as adultery and is punishable by building a wall to have it collapse on the woman involved. So we try to censor that which society considers immoral, a definition that is decided by the mystic elders appointed by a secret committee. Remember how Cannes' awarding producer Apichatpong Weerasethakul's previous work was censored by the Ministry of Culture? The problem is that censorship does not work on a technological level and ultimately neither does it work on a practical and social level. One chain of investigation has shown that censorship might actually be more effective in protecting and promoting a bad idea rather than quashing it. Over the past few days I have been, in my honest opinion, legally viewing a number of censored web pages. How and where is a matter for another discussion, lest I be charged with an aiding and abetting a crime. Suffice it to say that circumventing the MICT's form of censorship is very easy as long as you are semi-computer literate, which is more than I can say of most of the officials working for Big Brother. Most of the time, the grown up corners of the Internet as we have come to love, FaceBook, YouTube, even Wikipedia or Ebay have their own peer checks and balances built in. If something offensive is put on YouTube, people will soon report it and eventually, if not immediately, it is usually pulled down. The social Internet works because of the intelligence of the crowd that flags and filters things. But add censorship and things get a bit messy. There is one Facebook account that shall not be named. I would love to name and shame him, but if I do so, that might be construed as inviting people to view his account and I would be charged with lese majeste. I would love to quote things that he has said so that police can move in and arrest him, but if I do so, I would be charged with saying so myself and probably spend the next few years defending myself to the DSI and to a secret court somewhere. Therein lies the problem. If you make something so illegal and censor it, how can someone report it? Sondhi Limthongkul did that with Da ""Torpedo"" and her rally speech which called for, for... again I have to stop as though I listened to that speech myself, if I say what she called for, I could myself be charged with lese majeste as Sondhi has been. But back to Facebook. That particular account has some of the nastiest, most distasteful pictures that even non-royalists would object on the grounds of common decency. It includes pictures and videos that range to hard-core porn and bestiality that should in normal circumstances not be on Facebook as it clearly violates their terms and conditions, not to mention a level of language that is highly offensive. The problem is that because the account is clumsily censored by the authorities, normal, decent, people cannot go in and click ""report this picture"" and its subversive operations continue unabated. Telling other people to go in and report that picture could be construed as promoting that offensive material and land that person with criminal charges. Better just to turn the other way and let the authorities (fail to) deal with it. Better erect a somebody else's problem (SEP) field and get on with shopping and eating out at a posh restaurant. Meanwhile, this account's popularity is growing with lots of very red avatars (and many yellow avatars being beheaded or in other compromising positions) on his friends' list. If the government did not censor this account, most of his pictures would have been pulled down now and quite probably the account terminated for its promotion of hate; but no, it has become a vibrant exchange of extremist thinking. The subversion goes further. The account is very active posting to other Thai, pro-royal and pro-PAD Facebook groups, insulting them and taunting them. The government is doing its most to block individual comments on them, but short of blocking Facebook itself, there is nothing it can do. This means that many people who follow up on these taunts see a banned page. Some are curious and go in anyway, around the censorship, and then see the offensive material. By stopping people from reporting the content, censorship only serves to protect them from Facebook's usual peer-to-peer policing. The flip side is that even moderately anti-Red videos can be censored by Facebook. I once tried to send a link to a clip of the riots near General Prem's house via Facebook to a friend's wall and it would not let me, saying that link has been reported by someone as offensive. It was a news clip that was aired on television. Of course, people throwing bricks and having a riot is offensive, but it happened and it is much less offensive than the pictures in that account which cannot be named. One of the most interesting arguments defending censorship I have heard came from former ICT Minister, Prof Sithichai Pokaiudom. He said that censorship was necessary to keep society peaceful and prevent the people of the country from rising up and hunting down the other side to lynch them in a frenzied witch-hunt, or words to that effect. Well, it has been a few years since His Eminence enacted that policy and people still seem ready to hunt down the other, if not with fire and stones, but with rocket-propelled grenades and sniper fire. When some figures in the Democrat party talk of a huge conspiracy out there to undermine and overthrow the monarchy it is easy to dismiss it as scaremongering and exaggeration. But like myself as I write those pieces, they cannot quote what they have seen; they cannot show the level of depravity the hardcore republicans are engaging in to further their cause. I suspect they have seen many things that are even more extreme than I have found. Mainstream society thinks of them as a bit loony, but from what I have seen, they are quite conservative in what they have said. Indeed, I realise that this week's column is a mess as I dare not even remotely echo what I have seen. Something has to change. The system was set up to protect society; to protect the monarchy and this system needs reform. The system, not just the censor-monkeys at the ICT Ministry but the entire judicial process, needs to look beyond the letter of the law (which I believe is noble if a tad anachronistic) and at the spirit of the law. If we really want to protect the monarchy, if that act of protection involves unveiling the enemies of the monarchy and the depravity that they are willing to stoop to and getting a bit messy in the process, so be it."
