Little did she realise that pressing the send button would lead to serious consequences because the young man who she believed she had fallen in love with was an online child predator looking to con young women into sending intimate photos in the guise of a blossoming romance. The next day, her suggestive photo was shared in a private Line group for paedophiles and just about anybody else interested in looking at lewd photos of young girls. The incident drove her into a state of depression, which was further exacerbated by the stress of having to keep up with her school lessons via remote learning at the height of Covid-19. She was overwhelmed with a sense of dread and the thought that such private photos were now being made public. The thought of the photos remaining on the internet until she was old and grey only added to her misery and predicament over how she would deal with the consequences of her actions. Ned's encounter with online child predators amid the Covid-19 pandemic has been shared by numerous other youngsters in the last three months, according to a recent report by the Thailand Internet Crimes Against Children Taskforce (TICAC), which launched a nationwide cyber sting operation targeting online predators with support from local and international law enforcement agencies and NGOs. What was uncovered during the investigation was troubling, to say the least. For one, the global pandemic has done little to deter perpetrators from the online exploitation of countless children who are at home during Covid-19, putting them at higher risk of online criminal activity as they spent more time online. Over the past two months, the TICAC has rescued over 100 children from online cybersex predators, a considerable spike when compared to the total of 53 underage victims that the TICAC rescued from online sexual abuse in the whole of 2018, which at that time was the highest annual figure since the organisation was created in 2016. Since the middle of April this year alone, officials have seized more than 150,000 files of underage pornographic and abuse materials. In an exclusive interview with Life, Pol Lt Gen Jaruvat Vaisaya, assistant police commissioner-general, and TICAC leader said conducting a sting operation of such a nature during Covid-19 had its set of complications due to curfew, social distancing, and self-quarantine requirements, but that overall the sting operation has been a success. Sharing their findings, he continued: ""What we discovered was that during the work from home period, there was an increase in internet usage in several households. Concurrently, lax adult supervision left a loophole for online cybersex predators, most of whom are already on the prowl to abuse children. This led to predators using all sorts of child grooming tactics to lure children after a level of trust has been formed. ""In terms of technology, we found that perpetrators used state-of-the-art gadgets, which made our work all the more challenging when it came to the gathering of evidence. TICAC officers hard at work. Catching online predators has many challenges.  Courtesy of TICAC ""The widespread availability and affordability of high-speed internet and the rise in mobile phone ownership among young people has made the situation even more precarious during Covid-19. ""In terms of tips received on our TICAC and Facebook platforms, we used to average approximately 120,000 each year in the past, however, during the height of Covid-19, which lasted for three months, we received a whopping 160,000 tips in that timeframe alone."" Jaruvat further remarked that in the nearly five years since TICAC has been active, the youngest-ever victim found was four years old. Most of the minors come from dysfunctional and poor backgrounds. ""Predators often prey on children who are the most vulnerable. We also found that many among them suffer from depression. With the internet being readily accessible, these children are often the first to get lured by predators. ""Knowing well that children aren't going to school, predators are taking advantage of this and looking to earn income by exploiting them for their gain. Many of the business dealings they have with potential clients also transpire over the internet, so time is of the essence in our line of work."" Jaruvat said this particular sting operation highlighted the importance of information gathering by the public who sent them tips and clues to catch cybersex predators and people who use the internet to exploit children. The senior officer remarked that the need for information plays a pivotal role in capturing criminals red-handed. However, the information they receive is often incomplete, so officers have to spend a substantial amount of time searching for these missing links. Needless to say, this is a time-consuming task, he said, and as TICAC has a limited number of officers and rising caseload, this can become an obstacle to getting to the victims in time. ""While we are grateful for the tips sent to us, I would request people to find as much information as they can gather about the alleged crime. Some questions to keep in mind are: What happened? Where did the crime occur, when did it take place, and who is the victim? ""If we can receive as many clues to the aforementioned questions, our investigation can move much faster so the perpetrator(s) can be caught before they can get to more children.'' A non-government organisation that has worked closely with TICAC and was a part of their recent sting operation is The Hug Project, a charity that assists trafficked children and has advocated the need for the government to provide better care and education to young people using the internet in schools and at home. Reflecting on the cases, Wirawan Mosby, director of The Hug Project remarked: ""The most disturbing cases are when the victims are so young. We have a case of a young boy who was only seven years old when he was sexually abused and he lived near the offender. The boy went to play computer games at the offender's house. He was sexually abused and then the offender took a photo of him and posted it all over social media. ""Another disturbing case that we received was about a baby being raped. I always think the worst in such cases and have nightmares about how the baby was murdered by the abuser. ""What makes this emotionally unsettling is the fact we do not know who the baby was. We can only locate the person who posted the video but not the source of the video, which could have been produced outside of Thailand."" Speaking on how Thai society, law enforcement, and how the government has played an integral role in addressing the issue of child grooming, Wirawan said: ""I believe that the government is doing a good job by having established TICAC because children now have access to law enforcement who specialise in these types of crimes by utilising the child victim-centric approach. ""Local police still have limited ability to handle these types of cases since they have less access to data and resources. ""TICAC has already worked tirelessly on assisting a number of these victims but the high volume of cases makes it quite challenging and numbers seem to be increasing."" Currently, TICAC is working in partnership with seven NGOs throughout Thailand. TICAC and the Child Advocacy Center, including The Hug Project, work especially close to protect children. Wirawan said that while outside factors related to online cybersex exploitation of minors include widespread availability and affordability of high-speed internet and rise in mobile phone ownership, predators target young children online, specifically teenagers, because they are at an age where they are curious. She added: ""Despite knowing the dangers that lurk, teenagers allow their curiosity to get the better of them. Still, we believe prevention is key. The sad part is that many children are groomed and tricked online since predators use the child's vulnerability and romantic fantasy to get them to do what they want."" Having worked closely with child victims and their families through the years, Wirawan shared a few suggestions on how parents and guardians of underage children can keep their loved ones safe from the prying eyes of predators. ""Parents should do their best to educate themselves and their children on the issues that arise due to this. Predators' strategies are always changing so we should follow the news to learn about those new strategies. Parents should also check their children's devices regularly to see if there are any strangers or people who they have not met in person that has tried to communicate with them on social media,"" she said. ""Children should also be educated about safe touch, unsafe touch, and confusing touch. If any adult touches the child and makes them feel uncomfortable, they should be empowered to say ""no"" without being regarded as rude. ""At a systematic level, the Ministry of Education should enforce child protection policies and internet safety protocols throughout Thailand."" *Not her real name.",OVAC

											Online safety for children is everyone's responsibility										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/1459937/online-safety-for-children-is-everyones-responsibility,"Shutting children away behind closed doors, away from prying eyes and with no internet, can protect them up to a point. But preventing children from engaging with the world hurts their development in the long run. Children need fair, proper and manageable protection from online harm, and that requires collaboration between children, parents, society, businesses and the government, say experts who spoke at a recent event held by the Thai Electronic Transactions Development Agency. Messenger Kids, introduced by Facebook for children as young as six years, was among the topics discussed. A Facebook representative at the event declined to comment, but Andrea Hargrave, director-general of the London-based International Institute of Communications, said applications designed especially for children are not a bad idea in themselves. But business is business, and that's where things get tricky. ""I am sure [products specialised for children] are helpful because they allow children to communicate within a safe space that you know you can trust, like Disney,"" she told Asia Focus. ""But the point is, somebody is obviously making money out of this and they are making money out of your kids' data. ""Parents are caught between a rock and a hard place but you don't just stop them from using [the internet] completely because I don't think you would want to do that. Just as children need to learn how to cross the road, they need to learn how to navigate the digital world."" Many of the efforts related to child safety come from the traditional media content world, which is accustomed to regulation in various forms, but ""this is a different world"", she said. ""We all have to take more responsibility as parents than we have in the past. We need to collaborate and work with industries because industries want you to buy their products and if you walk away from their products, they do not have a business anymore. And that is why Facebook has taken on a number of moderators."" Even though the IT giants are making money from specialised products for children through advertising and selling of data, they are trying to help parents at least understand what they can do to mitigate some of the bigger risks, she said. Kaspersky Lab, a multinational cybersecurity provider, identifies seven dangers that children face online: cyberbullying, cyber predators, posting private information, phishing (emails that try to trick people into clicking on malicious links), falling for scams, accidentally downloading malware, and posts that come back to haunt a child later in life since deleting something forever from the internet is nearly impossible. Kaspersky recommends that parents talk more to their children about what is happening in their lives so they can be alert to bullying or predators. They should remind them that mum and dad can see what they post online, but that they ""don't snoop"". Children can be told about how people can steal private information such as a home address for malicious purposes. Even though your children are smart enough not to send money to Nigerian princes, they might fall for scams that offer things they may want, such as free access to online games in return for parents' credit card information, according to Kaspersky. Parents need to deliver the age-old caution to children about offers that sound too good to be true. Ms Hargrave agrees that safety starts with talking to children, but monitoring their use of devices is difficult. ""For example, is your child allowed to take an iPad to bed because they want to play some games? And at what age do you give your child a smartphone?"" In the UK, many children are allowed to independently use smartphones when they reach secondary school because they are travelling on their own to school. But increasingly, younger children are getting smartphones because of ""peer pressure"" that parents should try to resist, she said. The formal education system also has a role to play. ""I think that in Thailand you have enormous opportunity. It is a country that respects teachers and learning and I also think teachers need to be helped to understand what the issues are in the way that parents do."" Canada and Singapore, in her view, are the most advanced countries in terms of media literacy. In Singapore, experts have been teaching safe use of the internet in schools for two decades. Parents' associations often discuss online safety. ""I am sure you can do something like that here,"" she said. Because private companies are the ""gatekeepers"" of the internet, the public should be able to trust them to deal with some of the problems that arise, said Dr Joan Barata, founder of the Vienna-based consultancy CommVisions. ""On the other hand, I also believe that in order to perform that important task, these private companies need direction from the government because in some cases, government institutions ... are better suited to define what is in the public interest or what is acceptable and what is not,"" he said. In addition to heeding guidance from public bodies, private companies need input from parents and civil society organisations on community standards. ""In many cases you cannot have just one petrified code, but more like a set of rules that needs to be able to adapt to circumstances. In many cases, only thanks to feedback can you know that you are doing your work properly and make good judgements,"" said Dr Barata. Dr Masato Kajimoto, a journalism professor and founder of the Asia Pacific Digital Citizens Network, favours educating children in media literacy over heavy regulation. Children can be taught how to self-regulate, he said, based on what seems to be working in Japan, where media literacy is part of the public school curriculum. ""My recommendation is to find a way for media literacy education to be integrated into the public education system in one way or another. It could be just 15 minutes every two weeks for those aged between 7 and 17,"" he told Asia Focus. For the younger age group, Dr Kajimoto recommends teaching empathy and ethical behaviour to reduce cyberbullying. Older children can be taught to think more analytically about content by answering questions. On seeing a popular TV show, for example, they could be asked: why do you think this drama is popular, why was it created, why does it appeal emotionally? ""What we do with high school and university students is almost pure journalism, including fact checking and verification, and the same thing can be done for entertainment content but slightly different because it is mostly made up,"" he said. ""These kinds of analyses of media content could probably help them develop critical thinking skills that they could use to protect themselves from cyber harm.""",OVAC
2,2,2018-01-08 04:30:00,The predator next door,https://www.bangkokpost.com/life/social-and-lifestyle/1392254/the-predator-next-door,"Enticed by the pretty face who sent him a Facebook friend request, 14-year-old Boom* struck up a friendship online with an imposter, a 20-year-old ladyboy who was posing as a teen heartthrob. One thing led to another, and the unsuspecting Boon fell head over heels in love with a person he believed was a woman over a video live chat. The imposter gained the boy's trust to the point that he got carried away and masturbated while on one of their live chats unaware he was being recorded. The ladyboy sold the clip of the boy on Twitter. Boon's school friends eventually got a hold of this clip and he became the laughingstock of the school. The embarrassment took a toll on the teen and his grades started to fall, and he fell into depression. His parents eventually got wind of what had happened and took him to file a complaint at the police station. Pol Col Thakoon Nimsomboon, head of the TICAC operations team, left, and Pol Col Soonthorn Arunnara, leader of the TICAC northeastern team. Photo: YVONNE BOHWONGPRASERT It was at this juncture that Thailand Internet Crimes Against Children (TICAC) task force were notified. They contacted the US embassy in Thailand for help, and finally traced the Facebook and Twitter accounts to a ladyboy in Khon Kaen province. ""This is one among many criminal cases on the internet that TICAC has investigated through painstaking dedication, perseverance and team work, "" said Pol Col Thakoon Nimsomboon, head of operations team. ""Usually the victims are emotionally and physically in a bad shape when we reach them. As a father myself, it is disturbing to witness the trauma these children undergo. Someone has to get the work done, so we are determined to do all that is in our power to first rescue the child victim and than catch the perpetrators. Even though we have to sit through hours of footage of vile acts being done on children to determine the location or name of the victim."" Thakoon, who has a doctorate in criminal justice from a US-based university, said he hopes to increase awareness of child predators lurking online. Parents and teachers in particular have to be on alert, he said, because children today are computer savvy and mature earlier than previous generations. Alarmingly, while child and adult pornography is widely accessible on the internet, very little has been done globally to protect children from becoming victims, he said. Members of the task force. Photo courtesy of Thailand Internet Crimes Against Children [TICAC] He suggested data be kept on criminals and shared with the public when deemed necessary. Adding that while government-run agencies have began this process, it is still in its infancy stage. The public has the right to know if they are safe among their neighbours. To make his point, Thakoon shared a case where a young woman was raped and murdered by a man who lived next door to her. The case raised concerns at many levels, he said. ""Doesn't everyone have the right to know if they are safe where they live so they can take precautions. If I have a young daughter, it is my right to know as a father that the man who has rented the flat next to mine is not a paedophile. ""We can no longer brush this issue under the carpet by saying people who have served a jail sentence especially for heinous crimes have the right to not inform the public when they are released."" Another disturbing observation made by Thakoon was the young age of paedophiles he came to meet during his investigations, contrary to the popular belief that paedophiles are old men. The youngest he has come across was only 15. The Thai teenager had begun targeting toddlers years earlier. ""I was rather taken aback to see this young man tell me how he was sexually aroused by three-year-old children. Before meeting him, I had presumed paedophiles to be much older,"" he said. ""Some of the youngest victims are just a couple of months old."" Offenders come from all walks of life and nationalities. Some are from highly respected careers. Thakoon said the public and government have to work together to build a society where people have the right to reside in a safe environment. Pol Col Soonthorn Arunnara leads the TICAC team in the northeast. The law enforcement officer is credited for playing a pivotal role in amending the law stipulating penalties for the possession of child pornography. He said the most challenging aspect of his work with TICAC was to observe society's indifference towards children. He based this assumption on how criminal cases are prioritised. Raising the rape/murder of Nong Cartoon, the six-year-old who was murdered by a man who had previously killed 10 children, he said: ""This case, while making headline news, did little to stir up support to protect our children, in contradiction to drug-related cases where there is huge support. Criminal minds use these loopholes for their benefit. TICAC was set up in part to see that our children take first priority."" In terms of evidence, he said that when law enforcement work on crimes that are committed online, there is often not as such tangible evidence as they would see in a drug-related case, so it is plausible this could put people off showing a greater amount of interest in addressing crimes of a sexual nature involving children. Soonthorn said the attitude Thais have towards child pornography was also troubling. During the amending of the law stipulating penalties for the possession of child pornography, he said he received a barrage of criticism from the public for his stance. ""By and large the attitude was 'what's the big deal', this really made it all the more necessary for me to see it become law,"" Soonthorn said. ""Thai society still views the situation of watching child pornography in a light-hearted manner. They feel it is OK to watch because they are not physically touching the child."" To address the issue of cyber crime against children, both officers suggest parents and teachers work closely to offer mentors for different age groups, so when an issue arises, children are able to be counselled by a reliable person. Instead of totally depending on police to keep them safe, they should form neighbourhood watch groups. As parents themselves, both felt it was up to fathers and mothers to foster better ties with their children, saying: ""Parents have to teach children about the birds and the bees before they learn it from people with ill intentions. Keep a close tab on the websites kids are on today. If you build trust with your child, there is little to worry."" - TICAC task force, set up on Jan 8, 2016, is supported by the FBI and the US Department of Homeland Security, and designed to share intelligence. - There are currently 135 officers, 114 men and 21 women, working around the clock. - Utilising a US model, TICAC combats sexual exploitation facilitated via the internet. For instance, Thai law enforcement officials just started working directly with the US National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children to share real-time information about victims and offenders. - Once victims are detected, the next step is providing them with assistance, standard practice for the FBI. - For TICAC, victim assistance is not just the morally correct course of action, it provides information that helps police more effectively investigate lawbreakers.

											Online task force closes the net on paedophiles										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/special-reports/1292363/online-task-force-closes-the-net-on-paedophiles,"A schoolboy came to the police with a broken heart. He was utterly embarrassed but decided to tell police that a video clip of him masturbating had been distributed online and he wanted it removed. It transpired that he had fallen in love with a beautiful woman he met on the internet. They developed their relationship through video live chat, he got carried away and pleasured himself without knowing he was being recorded. He later found he was the victim of a group of transvestites who stole other people's pictures and created fake identities to lure young men like him in order to blackmail them. An investigation by the Thailand Internet Crimes Against Children (TICAC) Task Force found over 100 such video clips and dozens of victims. The task force is expanding its investigation into this case, which happened in a northeastern province. The number of teenage victims is expected to reach 200. At the same time, in another northeastern province, a similar case is being investigated in which an internet user with the identity of a handsome Thai-Singaporean luk krung seduces women he meets online, claiming to be in love with his victims. The women, some in their 30s, agreed to prove their real love even if it meant they had to have sex with a stranger as requested by the handsome man online. ""Internet crimes against children are modern crimes happening in a complex environment while the crime scenes are also 'in the cloud'. In this era of the digital economy and digital society, people live in the cloud,"" said TICAC head Tamasak Wicharaya, also an acting deputy commissioner-general of the Royal Thai Police. Each year, about 50,000 downloads and uploads of child pornography are detected in the kingdom by the task force. Such acts are now a crime in Thailand. On Dec 8, 2015, Thailand amended the Criminal Law stipulating penalties for the possession of child pornography as well as transferring or disseminating such material. The penalties include up to five years’ imprisonment and/or a fine of up to 100,000 baht for personal use, and up to seven years’ imprisonment and/or a fine of up to 140,000 baht for commercial use. A month later, TICAC was set up as an ad hoc agency to tackle internet crimes against children, with the support of Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwon in charge of national security and the officers of the Homeland Security Investigations attached to the US embassy in Bangkok. As of June 29, TICAC had received tip-offs and complaints about 129 incidents, with 36 being investigated. Out of these cases, 24 or 67% involve child pornography, eight or 22% involve child sexual abuse and four cases or 11% involve human trafficking. About a quarter of the total cases have been concluded. Among the 35 suspects, 29 were arrested, five foreigners were sent back to their own countries and one is pending charges. RELATED CRIMES Internet crimes against children, besides damaging the victims, are linked to other problems including human trafficking. Child porn images can be used to blackmail and force victims to do things against their will. Meanwhile, such material could lead to other sex crimes such as harassment and rape. Among the cases investigated by TICAC, the youngest victim was four years old. The victim, from an ethnic minority in Chiang Mai's Fang district, was held naked and photographed with the offender, who was also naked. Expert analysts said the pictures could be sexually arousing. If disseminated, they could arouse the viewers to commit sex crimes, Pol Gen Tamasak said. PREDATORS AND PREY TICAC keeps an eye on paedophiles, especially foreigners who have a history of child sexual abuse and those with a history of watching or producing child pornography, Pol Gen Tamasak said. When Thai authorities receive alerts from foreign agencies, such as the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children, the foreigners will be followed more closely. If they are spotted uploading or downloading porn images, police can request a warrant to search their residence and check their mobile phone and computer. If pornographic material is found, they are subject to a criminal lawsuit. ""Some foreigners portray themselves as a saints providing help and giving sweets to children. Once they gain trust of the children, they find a chance to be alone with them and record the victim being abused, then use the media to threaten and further abuse them,"" he added. Meanwhile, TICAC looks after vulnerable children. ""Children from poor families or broken homes are the most vulnerable. Once they fall prey to paedophiles, it is difficult for them to get over the experiences and live in society as normal. They will fall back again as a victim,"" Pol Gen Tamasak said. Poor children looking for work sometimes end up in the sex industry. Afterwards, they became subject of porn media which the offenders use to blackmail and force them to continue working in the industry, which is a recurring pattern in many cases, he added. Children from broken homes who spend a lot of time alone with stepfathers are also at risk. They are usually too frightened to speak out if they are sexually abused, he said. Reports from Khon Kaen and Nakhon Ratchasima revealed that children who have access to the internet are often lured by paedophiles who groom their victims through online communication. PREVENTIVE MEASURES Sex criminals have a higher reoffending rates than other criminals, Eric McLouglin, regional attache of the US Department of Homeland Security, said. Moreover, just as the criminals have networks to share information and adapt rapidly, authorities have to join hands and get ahead of the criminals and implement preventive measures before new crimes happen, he added. TICAC, together with its network including NCMEC, detect and locate uploaders and downloaders of pornographic material before going to search, investigate and take legal action against them before they can commit more crimes. Information from other security agencies also contribute to preventive measures. Last year, after requests to immigration police, 26 Americans were denied entry to Thailand as they had criminal records of child abuse. ""Human trafficking, especially involving children, is the most serious type of crime. The community has a right to know that you are a bad guy. We can locate where you are,"" Pol Gen Tamasak said. ""We are sending a clear message -- Thailand is no longer a safe haven for criminals,"" said the TICAC chief.  

 The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Homeland Security Investigations have organised a training course for police, social workers and non-governmental organisations. (Video by Pornprom Satrabhaya) INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION Among the cases concluded by TICAC, of the 129 incidents, information of 88 incidents, or 68%, came from foreign agencies including law enforcement, embassies and NGOs providing information about offenders, victims and the damaged parties. The FBI and the Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) have vowed to give full support to Thai police to bring wrongdoers to justice if Americans commit crimes in Thailand. Eight Americans have been prosecuted and several have been repatriated to serve penalties in the US. There are factors to consider in deciding whether to send the suspects back to their own country or to have them prosecuted in Thailand. Chief among these is the chance of a successful prosecution, said John Schachnovsky, FBI legal attache at the US embassy in Bangkok. Fighting such crimes needs collaboration from law enforcement officials, social workers and NGOs as well as the private sector, including telecommunication service providers. The special teams include victim analysts and digital forensic analysts. THE ROLE OF NGOs Many times, NGOs are the first to respond to victims. Mr Schachnovsky, who has been in Thailand for seven years, said many years ago NGOs and the police did not want to work with each other. ""Their attitude was 'we don't need them',"" said the FBI officer referring to the situation in the past. However, they later realised that they needed each other to successfully put the wrongdoers behind bars and protect innocent people. More NGOs are happy to join forces with the law enforcement team. Wirawan ""Boom"" Mosby, the 2017 recipient of the US Secretary of State Trafficking in Persons Report Hero Award, is also an active member of TICAC. The director of the Hope, Understanding and Grace (HUG) project in Chiang Mai has been providing investigative support through fact finding, case coordination and consultations with various law enforcement, social work, NGO and government officials. She also conducts key forensic interviews with child victims of trafficking and sexual abuse. She also spearheaded the opening of ACT (Advocacy Center For Children Thailand) House, the first such centre in Southeast Asia, which also has branches in Pattaya and Phuket. ""To make further progress, we need to educate and train people how to properly address these issues,"" Ms Mosby said in an interview with the Bangkok Post. ""Preconceived ideas and misconceptions have to be replaced with the right type of knowledge so that victims will be encouraged to seek help. They have to be told they are not at fault. We need more people with a heart for victims of sexual and domestic violence. It is pivotal to not prejudge their actions."" SPECIAL TRAINING Information from the victims is the key to success in an investigation, finding the wrongdoers and the prosecution. However, to get such information from victims and witnesses who have been through an ordeal is not easy, and sensitivity must be kept in mind. ""We want the entire story to come from the victim, not from us. Even if we go into the interview knowing a lot of factual information because evidence has been gathered, we still need all that information to come from the victim. And sometimes with younger children, it's a very difficult task to ask them to do that. So we need to make sure that we ask appropriate questions that a child can understand and can relate to and respond,"" said Crystal Gregory, forensic interview specialist and national programme manager at HSI. In the case of forced labour in the fisheries industry, police investigation stalled. Despite the evidence and witnesses' accounts, the police failed to get the victims' accounts. A key Cambodian victim lost his memory and refused to say anything as a result of being tortured on a boat. It took the police and related experts two years of patience and skills to help the victim regain his memory, and then he finally gave information that led to a successful prosecution, Pol Gen Tamasak said. From July 10-14, the FBI and the HSI as well as the US embassy organised a special training course on forensic interviewing of child and adolescent victims and witnesses for Thai police, social workers and NGOs including HUG from Chiang Mai, A21 from Pattaya and For Freedom International from Phuket. The course was on different skills and techniques to talk to victims of crimes such as trafficking in persons, child exploitation and forced child labour to ensure that the victims can feel safe and provide a safe environment to talk about the abuse they encountered, said Ms Gregory, one of the trainers. It also discussed victimisation, the effects of trauma and how a victim can face different problems throughout the process. The training also included steps to provide a safe environment in a neutral location, and to make sure that during the interview, the interviewers are not blaming the victims, Ms Gregory added. It was the same 40-hour basic training provided to the American investigation teams. The failure to properly interview victims will not only jeopardise the legal case but can also ruin the lives of the victims, especially when they are children, said the Department of Homeland Security's Mr McLouglin. Interviewing the victims of human trafficking and other forms of exploitation must be based on the principle of a victim-centric approach, he added. ""The interviewers need the skills and interview techniques to make sure that the victims are not re-victimised, and they must be interviewed in a safe place. Otherwise, they might see investigators as bad people and will not open up,"" Mr McLouglin said. Mr Schachnovsky said the interview must be in a friendly environment, not where uniformed police are walking around. Children's advocacy centres, currently available in Chiang Mai, Pattaya and Phuket, are examples of a suitable interview environment. The interviewer and the victim have a one-to-one interview in a room, which other investigators can watch from another room via video. ""We must keep in mind that the victims must be able to go back into society. Every part of the investigation is very important. If it fails, it will hurt the victims for their whole life,"" Mr Schachnovsky said. The group hopes to set the victim-centric approach as the standard for interviews. BUILDING TRUST, EXPANDING FORCES While Mr Schachnovsky praised the efficiency and effectiveness that TICAC has shown through its success in less than two years, Pol Gen Tamasak pointed out that it was a small team of committed people who understand each other. Meanwhile, it has gained understanding and assistance from police from different departments. They have to strengthen trust and regularly check among themselves to make sure that they are free from bad influences caused by the traumatic nature of their work.

											Paedophile faces new charges										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/402373/swirly-face-predator-charged-again,"VANCOUVER - A former Canadian schoolteacher who spent five years in a Thai prison for sexually abusing children after an image of his digitally obscured face was reconstructed is facing 10 new charges, Canadian police say. This series of photos shows the original swirled photo Neil posted of himself, and the work Interpol did to ""un-swirl"" it. He was spotted by a hotel's CCTV checking in for a Pattaya stay, where he was arrested. In custody and in prison in Thailand, he was almost always shown smiling. (Photo by Interpol, Bangkok Post.) The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said Christopher Paul Neil was arrested for sexual touching and child pornography production, which police say occurred in 2003 in Cambodia, and possession of child pornography in 2007 in Canada. He also faces additional counts of accessing child pornography.     Neil became known notoriously as the ""swirly face"" paedophile because of the way he had altered his image online. The Canadian taught in several Asian countries before being first arrested in northeastern Thailand in October 2007 following an international manhunt after hundreds of photos of him allegedly engaging in sex acts with young boys were discovered on the Internet. Neil was arrested in Thailand after Interpol unscrambled swirled digital images from about 200 internet photos, which showed Neil engaging in sexual acts with boys.      He released from prison in Thailand and returned to Canada in 2012 under strict conditions meant to protect children, but he pleaded guilty to breaching a condition last year after police found him with a laptop in breach of his conditions.     Police said the latest apprehension was the result of investigations by both RCMP Integrated Child Exploitation and Vancouver city police. In September 2012, Thai officials in Thailand confirmed that evidence provided by Canadian police in their case had not been used in their prosecution. Canadian investigators working with prosecutors reviewed their findings and conducted follow up investigations. ",OVAC

											DTAC joins effort to push e-learning platform										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/1969943/dtac-joins-effort-to-push-e-learning-platform,"Total Access Communication (DTAC), the country's third largest mobile operator by subscribers, has joined the Digital Economy Promotion Agency (Depa) and the Thai Media Fund in rolling out an e-learning platform to enhance digital literacy among youth. The move aims to turn youths susceptible to online abuse into agents promoting digital literacy among friends. The platform was introduced yesterday by Nuttapon Nimmanphatcharin, president of Depa; Thanakorn Srisuksai, manager of the Thai Media Fund; Marcus Adaktusson, chief corporate affairs officer of DTAC; and Srida Tanta-atipanit, manager of the Internet Foundation for the Development of Thailand. ""One in three kids in Thailand have faced cyberbullying according to a recent survey of 15,348 respondents aged 6-18,"" said Ms Srida. She said 25% of respondents engaged in online meetings and they faced fraud, attempts to lure them into illicit gangs, stalking as well as sexual harassment. The survey found 73% view pornographic content, nearly 50% see child pornography and 5.5% own child pornography, while 12.1% see gambling advertising and 2.8% gamble online. Mr Nuttapon said children own digital devices quite early in Thailand, which is among the top five countries in Asia-Pacific for youth ownership, but they lack sufficient digital literacy. Thai youngsters spend 5-10 hours a day online. He said Thailand needs to fill 40,000 digital skill positions per year, but only 20,000 graduates are able to fill them and 13,000 of them are likely to work in corporations. Referring to children's digital literacy, he said it is important to equip children with this skill to protect them against online abuse. ""Proactive new skill sets are needed as Thailand gears up for digital transformation, particularly in the real sectors,"" said Mr Nuttapon. Mr Adaktusson said young people need to have digital resilience and literacy in order to leverage digital tools for national and social development. ""Youth are on a rapid digital transformation journey that has challenges and opportunities. The Covid-19 outbreak has changed the learning and teaching landscape, with online classes becoming much more common,"" he said. Children can learn about digital literacy via https://learn.safeinternet.camp. The website has topics such as online privacy and sexual abuse, ways to stop cyberbullying and identifying fake news. The digital upskilling course includes artificial intelligence-powered chatbots, data visualisation, storytelling and gamification.",OVAC

											Get a grip on bullying										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/1938840/get-a-grip-on-bullying,"As a corporate employee, I feel privileged that I'm able to work from home for most of the week. While the nature of my job allows me and my small team to carry on as usual, many other kinds of work require the physical presence of staff in a place of business. But the more time I've spent at home, the more distressing news I've been seeing about harassment, abuse and domestic violence. Online abuse is a growing concern. In Japan, the number of people who called a government hotline to report online abuse exceeded 5,100 in the fiscal year ending in March, compared to slightly over 1,000 nine years ago, a recent report showed. With home-bound people spending even more time on social media, some of it for work purposes, we've been seeing more cases of intimidation and abuse in the virtual world. The conventional wisdom is that working from home should free people from exposure to toxic workplace behaviour. But the new normal approach has actually opened the door for other forms of harassment. Harassment and intimidation based on gender or race has taken the form of being excluded from virtual meetings or bullied over video calls. Such provocations would have been harder to carry out in an office where other people are present. During not-so-formal meetings and conversations online, the boundaries between work and private life are blurred, which can also create a climate for harassment. Working out of our kitchens and living rooms can lead people to let their guard down and be more informal, or in some cases, improper. A comment about what colleagues, clients or other contacts see in the background at our house can all too easily be followed by unsolicited remarks about a person's appearance or by an inappropriate joke. Some companies have postponed investigations into harassment cases due to the pandemic. This is definitely not an encouraging sign. Virtual communication also provides a degree of anonymity that can lead people to act in ways they would not in person. The result has been the rise of cyberbullying as a global phenomenon. In Japan, the severity of the problem was driven home by the recent death of Hana Kimura, a 22-year-old professional wrestler and reality-TV star. She posted self-harm images on Twitter shortly before taking her life, implying she had suffered from cyberbullying. Her case has drawn attention once more to the delicate balance of regulation versus free speech. The bullying culture in Japan is so pervasive that Covid-related school closures and telecommuting have given rise to jokes about the unexpected benefits of staying at home -- a reprieve from school and workplace bullying. But the bullies are still there, lurking behind their screens. While those who have been defamed online can ask telecom providers and website operators to voluntarily disclose anonymous attackers' IP addresses, names and street addresses, the fact is governments have struggled to come up with effective solutions. Early this month, regulations to protect workers in Japan from abusive bosses and colleagues took effect. Large companies now must combat so-called power harassment, which includes such acts as striking an employee with one's bare hands or an object. Firms are legally required to have strict policies against workplace bullying. They must train employees and have a contact point for reporting cases of abuse. Companies allowing egregious abuse to occur will be publicly named. But cyberbullying is harder to police and not solely a Japanese problem. Similar cases have been reported in South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand. South Korean legislators have been pushing a bill that proposes making anti-cyberbullying education compulsory in schools, and allowing the identification and prosecution of those who post malicious online content. Of course, laws cannot fix every problem we face. Better behaviour should start with improved education in schools about how to use the internet more effectively and ethically. There is also no quick fix for office harassment and bullying, but employers can put more effort into offering training and following up on complaints. Companies, meanwhile, need to send a strong anti-harassment message and get more people involved in rooting out misconduct, while staff must be encouraged to speak up when they spot inappropriate behaviour. Experts also recommend easier reporting mechanisms for employees. As company managers focus on returning to work as virus concerns ease, healthy employment conditions must be a firm priority. Among those, concerns about harassment can't be ignored.",OVAC

									What's going on with netizens today? A few years ago they said that the internet would be a new medium to bring people closer together, but why does it seem now that these technologies are tearing us apart? In this age of new communication, technologies and social media have made it easier for us to stay in touch with the people we care about, like family members and friends, and even strangers from different places and cultures around the world. However, what this comes with is a dark side of being so connected.								 Today, the word ""cyberbullying"" has become more and more common -- something we see and hear every day on the news and can relate to from our own experience. The stories about anonymous online harassment have made a significant impact on society, especially among teenagers. It highlights some of the dangers of the new world we're living in. ""Die"", ""You are disgusting"", ""You should disappear"". On May 23, Hana Kimura, 22, a professional wrestler and cast member of the latest season of the popular Japanese reality show on Netflix, Terrace House, took her own life after reportedly receiving a barrage of mean, hurtful, tormenting and abusive messages on social media every day, mostly criticising her about her looks and her behaviour on the show. A few hours prior to her death, Kimura reportedly tweeted about how she felt hurt by the messages and how she no longer wanted to live. ""Nearly 100 frank opinions every day. I couldn't deny they hurt me. I believed these things about myself more than they did. Thank you, Mother, for the gift of life. My whole life I wanted to be loved. Thank you to everyone who supported me. I love you all. I'm sorry for being weak."" As a fan of the show, I was stunned and shocked on the day I read the news about her death. This is such a tragedy. How can a girl who is younger than me and with a bright future ahead be pushed to take her own life? But as I wondered, I also learned that she was one of countless many around the world struggling with the same problem. Thailand is no exception. According to the Department of Mental Health, data from research in ""Bullying In The Upper Secondary School Students"", which was conducted in collaboration with 13 other universities around the world, showed that one in three Thai children experience bullying, especially in the online world. The respondents said that 34.6% bullied other people, 37.8% were used to being bullied, and another 39% were involved in a bullying event. What makes online bullying so effective is that it can be done anonymously. This allows these posts to be read by so many others online and also makes it much easier for other people to ""join in"" and become part of the bullying process. I'm pretty sure that teenagers are not mean devils that run around with cruel intentions. However, from the same data, the younger age group of 13 to 19 were 40% more willing to post an offensive message than an older age group. The nature of the teenage brain is likened to a car with no brakes, no pausing, and no consideration. Young people don't think before they act and that's why they hardly think clearly before they type. So why are we putting the burden on the victim to forget or block the cyberbully? Why aren't we changing the behaviour of the actual cyberbully? And this is where parents and guardians must come in. You need to teach and educate children on how to think before typing offensive messages and explain the consequences of those actions and how damage is done to others. As for the case of victims of bullying, young people are especially vulnerable as their identities are still developing and they may not know how to cope with their feelings. So those who are left unsupported can develop unhealthy coping strategies that can lead to self harm, further isolation and eventually even suicide. It is your job to pay more attention and be more supportive of your children rather than wait for them to come to you. Research has shown that nine out of 10 times victims will feel embarrassed about their problem and they won't tell anyone that they're being cyberbullied. Parents should build good relationships with children to give the child enough trust to share their life stories when there is a problem. At the end of the day, mental health conditions are treatable, and suicide is preventable. We can combat hopelessness and despair if we really care.

9,9,2020-01-15 04:01:00,The sad world of online gaming,https://www.bangkokpost.com/life/social-and-lifestyle/1836154/the-sad-world-of-online-gaming,"The news and images of two Thai e-sport teams that won gold medals at the recent SEA Games 2019 brought joy to people. Yet, for many people, the growth and popularity of e-sports has also led to other concerns. While e-sports as a profession has become a lucrative endeavour for some young people, not all gamers end up awash in money. While on their way to achieving such a goal, many become gaming addicts. The Radio and Media Association for Children and Youth (RMACY) studied 3,056 people aged 15-18 from September to October last year and found that a number of young people spent lots of time playing online games. During weekends and holidays, 32.56% of respondents spent three to five hours a day playing online games. Adolescents in Bangkok played the longest -- more than eight hours a day on weekends. Mobile phones allow games to be played anywhere. Around 70% of respondents played games at home or in dormitories while almost 18% played games at school, in bathrooms and bedrooms. A concern about gamers often involves violent behaviours related to the games they play. From the study, samples who played Mobile Legends, Starcraft II and Tekken 7 showed violent behaviour.  To prevent children from potential dangers posed by gaming and the internet, the RMACY recently organised a forum titled ""Online Threats To Children"" to discuss how certain online activities could harm young people. The forum focused on two main threats -- online games and cyberbullying. ""Playing a game is an activity that adolescents choose to spend time on. While playing games for long hours, they told their parents that they were preparing for a sports competition. Gaming cafes have been changed into e-sport centres, which provide instalment payments, food, bathrooms and bedrooms. Players don't need to go home,"" said Teerarat Pantawee Wongtanaanek, the study's lead author and president of RMACY. Dr Tipawan Buranasin, a psychiatrist at the Child And Adolescent Mental Health Rajanagarindra Institute, the Department of Mental Health under the Ministry of Public Health, also explained how game addictions affect lives of teenagers. ""The World Health Organisation recognised gaming disorder or gaming addiction as a disease. Young people who are addicted to games have other mental conditions such as anxiety, impulsivity and attention deficit disorder. Addicted gamers who spend time on screens and don't have proper meals have weight and height lower than average. These gamers are short and not intelligent. I met young addicted gamers who spent lots of money to top up games. A recent case spent 100,000 baht for a game,"" Dr Tipawan said. Despite a high number of gamers, Thailand has poor management to protect minors. A researcher from Srida Tanthaatipanich of Thailand Science Research and Innovation said South Korea, which has a lot of gamers, only allows players older than 18 to participate in e-sport tournaments. ""South Korea is a leading country in the gaming industry, but they don't allow minors to attend e-sport competitions. Unlike Thailand, they aim to make money from programme development not e-sport competitions. They have regulations that prevent children from becoming addicted to games. If gamers are younger than 16, they must receive permission from parents to play. These young gamers can't access online games from midnight to 6am every day,"" Srida said. ""In China, the government sets rules for minors. Gamers must verify their age. If they are under 18 years old, there are playtime restrictions. Young gamers can play only 90 minutes during weekdays and three hours on weekends and holidays. The gaming companies had to create new technologies to support this regulation."" RMACY, Child Online Protection Action Thailand (COPAT), the Internet Foundation for the Development of Thailand, the National Health Foundation and medical institutions are working together to draft legislation that would regulate the gaming industry. Tips on how to cope with cyberbullying by the Internet Foundation for the Development of Thailand ""We are glad to see the gaming industry grow, but some of their revenues are from children and parents who may or may not be willing to pay for the games. We should have a policy that regulates which games are appropriate for minors. There should be a game rating. ""Violent games shouldn't be included in any competitions. Game centres where players can sleep should or shouldn't serve young gamers. We are working together for draft legislation,"" said Teerarat. In a separate study, the Internet Foundation for the Development of Thailand found that one-third of child gamers experienced some form of cyberbullying, while another third of the victims bullied others. The study also revealed that around 40% of  cyberbullying victims remained silent and that victims tended to be girls and LGBTI more than boys. The president of the Children and Youth Council of Thailand, Supapich Thaipradit, called for a greater understanding on the cause and effects of cyberbullying. ""There is no clear standard on bullying. What bothers one person doesn't affect another. If a child observes adults and friends acting in a certain way, that child will repeat that action. Sometimes that behaviour moves online. This is a serious issue. It can lead to depression and suicide,"" Supapich said. Mangmoom, a teacher from an all-boy government school, said there was bullying and cyberbullying in the school. ""When students are bullied, most of them discuss it with their friends. They seek help from their teachers when they can no longer cope. Unfortunately, some teachers think bullying and cyberbullying are something normal. It happens every day,"" the teacher said. Kannikar Tomeena, chief of the Radio and Television Broadcasting Technology Programme, the Faculty of Mass Communication Technology at Rajamangala University of Technology Phra Nakhon, said there are five steps to cope with cyberbullying -- stop, block, tell (ask for help), remove (cyberbullying photos or messages) and (be) strong. ""In a seminar, junior high school students said they keep several Facebook accounts, with one of the accounts used to schedule fights with other students. Teachers have to use their connections to find out about these schedules. The situation is scary,"" Kannikar said. ""For parents, if your children experience cyberbullying, you must understand that it wasn't something normal. Don't tell a child that a bully will quit by himself or herself. The bullying experiences will stay with them until they grow up. Most importantly you must be friends with your children. If you are their friends, they will come to you when they are in trouble. Yet, some parents aren't close to their children. Those students will speak with their friends instead."" Kannikar explained that cyberbullying victims should stop engaging with their bully. ""The bully feels entertained when the victim retaliates to their messages or photos. If the victim ignores them, they won't have fun anymore. Then, block the bully's account. Don't be friends with her or him,"" she suggested. Supapich suggests instead of responding to a bully, people should focus on how strong the victim is. ""If the victim can't tolerate humiliation from the bully, she or he can explode. We should build up self-esteem in young people. With strong self esteem, we will feel secure and don't care about others' comments,"" she said. ""There are some suggestions that said parents should set rules about how many hours young people can use the internet and phones. Young people dislike rules. It would be better if parents discuss with their children and set rules together.""",OVAC
10,10,2019-11-06 04:01:00,A thousand cuts,https://www.bangkokpost.com/life/social-and-lifestyle/1788384/a-thousand-cuts,"At the zenith of her career in music, South Korean singer and actress Sulli appeared as if she was living a perfect life. Unfortunately, the dark side to her apparent fairy tale was revealed with her recent tragic death. A former member of top girl group f(x), the 25-year-old pin-up, whose real name was Choi Jin-ri, was reported to have committed suicide at her home south of Seoul. Although the police did not find a suicide note, Sulli was known to have suffered from severe depression. Prior to her death, Sulli was recognised as a prominent, outspoken feminist voice. She was, for example, vocal about not wearing a bra -- a stance that not only defied the careful brand management of the K-pop industry but also conservative attitudes towards young women in South Korea as a whole. ""She wasn't just an issue-maker but I hope she will be remembered as a women's rights activist who was free-spirited, who could truly speak her mind,"" said Kwon Ji-an, a South Korean singer and painter, as reported by Reuters. Not everyone agrees with Ji-an, especially in cyberspace where many show zero tolerance towards those who think or act differently. Sulli was subjected to sustained malicious online criticism and cyberbullying. Her case is indicative of an alarming global trend from an increasing number of netizens, whose lives appear to revolve heavily around the world wide web. Ultimately, tragically, Sulli wasn't resilient enough to handle the relentless abuse. The death of Sulli is a wake-up call for internet users around the world to recognise the toxic online environment that they are increasingly a part of -- one that potentially costs human lives. In South Korea, her death has intensified demands for state action against cyberbullying. The country's national assembly will reportedly begin debating a bill, already dubbed ""Sulli's law"", later this year, according to The Guardian. ""Freedom of expression is a vital value in democratic society, but insulting and hurting someone else's dignity is beyond that limit. There need to be far harsher penalties for those who violate that law,"" said Lee Dong-gwi, a psychology professor at Yonsei University in Seoul, as reported by Reuters. Psychiatrist Dr Piyawat Dendumrongkul of CGH Hospital admits that cyberbullying is a growing concern in countries across the world. Thailand is no exception. ""This issue is partly due to globalisation, which allows more connectivity among people,"" said Dr Piyawat. ""The physical bullying that takes place in the real world can now be done more easily in the virtual world. It isn't that the degree of severity escalates, but... the consequences seem more public, more severe and more excruciating. Because now bullying can take place repeatedly -- everywhere, anytime."" Various organisations have collected and released data on cyberbullying in recent years. Ditch The Label, a UK-based international anti-bullying charity, reports that, in terms of social media platforms, cyberbullying is most prevalent on Instagram (42%), followed by Facebook (37%) and Snapchat (31%). Statista, a German online portal for statistics, reveals that women are most vulnerable on Facebook. Based on figures from the Cyberbullying Research Center in the US, the most common types of online harassment, according to US students, are mean comments (22.5%), online rumours (20.1%) and sexual remarks (12.1%). Away from the internet, victims of bullying do at least have a ""break"", where they are away from their tormentors. A student who is the target of school bullies, for example, can find relief when they get back home. But with the internet being accessible anywhere and anytime, online attacks can seem constant. Worse, says Dr Piyawat, cyberbullying is often  unintentional. ""By definition, cyberbullying is an act of bullying, threatening or intimidation that takes place through digital devices like smartphones, computers or tablets, which can either have direct or indirect impact on the bullied person's reputation, person or things. But many times, cyberbullying can take place unintentionally too, like when people make comments which are not meant to be rude or harsh but... hurt other people's feelings. That is labelled cyberbullying as well."" People with wealth, fame or high social status like Sulli are not necessarily more resilient towards online criticism than ordinary people. Nor are adults always better at dealing with it than children. ""Some famous or powerful people might not care,"" Dr Piyawat continued. ""But for others... what people say or do to them online, even a small message could be considered hurtful, regardless of their social status. ""The issue regarding sensitivity towards cyberbullying is highly individualised. Many, for example, have a stereotypical idea that people with sexual diversity are more sensitive. Actually, they are often tougher than others. No two persons are alike when it comes to how they are affected by negative criticism online. Rich or poor, anyone can be sensitive."" The effects of cyberbullying on victims can differ significantly, however. Some turn into bullies themselves. Others go in the opposite direction and become tougher and more defiant. The point of concern here, explains Dr Piyawat, is the significant emotional and psychological distress that develops as a result of cyberbullying. Especially among those already showing signs of psychological disorder or mental illness, hateful online messages can be the last straw, pushing them over the line, into aggression, agitation, depression, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or even suicide. ""This issue is one of responsibility, not only of the online community in general, but also the people surrounding individuals with mental conditions,"" Dr Piyawat said. ""If we are close to someone with a mental disorder, our job is to make sure they don't use social media too much. If we start to see signs that the situation is getting worse, we must try to pull them out of the virtual world. ""Cyberbullying can stimulate a deterioration of psychological symptoms. Even when patients are on proper medication, cyberbullying can still be a trigger that turns things from bad to worse."" The best protection against cyberbullying is disconnecting from the internet. This, of course, is much easier said than done. The internet is ubiquitous nowadays. And cyber literacy is crucial. ""When surfing the internet and web boards full of both constructive and destructive comments, users should draw a line to separate themselves from other people's business,"" Dr Piyawat said. ""Don't take people's issues as our own. Don't take everything too personally. ""If anyone feels they are being bombarded by comments and it starts to take a toll on their emotional state, the best way out is to stop reading them. Why suffer when we can choose to shut it down and ignore it?""",OVAC

											Browbeating bullies										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/1781299/browbeating-bullies,"I'm not a fan of any boy bands or girl groups from South Korea but I was shocked by the news of the death of Sulli that made big headlines in Thailand two weeks ago. I didn't know much about her before but the speculation that her sudden death was suicide and that cyberbullying may have been a contributing factor saddened me and made me curious to know what happened to her life. Sulli was a 25-year-old K-pop star who began acting professionally when at the age of 11 and made her singing debut with the famous girl group f(x) when she was 15. However, she left the band six years later to focus on her acting career, which saw her in a string of movies and TV series that earned her a New Star Award. In the middle of this year, she made her debut as a solo artist and launched a single album of her own. At a glance, Sulli seemed to be a young happy girl with a bright future in the South Korean entertainment world. But what she had to endure along the path as an entertainer was far from entertaining at all. In real life, she was a victim of what many have described as ""toxic fan culture"" where many stars are left defenceless while having to encounter hateful comments, malicious rumours and cyberbullying online. In the case of Sulli, some Korean critics have related her falling prey to such mean behaviour to her being an unconventional girl who dared to speak her mind and refused to conform with social norms in deeply conservative Korean society where celebrities are expected to be respectful and reserved. On the contrary, she was often seen to attract controversy with her dating, clothing choices and outspoken comments on feminism. At the height of her singing career five years ago, Sulli was caught having been in a relationship with her much older boyfriend and received many vicious comments and false rumours to the point where she reportedly suffered from stress-related pain and decided to take a break from the music industry. Their relationship ended three years later but the verbal violence against her online never stopped. Sulli then drew a bigger and longer round of heavy criticism when she posted on her Instagram pictures of herself wearing a shirt without a bra. Just recently, she insisted that going braless was one's freedom and she expressed her wish that people would discard their prejudices. Looking from the outside, Sulli seemed to be a defiant girl who didn't care much about the anonymous haters who kept insulting her on social media and spoke out strongly against it. But last year she revealed on a TV show that the online abuse had contributed to her panic disorder and social phobia that she had suffered since she was young. Sadly, not many knew that prior to her death, she was suffering from severe depression. In the wake of her death, many of her fans, friends and also celebrities have demanded a change in the anonymous comment culture on the Internet where users are allowed to leave comments without revealing their real names. Lawmakers in Korea are proposing a new bill, nicknamed ""Sulli's Law,"" with the aim to enforce strict rules against malicious comments under anonymous titles. No matter to the exact causes of her death, it feels awfully bad to see a young talented and beautiful woman mentally tormented because she was honest about her own views and thoughts. Her death is a wake-up call for her country to take cyberbullying more seriously. Cyberbullying has caused a big headache in many countries. Research has found that it can cause significant emotional and psychological distress to people from any age or walk of life. In Thailand, harsh comments are everywhere on social media, mostly targeting certain politicians and celebrities. I'm not worried about them at all as most are tough enough to ignore the remarks and, in many cases, ready to fight back. But my concern is on our young children who are growing with the cyber world and are naturally fragile to unkind words. I don't know what it takes to successfully stop cyberbullying even though there have been efforts by many parties concerned over the years to protect children from being bullied online. But I think that it's equally important to promote a new generation of netizens and implant in them a sense of respect from a young age. They should be taught to understand and accept each other's differences and show their disagreement in a reasonable manner. As long as they can learn to respect the differences of individuals, they would not easily harbour hatred towards others. Then, I believe they will grow up to be open-minded adults who will not cross the line to inflict pain on anyone. Patcharawalai Sanyanusin is a writer for Life section of the Bangkok Post.",OVAC

											Facebook hides 'likes' in Australian trial to ease anxiety										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/1759789/facebook-hides-likes-in-australian-trial-to-ease-anxiety,"SYDNEY: Facebook on Friday said it had begun hiding the number of ""likes"" for posts in Australia, a trial designed to ease social pressure that could be rolled out worldwide. Account holders across the country will also be blocked from viewing the number of reactions and video views on other people's posts from Friday, but will still be able to see how people respond to their own. ""We don't want Facebook to feel like a competition,"" the company said in a statement. ""This is a test to see how people engage with this new format."" ""We hope to learn from this over time in order to see if we will roll this out more broadly."" More than one billion people use Facebook worldwide, but the social media giant has come under pressure to combat the platform's impact on mental health. In Australia, one in five children report experiencing cyberbullying, according to the country's eSafety commissioner. The problem received national attention last year when a 14-year-old girl -- who starred in adverts of an iconic Australian hat brand -- killed herself after being bullied online. Facebook's decision comes after it launched a trial in July to hide ""likes"" on the company's other major social media platform, Instagram. What began as a test on Instagram in Canada was expanded to Australia, Brazil and several other major markets. The Facebook trial was described as ""a limited test in order for us to get some early learnings."" ""While this has been testing on Instagram, Facebook and (Instagram) are different surfaces and we will likely see different data come from this test."" The social media giant did not confirm how long the trial would run for. ""We want to understand from people whether removing the total counts improves their experience, while also not limiting any positive interactions,"" said Mia Garlick, of Facebook Australia.",OVAC

Manisha Dogra, vice-president for sustainability in Asia at Telenor, said the partnership is an important part of a global commitment to educate 4 million children across Telenor's markets on online safety by 2020. SafeInternetForKid.com is designed for children aged 7-16, their families and schools, featuring interactive games and downloadable resources. The website aims to foster young people's digital resilience, helping them understand when they are at risk online, know how to seek help, learn from the experience of being online and recover when things go wrong. DTAC chief executive Alexandra Reich said many young people are more tech-savvy than their parents, but that does not always mean they know how to stay safe. ""This is why DTAC has closely worked with Telenor Group to leverage the expertise of Parent Zone, the global experts in digital family life, to develop the website,"" Mrs Reich said. According to a survey of Thai children and online risk taken in November-December 2017 by Child Online Protection Action Thailand, Thai children aged 9-18 were exposed to online risks such as pornography (68.1%), cyberbullying (46.1%) and meeting people online (16%). DTAC is also working with academic institutes and Inskru, a startup that aims to empower young teachers in Thailand, to conduct both online and on-ground activities in relation to the safe online campaigns for teachers at the secondary education level and for 50,000 students in 400 schools nationwide this year. Depa president Nattapon Nimmanpatcharin said his agency has a Digital Manpower Fund that can be used as a mechanism to collaborate with other players to combat online risks and to improve Thailand's digital economy. DTAC, Depa and the Internet for Thailand Foundation have joined forces to usher in the Young Safe Internet Leader's Camp as a platform to enable youth to tackle online risks at schools, targeting students aged 12-15. At the camp, more than 200 youths and teachers will engage with experts to exchange constructive dialogue on initiatives to tackle online risks at school. The youth initiatives will be further developed into projects-in-action at schools with advice and financial support from DTAC and the Internet for Thailand Foundation. The first camp series will take place next month at DTAC House, Chamchuri Square.",OVAC

The digital world is a vast expanse of learning and entertainment, and it can expose kids to many risks such as cyberbullying, technology addiction and obscene and violent contents. Mr.Somchai Lertsutiwong, Chief Executive Officer at Advanced Info Service Public Limited Company or AIS, addressed the issue of cyber wellness at Aunjai Cyber project launch. “As a digital-life service provider, AIS looks at social development and impact in great depths. While continually advancing AIS digital platforms for Thailand’s competitiveness, we care about the wellbeing of Thai people particularly young children. They need to have digital skills to navigate safely and constructively in the digital world.  After reviewing cyber wellness practice in many countries, AIS selects DQ Institute in Singapore to offer DQ or Digital Intelligence Quotient to Thai children. DQ is the collection of social, emotional and cognitive abilities that enables individuals to deal with the challenges and demands of the digital life. DQ starts with eight-core digital citizenship skills: Digital Citizen Identity, Screen Time Management, Cyberbullying Management, Cyber Security Management, Digital Empathy, Digital Footprints, Critical Thinking and Privacy Management. Through DQ online learning platform, Thai children age 8-12 years old can self-learn DQ, become future-ready, smart and responsible digital citizen through fun and educational lessons. DQ is designed to empower children to be the master of technology, not its slave. Kids who have completed all DQ lessons will be more prudent, thinking before posting, questioning fake news, and knowing how to protect themselves against threats in social media.”  Mr. Somchai emphasized, “DQ is a good learning tool, but what more important is everyone must understand the essence of digital literacy. Each of us has responsibility to teaching and grooming our children to be digital citizen. AIS is committed to educating DQ program and forming human network comprising families, schools and organizations working together to reinforce ethic and values to our children. All kids are welcome to test their DQ free of charge. I encourage parents and teachers to #DQYourChild for their digital literacy which will pave way to the sustainability of Thai society in the future.”            ",OVAC

But with increased access to the internet comes problems ranging from security threats to cyberbullying. Israeli software company Check Point has developed a Chrome extension called SandBlast to mitigate these threats facing school-aged youngsters. The extension not only beefs up cybersecurity on Chromebooks, but it also tackles the bullying problem by blocking keywords and issuing alerts to students before they post offensive content. ""SandBlast for Education monitors and controls browsing activity by using advanced, dynamic and highly accurate URL filtering capabilities with granular whitelisting and blacklisting capabilities,"" said Bruce Chai, head of threat prevention at Check Point Asia. ""It blocks explicit search results by enforcing safe-search capabilities in Google, Yahoo, Bing and YouTube, and can block access to other search engines."" A study in the US found that nearly 90% of students aged 4 to 12 had witnessed their peers get cyberbullied, while over 90% of children aged 8 to 16 had been exposed to internet pornography. The SandBlast technology differs from leading competitors by providing protection against threats where a signature is not available and protecting students even when they take their Chromebook outside the school's defence network. ""Looking at schools who have deployed Chromebooks for their students, we found that there was a gap in how those devices were being secured against the evolving threats landscape,"" Mr Chai said. ""Using technologies which were first developed and proven at protecting large-scale enterprises, we have since adopted these same technologies for protecting students."" The program also protects against phishing attacks and malicious files, and automatically cleans up downloaded documents with potentially harmful content.",OVAC

The move aims to create safe and informed internet users, teaching at least 2,000 students by mid-2020. Under the scheme, Line will translate its original educational materials developed in Japan in 2014 into Thai and localise them for Thailand. The material is in PDF format, together with an instruction manual, and can be downloaded from Line's website for free. ETDA president Surangkana Wayuparb said the collaboration with Line Corp will complement two of the ETDA's core programmes for digital literacy: Internet for a Better Life and School Camp. Mrs Surangkana said that the government, through the Digital Economy and Society Ministry, is concerned with the growing sophistication of cyberthreats in people's daily lives, especially for children and elderly people who use social media. ""Students play an important role in shaping the future of our country and they will be key conductors, effectively teaching their parents to use social media and the internet,"" she said. According to an ETDA report, 33% of those affected by cyberthreats use the internet and social media recklessly. Youths below 17 spend an average of 5.48 hours on the internet every weekday and 7.12 hours a day at the weekend. Using social media is the top online activity. There are several types of online threats, including cyberbullying, fraud, obscene material and child abuse. Mrs Surangkana said the collaboration with Line Corp will ease the government's target of raising the digital literacy of internet users in line with the Thailand 4.0 policy. The MoU includes collaboration between the two parties through different programmes, including research and development for educational materials on internet safety, workshops and seminars that raise awareness of digital literacy needs at schools and other institutes, and sharing knowledge and interacting with individuals in terms of internet safety. Line Corp has been developing digital literacy programmes designed to promote internet safety since April 2014. The materials have been widely used at educational institutes around Japan, with 2,500 workshops and lectures held last year alone.

											Online safety for children is everyone's responsibility										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/1459937/online-safety-for-children-is-everyones-responsibility,"Shutting children away behind closed doors, away from prying eyes and with no internet, can protect them up to a point. But preventing children from engaging with the world hurts their development in the long run. Children need fair, proper and manageable protection from online harm, and that requires collaboration between children, parents, society, businesses and the government, say experts who spoke at a recent event held by the Thai Electronic Transactions Development Agency. Messenger Kids, introduced by Facebook for children as young as six years, was among the topics discussed. A Facebook representative at the event declined to comment, but Andrea Hargrave, director-general of the London-based International Institute of Communications, said applications designed especially for children are not a bad idea in themselves. But business is business, and that's where things get tricky. ""I am sure [products specialised for children] are helpful because they allow children to communicate within a safe space that you know you can trust, like Disney,"" she told Asia Focus. ""But the point is, somebody is obviously making money out of this and they are making money out of your kids' data. ""Parents are caught between a rock and a hard place but you don't just stop them from using [the internet] completely because I don't think you would want to do that. Just as children need to learn how to cross the road, they need to learn how to navigate the digital world."" Many of the efforts related to child safety come from the traditional media content world, which is accustomed to regulation in various forms, but ""this is a different world"", she said. ""We all have to take more responsibility as parents than we have in the past. We need to collaborate and work with industries because industries want you to buy their products and if you walk away from their products, they do not have a business anymore. And that is why Facebook has taken on a number of moderators."" Even though the IT giants are making money from specialised products for children through advertising and selling of data, they are trying to help parents at least understand what they can do to mitigate some of the bigger risks, she said. Kaspersky Lab, a multinational cybersecurity provider, identifies seven dangers that children face online: cyberbullying, cyber predators, posting private information, phishing (emails that try to trick people into clicking on malicious links), falling for scams, accidentally downloading malware, and posts that come back to haunt a child later in life since deleting something forever from the internet is nearly impossible. Kaspersky recommends that parents talk more to their children about what is happening in their lives so they can be alert to bullying or predators. They should remind them that mum and dad can see what they post online, but that they ""don't snoop"". Children can be told about how people can steal private information such as a home address for malicious purposes. Even though your children are smart enough not to send money to Nigerian princes, they might fall for scams that offer things they may want, such as free access to online games in return for parents' credit card information, according to Kaspersky. Parents need to deliver the age-old caution to children about offers that sound too good to be true. Ms Hargrave agrees that safety starts with talking to children, but monitoring their use of devices is difficult. ""For example, is your child allowed to take an iPad to bed because they want to play some games? And at what age do you give your child a smartphone?"" In the UK, many children are allowed to independently use smartphones when they reach secondary school because they are travelling on their own to school. But increasingly, younger children are getting smartphones because of ""peer pressure"" that parents should try to resist, she said. The formal education system also has a role to play. ""I think that in Thailand you have enormous opportunity. It is a country that respects teachers and learning and I also think teachers need to be helped to understand what the issues are in the way that parents do."" Canada and Singapore, in her view, are the most advanced countries in terms of media literacy. In Singapore, experts have been teaching safe use of the internet in schools for two decades. Parents' associations often discuss online safety. ""I am sure you can do something like that here,"" she said. Because private companies are the ""gatekeepers"" of the internet, the public should be able to trust them to deal with some of the problems that arise, said Dr Joan Barata, founder of the Vienna-based consultancy CommVisions. ""On the other hand, I also believe that in order to perform that important task, these private companies need direction from the government because in some cases, government institutions ... are better suited to define what is in the public interest or what is acceptable and what is not,"" he said. In addition to heeding guidance from public bodies, private companies need input from parents and civil society organisations on community standards. ""In many cases you cannot have just one petrified code, but more like a set of rules that needs to be able to adapt to circumstances. In many cases, only thanks to feedback can you know that you are doing your work properly and make good judgements,"" said Dr Barata. Dr Masato Kajimoto, a journalism professor and founder of the Asia Pacific Digital Citizens Network, favours educating children in media literacy over heavy regulation. Children can be taught how to self-regulate, he said, based on what seems to be working in Japan, where media literacy is part of the public school curriculum. ""My recommendation is to find a way for media literacy education to be integrated into the public education system in one way or another. It could be just 15 minutes every two weeks for those aged between 7 and 17,"" he told Asia Focus. For the younger age group, Dr Kajimoto recommends teaching empathy and ethical behaviour to reduce cyberbullying. Older children can be taught to think more analytically about content by answering questions. On seeing a popular TV show, for example, they could be asked: why do you think this drama is popular, why was it created, why does it appeal emotionally? ""What we do with high school and university students is almost pure journalism, including fact checking and verification, and the same thing can be done for entertainment content but slightly different because it is mostly made up,"" he said. ""These kinds of analyses of media content could probably help them develop critical thinking skills that they could use to protect themselves from cyber harm.""",OVAC

The guidelines will be sourced from a best practices and global policies exchange at the country’s first international conference on “Building a Safe Online Environment for Children”, hosted by the Electronic Transactions Development Agency (ETDA) during Feb 8-9. Expected to be effective by mid-year, the measures are seen as a complement to the ETDA’s “Internet for a Better Life” project that was implemented in 2016 to create awareness of online safety via training courses, media and digital contents. DE Minister Pichet Durongkaveroj said the guidelines need to be jointly developed by the DE Ministry and other agencies such as the Education Ministry and the Social Development and Human Security Ministry, as well as local communities nationwide. Mr Pichet was a key speaker at the conference yesterday alongside several renowned figures such as executives from Facebook, Google and 3DU Play, media experts, and academics from international institutions. According to the ETDA’s latest report on internet user behaviour, young people below the age of 17 on average spend 5.48 hours per day on the internet during the week and 7.12 hours on the weekend. The top online activity is social media. This has increased the opportunity and occurrence of several types of online threats, including cyberbullying, deceit, obscenity and child abuse. Reckless online usage can also bring about other harms, such as privacy breaches. “The important issue is how to make the internet a safe place protecting children from abusive and harmful content,” Mr Pichet said. “The measures or guidelines to create awareness must be constructive rather than strict regulations alone.” Mr Pichet said the international conference marked the first time that Thailand had addressed the problems of the online ecosystem, regarding children in particular, aimed at sharing experiences, best practices and ideas on policies and regulations. ETDA president Surangkana Wayuparb said the “Internet for a Better Life” project has provided training courses for digital use and awareness of threats to some 2,000 children. The upcoming guidelines will help generate greater measures for the ETDA and related agencies to implement positive ways to build a safe online environment. “Building a safe online ecosystem needs local and global attention,” she said, adding that in many countries officials use the legal processes to effectively protect children. Thailand recently revised the penal code to impose sanctions on possession of media that displays children obscenely, for which online media is included.

											The dark web										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/tech/1272735/the-dark-web,"Mobile phones have increasingly become children's primary access point to the internet and almost 100% of the devices are smartphones -- with children exposed to cyberbullying on social media. ""Cyberbullying is correlated to the use of social media. The more children are exposed to social media, the more risk they are subject to,"" said Assoc Prof Chanvit Pornnoppadol, head of division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University at a recent panel discussion entitled ""Stop Bullying"", organised by DTAC. Children's privacy should therefore be protected, and parents and teachers should be educated about this. Chanvit suggested a ""zero tolerance bullying"" policy as an approach that schools should implement in order to prevent cyberbullying. According to Chanvit, zero tolerance means an almost ideal society where cyberbullying issues are solved or lessened in severity. ""Schools abroad have their students subscribe to LinkedIn [a business-oriented professional social network platform] instead of other social media, as it's one way to protect the students' privacy. The more they are exposed to social media, the more they open their privacy to the public,"" said Chanvit. Citing preliminary research entitled ""The Frequency And Factors Of Cyberbullying Among Youths At Mathayom 1-3"" conducted by Mahidol University in collaboration with 14 countries, Chanvit said almost 80% of Thai children have been bullied. Of this number, 66% were bullied at least once a week, and 12% every day. Furthermore, 45% have been cyberbullied at least once, which is four times more than children in the US, Europe and Japan. Based on the report, he pointed out that friends are the most influential group in early adolescence (children aged 13-15). For secondary school students, peer acceptance is important. At this age, they begin to stay away from their parents. Once they are bullied and not accepted by friends, they potentially become lonely and isolated. They are also likely to become absent at school, lack focus and may have drug issues or self-harm. In Thailand, the team from Mahidol conducted the survey with some 3,000 adolescents in four schools and the results largely correlated with the other 14 countries. The one-month survey found that students spend 5.5 hours a day dealing with social media. The study also found that more than half of the surveyed students confirmed they accepted Facebook ""friend requests"" after only seeing a profile picture. To prevent cyberbullying, parents should observe personality changes in their children, particularly if they are isolating themselves, seem depressed and don't want to go to school. Cyberbullying is very much more harmful than it was in the past, Chanvit said. Thai youths have not realised that they are at risk of cyberbullying because of their digital behaviour. The cases in Thailand may not be as severe as those abroad, but cyberbullying is likely to cause young people to become uncomfortable and stressed, while adults may not even realise this. Chanvit said collaboration is key in tackling cyberbullying. Apart from the Ministry of Education, school teachers should be at the forefront of directly interacting with students and raising awareness regarding the importance of this issue. Teachers and parents should have an attitude of supporting, not blaming. ""Bullying stems from home and it becomes disclosed at school. If parents use violence with their kids, they will also use violence at school,"" said Thawatchai Pachun, project leader of Stop Bullying, Path2Health foundation. The foundation is now working with DTAC on its Stop Bullying campaign for children below the age of 18 who are bullied, either online or offline, every day from 4pm to midnight. The Stop Bullying chat room, a collaborative project between DTAC and P2H, has been launched. A pilot service of this chat room is now open and will be completed by February next year. Tipawan Buranasin, child and adolescent psychiatrist at Child and Adolescent Mental Health, Rajanagarindra Institute, noted that a quarter of children have been bullied and 50% of the kids have a problem due to bullying at schools and in the cyberworld. The institute provides a 24-hour mental health hotline. The service has evolved from addressing social media and game addiction to include cyberbullying. Internet and game addiction among youths is ranked the second most commonly found problem for teens, only after love and sex issues. Cyberbullying can also lead to chronic mental health problems and stress-related disorders. Onuma Rerkpattanapipat, head of corporate communications and sustainability at DTAC, said 20% of its subscribers are children and the company has encouraged wider society to help equip them with knowledge about using the internet safely.",OVAC

											A safer internet for children										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/1163049/a-safer-internet-for-children,"The internet is an extraordinarily powerful tool but unsupervised use in the hands of children can lead to devastating consequences. Curiosity can get the better of them, even when their intention is entirely innocent -- searching for a favourite band on YouTube for example. Further searches sometimes lead down a very dark path. In addition to being exposed to disturbing content, some children unwittingly become victims of online pornographers and traffickers. Parents are at their wits' end in their attempts to remain a step ahead of predators on the lookout for their next victim. If we profess that children are our greatest resource, the future of our country, we must prioritise their well-being, to the point of placing it on the national agenda if need be. Driving home this point recently were experts in the field of child services and information and communications technology (ICT) at the eighth biennial international consultation of Child Helpline International in Bangkok. This diverse array of stakeholders and child protection advocates from more than 100 countries pooled their knowledge in an attempt to create a real, sustainable and lasting impact on young lives. While discussions touched on areas pertaining to combating all types of violence against children and gender inequality, a lot of time was devoted to the role of ICT. A workshop by Facebook, for example, focused on different approaches to help children be safe online. Mofya Chisala, director of the ICT regulator in Zambia, spoke of more tangible ways to address the dangers the internet can pose. He suggested sharing valuable experiences with people in the field, so precious time is not wasted during a crisis. While the problems children face with the internet are similar across the world, the right methods of addressing them are of utmost importance; what works in the African context might not necessarily work as well in Asia or other regions. The most obvious dangers of the internet for young people involve pornography, he said. Cyberbullying has also become a major concern. Mr Chisala noted that internet predators are expert manipulators, able to foster a relationship of dependence with a teenager. Social networks such as Facebook thus need to be monitored, and parents need to be aware of the influences their children absorb online, he said. Mr Chisala favours the development of a broad database, where child helpline agencies can pool their experiences so that when an issue arises, they can have quick access to successful solutions. He said it was a waste of time reinventing methodologies when others had already developed them, so everyone in the field should learn from others' experiences as well as share their own. This, I believe, hit the nail on the head when it came to expeditiously working to help a victim and bring perpetrators to justice. We might come from different countries, but because we live in one world, our children need to be protected no matter where they happen to be. Mr Chisala's strategy can definitely benefit Thailand, where we tend to waste a lot of precious time searching for solutions and putting them in place, instead of first looking around to see how others have addressed similar cases. On a positive note, I have to commend our own ICT experts for making strides of their own to curb the movement of online perpetrators; however, there is still a lot left to accomplish. Laws have to be strictly implemented. For example, internet cafe owners have to be held accountable for allowing underage patrons to access content that could put them in imminent danger. I would even go so far as to suggest partitioning an area where children under age 18 can use computers that allow access only to material compatible for their age. Parents and communities have to also band together to keep children's best interests at heart. Mobile phone use in particular needs closer supervision now that the handset is becoming the first-choice gateway to the online world. Adults, including relatives, family friends and teachers, also need to make more time in their busy schedules to listen to youngsters. As minors, they are sitting targets for internet predators, especially when the child has no one to speak with. Remember the good old days when parents spoke with their children around the dinner table or before bedtime? It's not just a great way to connect with one's child but also helps keep them safe from impending danger. Wouldn't you agree?",OVAC

She felt depressed and embarrassed. Shortly after the episode ended, Pantip chat room was overloaded with comments from viewers, mostly teenagers. Some confided that they were also victims of cyberbullies. One comment noted that cyberbullying is common among children and teenagers because they are obsessed with social media. ""The drama presents the reality through the character of Minni,"" one comment read. TEENAGE TROUBLES Reality on TV: Minni, a character from the hit TV show 'Wai Sab Saraek Kad', is a net idol who became a victim of cyberbullying after a naked photo was shared online. Photos: BKK Post Archive ""The series was popular because it talked about issues of adolescence that Thai adults fail to pay attention to,"" said assistant professor Wimontip Musikaphan of the National Institute for Child and Family Development at Mahidol University. ""It is serious but adults have not realised the severity of the problem. They think it is a kind of teasing."" Ms Wimontip, who has supervised research and thesis work on cyberbullying for five years, says it has many adverse effects, especially for adolescents who tend to seek acceptance from their peers and society. Peer exclusion plays an important role. If the bullying victim feels ashamed or excluded, it can trigger impulsive actions such as suicide, she added. ""They don't realise that cyberbullying can leave a lasting impact on the victims because it is repetitive. You cannot avoid it."" In research co-written with academic Nanthanat Songsiri, she cited examples from other countries where cyberbullying has already claimed young lives as a warning for Thai agencies to look seriously into the issue. In 2003, Ryan Halligan, a 13-year-old American, was teased for several months after his classmates spread a rumour via online chat forums that he was gay. One popular female classmate pretended to like Ryan and chatted with him via the internet. Later, she forwarded all the chats to her friends. Ryan could not stand the humiliation and committed suicide. In 2007, an 18-year-old Japanese student committed suicide by jumping from a school building in Kobe because her classmate posted nude pictures of her on an unauthorised website and extorted money from her. Ms Wimontip also cited a 2009 incident in Thailand when a girl had to drop out of school after a clip showing her being sexually assaulted was circulated online. In the clip, a high school girl wearing a girl guide uniform holds the girl down while she is raped by her boyfriend wearing a boy scout uniform. ""All in all, the victims of cyberbullying feel shamed and stressed with feelings of victimisation, leading to dropping out of school and negative impacts on their mental health,"" she said. She said there has yet to be a documented case of cyberbullying in Thailand leading >> >> to suicide. But she said this is no cause to celebrate. ""Very few students come to seek help when they are bullied."" Research shows the number of adolescents experiencing cyberbullying in Thailand is rising every year. Ms Wimontip said a study undertaken in 2013 showed 30-40% of adolescents said they had been involved with a cyberbully, either as the victim or perpetrator. The number rose to 50% a year later. ""One of the recent studies by my students shows that it has also started at primary level,"" she said, citing yet-to-be published research that showed about five out of 100 Grade 4 and Grade 5 students had been involved in cyberbullying. ""We had to spend time asking them because in many cases the children did not realise that the treatment was cyberbullying,"" she added. The research also indicated that family background can make children more likely to be online aggressors. ""Children who did not receive proper attention from their parents have more tendency to attack other people on social media. It is a way for them to vent their personal anger and frustration,"" she said. THE WILD, WILD WEB Bullying happens in school when children lack adult supervision. It is a form of power play in which an aggressor deliberately targets a victim. A cheering crowd can encourage the bully because they perceive his or her actions to be ""heroic"". Llong view: Wimontip Musikaphan has researched cyberbullying for more than five years. Photo: Courtesy of Wimontip Musikaphan When traditional bullying happens, teachers or parents can see the effects more easily, such as bruises or wounds left on the victim. Promboon Panitchpakdi, executive director of the Raks Thai Foundation, says the behaviour of cyberbullies is similar to that of physical bullies. Although the victim may not be physically hurt, the bully uses social media to mentally and emotionally harm the victim. The cheering tribe participate by adding mean remarks to deepen the wound. In most cases, the victims are targeted because they may look different. The aggressor selects the victim because he or she knows the victim is vulnerable. Mr Promboon cited the case of an autistic student whose classmates posted messages on his Facebook page stating that he was stupid. The negative comments that followed were unbearable for the student to read. ""The internet and Line are vulnerable spaces because they can reach people 24 hours, seven days a week. You cannot avoid it. If you see the notifications on Facebook, you want to know why people tag your name,"" he said. Mr Promboon said that while teachers or other supervisors can help victims when they see physical bullying, only a small number of cyberbullying victims report their cases because they are ashamed. With cyberbullying, they can hide their hurt more easily. ""In most cases, the bullied student would rather confide in their siblings than their parents,"" he said. Raks Thai Foundation has carried out activities in school to teach students about life skills and respect. ""We have taught them since Grade 3 and Grade 4 that cyberbullying is not a heroic act,"" he said. ""People who bully other people tend to be insecure and they bully others to conceal their complexes."" Unfortunately, Thai adults have not yet realised the seriousness of the issue. This is partly because in the Thai language ""bully"" is the same word as ""tease"". ""Adults tend to think when someone pokes fun at you on the internet, what's the big deal,"" Mr Promboon said. Adults do not understand that the mental anguish can last longer. ""Although they do not physically face each other, cyberbullying is comparable to psychological warfare to hurt people,"" he said. ANONYMOUS AGGRESSORS Assistant professor Ruthaychonnee Sittichai, a lecturer in the humanities and social sciences faculty at Prince of Songkla University, studied cyberbullying in the deep South in 2014. Her survey showed that students were exposed to cyberbullying just as much as other young people around the world. Same everywhere: Ruthaychonnee Sittichai examined cyberbullying in the south. Photo: Courtesy of Ruthaychonnee Sittichai The sample survey comprised 1,200 students, 57% female and 43% male. Most were Muslim from Pattani, Narathiwat and Yala. The samples were collected from Grade 7 to 12. About 86% of students owned a mobile phone, half of which were smartphones. Ms Ruthaychonnee said most students were exposed to cyberbullying as 86% of them had been online. Of the 60% of students who had access to the internet at home, more than half had access to the internet for 0-5 hours per week, while only 6% had access to the internet for 20 hours or more per week. The survey also found that the prevalence rates for traditional and online victimisation were roughly 6% and 3.7% respectively using strict criteria, and 16% and 15% using more lenient criteria. These figures are fairly similar to those found in many Western countries, according to a European Union survey in 2010. Although the overall prevalence of bullying is not so different, there does seem to be a relatively high ratio of cyber to traditional victimisation in southern Thailand, she said. In Western countries, cyberbullying rates often make up one-third of traditional victimisation. However, southern Thailand has a higher proportion of online victims relative to traditional victims. ""Cyberbullying is an important issue to be addressed among young people in Thailand,"" Ms Ruthaychonnee said. ""It is easier for some students to do this. The aggressors can be anonymous. In one case, we found the aggressor was a quiet boy sitting at the back of the class. Cyberbullying showed his dark side,"" she said. The study showed that half of the victims were not physically bullied, which is quite a high proportion in comparison to other studies. It also revealed that male students are more involved in cyberbullying in the deep South. Male students spent more time surfing the net and playing games, which may lead to more cyberbullying. Female students spent more time on the internet for schoolwork and Facebook. Ms Ruthaychonnee said the survey showed that grade, religion and province were insignificant factors in cyberbullying. But victims tend to be different from the crowd, such as students whose parents have a higher education level. ""Children with highly educated parents were more likely to experience cyberbullying once or twice but were not at greater risk of severe victimisation,"" she said. FACING UP Feeling the pain: Petrol station attendant Nong Namtao became an unwitting victim after her appearance was criticised. Photo: BKK Post Archive Miss A is the administrator of the Stop Bullying Thailand Facebook page. ""I set up the page to provide information about cyberbullying because I was a victim myself,"" the administrator told Spectrum. When she was a student, she made an online comment on a certain post about an issue that she would rather not reveal. She proceeded to get harsh responses from her friends and classmates. The message was shared to others who had a different opinion from her. ""I was surprised by the response. I just told people what I thought. But the responses were too mean. One of them was even my classmate and she acted like nothing happened,"" she said. The administrator dealt with the fight by setting up the Facebook page to gather people's experiences of being hurt or victimised by social media messages, with the goal of educating the public about the issue. Posts include the recent high-profile case of Pongsak Kensing, a Yasothon civil servant who posted photos of a petrol station attendant on his Facebook page accompanied by a condescending message about the young woman he had never even met. After the post was circulated, netizens got angry. Some even visited the PTT station in Maha Chana Chai to show support for Nong Namtao, the victim of the photos. They said that Nong Namtao broke down in tears when she was made aware of the post. The civil servant had to apologise to Nong Namtao, largely due to pressure from the social media community. The latest post on Stop Bullying Thailand features the recent case of a woman who took a candid photo of Pol Lt Pramote Trakulwangthong, a 57-year-old traffic policeman in Trang. She had criticised his looks and said: ""What species is this?"" Pol Lt Pramote said he was not aware of the post because he did not use social media. However, he later learned about it after his friends and children showed it to him. After netizens learned of the incident, they criticised the woman for her hurtful words. The woman later apologised to Pol Lt Pramote in person. But the policeman did not seem to care much. ""I just wanted to tell her to imagine if this happened to her relatives or siblings,"" he said. The two cases may not fit the typical description of cyberbullying because they are one-off incidents, but both victims suffered hurt, especially Nong Namtao. Miss A says the cases are good examples of how netizens can also play their part by putting pressure on aggressors to stop online abuse.

											When school isn’t safe										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/special-reports/821076/when-school-isn-t-safe,"Bung* is in Mathayom 3 and is counting down the days until he can leave and finally join a school where male students are in the minority. “Three more months in hell,” Bung says hopefully. Bung is now enrolled at one of the most popular schools in southern Thailand. The 15-year-old self-identifies as a young katoey, has a small build and acts in a very feminine manner. Bung moved to the school almost three years ago and is in the elite academic stream. “I have no problem in the classroom because all my friends focus on studying,” Bung explained. “But as soon as I walk out of class, I get harassed by the boys. They’ve never hurt me physically, but I’ve been traumatised by the verbal and sexual abuse.” Bung is one of many high school students who experience bullying in what is supposed to be one of the safest places for children. Thailand has a reputation for being open to the LGBT community, but research has dispelled this myth, especially when it comes to the school environment. THE DISTURBING TRUTH Associate professor Pimpawun Boonmongkon, who heads the Centre for Health Policy Studies at Mahidol University, is always looking for ways to improve young people’s lives. Ms Pimpawun, who has a special interest in child development and education, has been researching obstacles to learning, in the hope her work can be used to improve children’s experience of school. She has found one of the main things that interferes with a child’s education is bullying, especially among LGBT students at secondary level. Ms Pimpawun’s team conducted research across Bangkok and the central, northern, northeastern and southern regions in 2012 and 2013. A total of 2,070 students participated, with 246 — more than 10% — identifying as LGBT. The research found that 11.3% of non-LGBT students were bullied physically, 12.9% verbally, 13% socially, and 7.7% sexually. But the LGBT students faced much higher incidences of attacks. At least 30% were bullied physically, 29.3% verbally, 36.4% socially and 24.4% sexually. When the numbers were broken down by region, Ms Pimpawun said the South, which is known for being socially conservative, was where the most bullying occurred. “Southern culture is a male dominant culture,” she said. “Therefore they have less sympathy and tolerance towards LGBT people. The northern region is more tolerant when it comes to LGBT acceptance.” Bung, who studies in the South, has had been subjected to weekly harassment from boys at school since he was in Mathayom 1. Bung was once pulled into a classroom by a group of boys while the teenager was walking to submit homework to a teacher. “They grabbed my chest, my bottom and my penis. Then they stripped me to see if I had boobs like a girl,” Bung said. “I was very close to leaving school but my mum told me to put up with the bullying and wait. She told me it would get better when I get older.” WIDESPREAD ABUSE Ms Pimpawun’s research helped inform a wider regional report on school bullying, sexual orientation and gender identity, called From Insult to Inclusion, published by Unesco at the end of last year. Justine Sass, a regional education adviser at Unesco Bangkok, told Spectrum school should be the most protective environment for students and a place where parents feel comfortable sending their children. Zero tolerance: Pibool Uppatham director Somsak Swaengkarn wants to wipe out bullying. But according to the Unesco report, more than half (56%) of young LGBT people in Thailand are bullied every month, while nearly a third experience physical abuse (31%) and verbal abuse (29%); and almost one quarter (24%) are victims of sexual harassment. Another study found discrimination, violence and exclusion in education often follows LGBT young people into the workforce. Bullying can occur in the playground, in toilets, changing rooms or classrooms, or on the way to and from school. It may also extend to virtual spaces through cyberbullying, which is an increasing concern given widespread internet access, particularly through mobile phones. A worldwide study of 7,644 young people aged eight to 17 years old in 25 countries showed cyberbullying was widespread. Of the 25 countries surveyed, the three in which participants reported the highest rates of online bullying were in Asia: China with 70%, Singapore with 58%, and India with 53%. Other Asian countries in the study reported lower levels of 33% in Malaysia, 26% in Pakistan and 17% in Japan. “Online bullying is worse than actual physical bullying. When a child is bullied at school, it ends at school. But online bullying exists in the cyber world for a very long time, and can come back to hurt those who are bullied later,” Ms Sass said. POWER, NOT PLAY While Ms Pimpawun’s research focused on young LGBT people, Thawatchai Pachun, a project leader from the Path2Health Foundation, warns bullying affects all kinds of students equally. The Path2Health Foundation runs anti-bullying campaigns in many secondary schools and works directly with child victims. “Our experience shows anyone can be bullied, regardless of their gender or sexual orientation,” Mr Thawatchai said. Somsak Swaengkarn, director of Pibool Uppatham School in Huai Khwang, Bangkok, has been a head teacher for more than a decade. He has worked in many schools: all boys, all girls and mixed. Each has their own problems, he said. “Single gender schools tend to have less problems than mixed gender schools,” Mr Somsak said. “Sometimes the bullying victims are non-LGBT kids and those who bully them are LGBT kids. It’s all about power and how they manipulate that.” Mr Thawatchai said potential victims include children with special needs, new students, quiet children who don’t have many friends, young people with something outstanding about their physical appearance (such as being fat or thin, dark skinned or tall), nerdy students, LGBT youth and children from wealthy backgrounds. “I read some research that found children who are bullied in school are 10 times more likely to grow up to become murderers,” Mr Thawatchai said. “If we can create a safer school environment for students, then we’ll have better quality adults in the future.” At another secondary school in the heart of Bangkok, one Mathayom 1 boy who enrolled this semester separates himself from everyone else. He can’t get along with the other pupils and has only a few friends. Once a week, a group of older students tease him, patting him on the head and demanding money. The boy gives them 10 or 20 baht to protect himself, but that doesn’t guarantee his safety. “One time I didn’t give them enough money. They hit me in the head and took my wallet. I was too afraid to tell my teacher or mum,” said the boy, who didn’t want to be named. STUDENT ARMY During lunchtime at Pibool Uppatham School, more than 2,000 students are enjoying their break from classes. From kindergarten level to Mathayom 6, there are enough of them to fill the school yard. But among all the pupils, there are 30 with an important job. They wear regular school uniform, but with a special armband. It reads “Anti-Bullying Team” and marks them out as part of a team charged with keeping the students in order. “I am part of the student committee and part of my responsibility is to make sure that every student feels safe to come to school,” said Mathayom 5 student and squad member Nithima Namtanchuan. “It was our director Ajarn Somsak’s idea to create the team to help monitor the school, since we know more students on a more personal level than he does,” she added proudly. “We don’t have that much of a bullying problem in our school,” Ticha Wongparwed, a Mathayom 4 student explained. “But I hope there will be zero bullying with hard work and effort from us and our teachers.” Wannisa Pikuntong, the school counsellor, told Spectrum the school’s anti-bullying campaign has been running for one month. Those who feel threatened by other students can write anonymous complaint cards and put them into a box. The anti-bullying squad then read the cards and consult her about any problems. “The student committee has a closer relationship to their peers than teachers. I tend to guide the team on how to consult the students. If they get out of their depth, I step in to help,” Mrs Wannisa said. Mr Somsak hopes to bring the bullying rate in his school down to zero within four years. “Besides working with the students, we also want to get parents involved with the campaign. We’ve had some incidents when fights between students were encouraged by parents,” Mr Somsak said. Since the project is new, not every student has benefitted, such as one Mathayom 3 boy who identified himself as a young katoey. He told Spectrum he still gets physically bullied by boys at school and no one seems to care. “I get punched all the time. I know I am not a beautiful katoey like others at school. I am fat and have dark skin, at least that’s what they say. They call me a big, black, ugly katoey,” he said. BOY ON FIRE While Pibool Uppatham School has its anti-bullying squad, Taweethapisek School in Bangkok Yai district is doing things differently. The all-boys school, for pupils from Mathayom 1 to 6, has been raising awareness through a short film project. Budding film-makers: The pupils from Taweethapisek School who made ‘Piratch, the Boy on Fire’. Pimonmart Putsamond, Taweethapisek’s vice-director, said the school has always been a place for gentlemen, with a long history since King Rama V. To honour this tradition, they are teaching students to respect one another like true gentlemen. “We do have some bullying in our school, just like all schools. But our problems are not serious. We know how to manage our students well,” Ms Pimonmart said. “Katoey students here are not the target. New students are more likely to be victims.” Students at the school were invited to enter a competition to make a short film promoting the anti-bullying message. Many teams competed, but the winners impressed with a story about how bullying affected two young men — a gay student and a new student. “I think gay kids and new kids are easy targets for bullies. So I used them as the main characters,” said the director of the film, Tattaporn Deethaworn. The film, called Piratch, the Boy on Fire, focuses on a gay student who is bullied for his sexual orientation by a group of boys. One day a new student comes to talk to him and they hit it off. The two date for a while, until the gay boy finds out that the new student was sent by the bullies, and had tricked him into falling in love. BEFORE IT’S TOO LATE Last year the Raks Thai Foundation found bullying affected between 20% and 30% of students who took part in focus groups at 30 elementary schools across the country. Executive director Promboon Panitchpakdi said the foundation targets its support services at small elementary schools, since “we assume big schools already have counsellors to help students”. Mr Promboon said making the distinction between teasing and bullying is important. Teasing is less persistent, but bullying is when a child is the victim of repeated physical or mental abuse at the hands of others. The foundation used different techniques to ask students about their experience of bullying, including getting them to draw pictures. They asked whether they had been bullied, if they had bullied someone, if they had seen a student being bullied and done nothing, or if they had cheered on while another student was bullied. Schools in different locations yielded different results. Students at schools in border areas, for example, were more likely to be bullied because of ethnic differences, such as accent or skin colour. But there were also universal cases of victims who stuttered or were bad at sports, students who wore thick-rimmed glasses and overweight children. Some pupils said they no longer wanted to attend school because of their experiences. “Things can get better once children grow up, but there may be a long-term effect on the self-esteem of some victims,” Mr Promboon said. Bullying related to gender and sexuality is serious because it can compromise a child’s development and leave them with negative perceptions of themselves that persist into adult life. “Our findings were surprising,” Mr Promboon said. “We didn’t think we would see this kind of bullying at elementary level.” Some pupils were bullied because they seemed to be “gay”, while pre-teen female students were targeted for starting puberty early. “Some adults may dismiss the behaviour as childish teasing,” Mr Promboon said. “But the victim feels very bad. We had a girl who was maturing faster than others and was verbally teased by boys who also tried to touch her body repeatedly. If we let this behaviour carry on, the male students grow up with the belief that it is OK to bully a woman. It contributes to gender inequality. “We target elementary students because it will be too late to change their behaviour once they go to middle school.” Getting pupils to take an active role in stopping bullying is key, he said. “The students who see others being bullied should feel the urge to help. It is a basic principle that children need to understand to live in a peaceful society. But some prefer to stay quiet.” As well as the focus groups, the Raks Thai Foundation conducted training with parents, to teach them how to help their children cope with bullying. “Some parents pay little attention to bullying because they think it’s a childish matter. But they must realise that victims can go through years of living in misery. It can have a lasting impact on both the bullies and victims. We have to pay attention to the way children treat each other in the same way we do for adults.” * Names have been changed. Handheld vice: Bullying often takes place in the playground, or on the way to and from school, but these days it also extends to virtual spaces, given widespread internet access through mobile phones. Dedicated: Pibool Uppatham school counsellor Wannisa Pikuntong helps students protect each other. Keeping order: During lunch at Pibool Uppatham School, more than 2,000 students enjoy their break. Among them, 30 are part of an anti-bullying squad.

											Together, we must stop the scourge of cyberbullying										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/820608/together-we-must-stop-the-scourge-of-cyberbullying,"Thailand’s internet penetration rate is ranked among the top in Asean. Facebook revealed that Bangkok is Facebook's capital, with over 8.6 million accounts. Based on a survey by the Electronic Transactions Development Agency (ETDA), children and youth, aged from 5 to 28 years, are the group that has the highest internet penetration rate of 75% and spend 54.2 hours per week online, or close to 8 hours per day. What hurts Thai society is not only internet addiction, but also cyberbullying, in which children are both bullies and victims. The world realises the importance of children and youth, and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (Children’s Rights) states that every child has the right to be protected and developed. Living in today’s digital and internet world, children must be protected and cultivated with proper and constructive use of the internet in order to avoid harassment, threats, and cyberbullying, which have become a silent threat to the community that everyone cannot ignore. The www.nobullying.com website has conducted a survey and published a report on cyberbullying in Thailand. There have been concerns and cases of cyberbullying since 2002. Although cyberbullying in Thailand is currently not as serious as in other Asian countries, such as Singapore and Malaysia, it has rapidly increased. A recent study shows that 43% out of 2,500 Thai children aged from 12 to 24 years, have been threatened or bullied online, including sharing of personal information and photos as well as distributing improper video clips via email, website and social media. Digital Literacy for Digital Citizens In many countries that are facing a cyberbullying epidemic, various children’s rights organisations and agencies collaborate to resolve and protect against potential violence. All countries agree that digital literacy is essential in today’s digital world. In the UK, digital literacy is part of the elementary school curriculum, equivalent to science and mathematics. Digital literacy fosters knowledge, skills and behaviours in proper and creative use of the internet. The easier children have access to the internet, the more they need digital literacy education. As a vaccine for all digital citizens, digital literacy is important for everyone including parents and teachers. Tips to Stop Cyberbullying (Source: www.connectsafely.org) 1. Don’t respond. If someone bullies you, remember that your reaction is usually exactly what the bully wants. It gives him or her power over you. Who wants to empower a bully? 2. Don’t retaliate. Getting back at the bully turns you into one and reinforces the bully’s behaviour. Help avoid a whole cycle of aggression. 3. Save the evidence. The only good news about digital bullying is that the harassing messages can usually be captured, saved, and shown to someone who can help. You need to do this even if it’s minor stuff, in case things escalate. 4. Talk to a trusted adult. You deserve backup. It’s always good to involve a parent but — if you can’t — a school counsellor usually knows how to help. Sometimes both are needed. If you’re really nervous about saying something, see if there’s a way to report the incident anonymously at school. 5. Block the bully. If the harassment’s coming in the form of instant messages, texts, or profile comments, do yourself a favour: Use preferences or privacy tools to block the person. If it’s in chat, leave the “room.” 6. Be civil. Even if you don’t like someone, it’s a good idea to be decent and not sink to the other person’s level. Also, research shows that gossiping about and trash talking others increases your risk of being bullied. Treat people the way you want to be treated. 7. Don’t be a bully. How would you feel if someone harassed you? You know the old saying about walking a mile in someone’s shoes; even a few seconds of thinking about how another person might feel can put a big damper on aggression. 8. Be a friend, not a bystander. Watching or forwarding mean messages empowers bullies and hurts victims even more. If you can, tell bullies to stop or let them know harassment makes people look stupid and mean. It’s time to let bullies know their behaviour is unacceptable — cruel abuse of fellow human beings. If you can’t stop the bully, at least try to help the victim and report the behaviour. Lars Norling, Chief Executive Officer, Total Access Communication Plc or dtac has declared its commitment to support the Children’s Rights and Business Principles in collaboration with Unicef Thailand and to express its readiness as a publicly-traded company taking social responsibility seriously by promoting children’s rights from birth, digital literacy education, and the use of the internet in a safe and constructive way under the Safe Internet project.",OVAC

											Ending the scourge										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/793837/ending-the-scourge,"Violence against children and women is an issue of global concern and can occur in any society and all settings, even in the home, which should be the safest place. In East Asia and the Pacific, violence against children is prevalent among all population groups, and results in a heavy economic cost in addition to physical and psychological harm. Violence is a common experience in the lives of children throughout the region, said Stephen Blight, regional adviser for child protection with the United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef), citing the results of research by Unicef. The prevalence of violence including physical, sexual and emotional abuse as well as neglect is significant among all population groups regardless of income level, and it has lifelong impacts on the individual. ""The research establishes clear links between childhood experience of violence, and mental disorders later in life, adverse consequences on physical and sexual health, increased risk-taking behaviours among adolescents, and long-term impacts on adult aggression, violence and criminality,"" said Mr Blight, who is based in the East Asia Pacific regional office of Unicef in Bangkok. ""Violence against children has high economic costs for society. The annual economic loss due to the impacts of violence against children in East Asia and the Pacific has been estimated at US$209 billion, accounting for 2% of regional GDP. Preventing this violence is thus important for economic development among Asean member states."" Mr Blight made the comments at the launch of the Asean Regional Plan of Action on Elimination of Violence against Women and the Asean Regional Plan of Action on Elimination of Violence against Children in Bangkok earlier this month. The two action plans were endorsed by Asean leaders at their summit in Kuala Lumpur in late November. Both plans cover a period of 10 years from 2016 to 2025. ""Violence against children and women can happen in any society, ethnicity, religion and culture, and also in all settings such as a home, a workplace, community and educational institution,"" said Maitri Inthrusut, the permanent secretary of Thailand's Ministry of Social Development and Human Security, who presided over the launch. According to data from the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 35% of women around the world experience some form of physical or sexual violence in their lifetime. In most cases, violence against women happens at home and is perpetrated by their own spouses or partners. In Thailand, Public Health Ministry statistics indicated that almost 24,000 cases of violence against children and women were reported last year, or an average of 66 per day. Many more go unreported. ""The issue is addressed at the international, regional and national levels with relevant laws and obligations in place,"" said Mr Maitri. ""Domestically, the Thai cabinet announced an annual observance in November to raise awareness through campaigns on the elimination of violence against women and children."" The regional action plan on violence against children has eight components: prevention, protection, legal frameworks and prosecution, capacity building, research and data collaboration, monitoring and evaluation, as well as regional review and communication. In the area of prevention, awareness will be raised among all sectors of society of the harmful effects of all forms of violence against children through formal and informal education. An Asean guideline will be established on non-violent approaches to the nurture, care and development of children in all settings. The action plan also calls for regional guidelines for child protection systems in compliance with international standards, and strengthening national, bilateral and regional mechanisms to coordinate efforts among states and non-state entities. On the legal side, the plan calls for law reforms to prohibit all forms of violence against children, including the growing scourge of cyberbullying. ""Progressive efforts to enact national laws and implement related policies have shown a clear commitment from Asean to the prevention and elimination of violence against children,"" the action plan report said. ""Despite these initiatives, implementation and progress have been uneven. For instance, a comprehensive legal ban on all forms of violence against children, which is a key component of a comprehensive strategy to safeguard and protect the right of the child to freedom of violence, is not yet in place in all Asean member states."" A 2012 review of research on violence in the region commissioned by Unicef has shed light on this hidden phenomenon. Credible research estimates the prevalence of physical abuse among boys and girls to range from 10% to 30.3%; sexual abuse from 1.7% to 11.6%; emotional abuse from 31.3% to 68.5%; and child labour from 6.6% to 56%. Furthermore, three out of four children in the region experience violent discipline at the hands of teachers or parents, it added. The action plan on violence against women also has eight components including a comprehensive national framework that includes effective prevention and response policies and programmes. It also calls for accessible, effective and gender-sensitive complaint mechanisms with investigative and monitoring functions to deal with abuse and harassment in all workplaces. The legal framework would include gender-responsive national legislation to penalise all forms of violence against women. Training programmes for abusers and perpetrators based on the most effective models would promote good practices related to attitude changes and behaviour modification. ""Even 20 years after the adoption of Beijing Declaration, there has been little improvement in the elimination and rates of violence against women,"" the report said. ""It is urgent for Asean member states to give priority to the elimination of violence against women."" Violence against women encompasses but is not limited to physical, sexual, psychological and economic violence occurring in the family. Other forms include early and forced marriage as well as emerging forms such as cyberbullying. ""Diverse groups of women suffer from multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and inequalities, making them especially vulnerable to violence,"" the report added. ""They include women with disabilities, women living and affected by HIV and Aids, girls, older women, women living in disaster- or conflict-affected areas, stateless women and women trafficked for forced labour or sexual exploitation among others."" Unicef's Mr Blight said the regional plan should spur action by Asean nations to draft or update their own laws and policies in line with international standards and increase budgets for social welfare services for families with children. It should also serve as a platform for strengthened inter-country cooperation on child rights and protection. ""The priorities and planned results for the first five years of the plan are clear and substantial. Working together on these, we can make a real difference in protecting children from the scourge of violence in Asean,"" he said.",OVAC

Secret, a smartphone app that gained notoriety for allowing users to make anonymous comments to friends and nearby people, said Wednesday it was shutting down after just 16 months	 Co-founder David Byttow said in a blog post he made the decision in consultation with the board, and that the ""significant amount of invested capital"" would be returned to investors. Byttow did not offer a detailed explanation for the shutdown but noted that ""Secret does not represent the vision I had when starting the company, so I believe it's the right decision for myself, our investors and our team."" The company raised an estimated $35 million from investors. It was unclear how much of those funds remained. Secret was one of the popular smartphone apps which enabled people to express themselves anonymously, sometimes generating controversy for mean or hurtful comments. ""I'm extremely proud of our team, which has built a product that was used by over 15 million people and pushed the boundaries of traditional social media,"" Byttow said. ""I believe in honest, open communication and creative expression, and anonymity is a great device to achieve it. But it's also the ultimate double-edged sword, which must be wielded with great respect and care. I look forward to seeing what others in this space do over time."" Last year, when it announced a round of funding, Secret said it was aiming to expand as a social network connecting Facebook friends. At the time, the market value of Secret was estimated at $100 million. One feature allowed users to log in with Facebook and share with friends without revealing their identities. Anonymous apps have become popular, especially with students, but some critics say they may be used to spread false rumors or contribute to ""cyberbullying.""",OVAC

											Never too soon to talk about students’ net security										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/485358/never-too-soon-to-talk-about-students-net-security,"In November of last year, a Russian website that gave visitors access to hacked cameras from CCTV to webcams to baby monitors was shut down by authorities. As we move towards the internet of things, perhaps it is inevitable that our security and privacy will be threatened — one only has to look at the fallout from the Sony Pictures hack to see the massive international repercussions from such breaches of security. Nations and corporations obviously have a lot to lose through the compromise of cyber defences and the unintended release of protected data. At the same time, the cost of data breaches is arguably greater to those least able to defend themselves against cyber-attacks and other abuse of personal information: private citizens, and above all the most vulnerable citizens among us, namely children. The proliferation of low-cost mobile devices and pre-paid data plans has caused internet penetration among the young in Asia to explode, and such connectivity is only set to grow with the next generation of “digital natives”. Students and children certainly have much to gain from digital technology: mobile and cloud services have the power to transform education, and with that, lives and livelihoods. It is with this in mind that Microsoft works to get young Thai people connected, including the largest-ever education partnership with the Office of the Basic Education Commission which has brought eight million Thai students to the cloud. This is the generation that will be driving Thailand’s digital economy in the 21st century. At the same time, connectivity is not without its risks. Behaviourally targeted advertising and the sale of student information — “data mining” — are only some of the threats facing students online. Cyberbullying, exposure to inappropriate content, and identity theft are others. In Thailand the concern is being felt: according to a survey by international non-profit organisation SafeGov.org, 90% of Thai parents agree that school internet use will help their children learn creativity, problem solving, and critical thinking. At the same time, another 87% of parents are worried that their children’s online activities in school will be tracked for profit-making purposes by internet service providers who rely on advertising. These figures are broadly on par with the results of similar surveys conducted elsewhere in the world — clearly Thai parents are clear-eyed about the rewards and risks of cyberspace. All stakeholders have an obligation to respond. In the US, President Barack Obama has recently initiated the Student Digital Privacy Act, a new legislative proposal designed to provide teachers and parents the confidence they need to enhance teaching and learning with the best technology — by ensuring that data collected in the educational context is used for educational purposes only. Thailand is rapidly moving in the same direction, with millions of Thai children expected to come online over the same period. In order to maximise the benefits of connectivity and minimise the threats, we must all share the responsibility for keeping our children and their information safe online. The government needs to look into the recent cybersecurity draft bills, especially the data protection draft, where there is a concerning gap in the protection of students’ privacy online. To cultivate a safe environment where Thai students can flourish, the current data protection bill needs to incorporate provisions that limit the use of student data for authorised education purposes only.

											Parenting tech keeps tabs on children										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/tech/473348/parenting-tech-keeps-tabs-on-children,"SAN FRANCISCO - American parents may not have the resources of the National Security Agency, but it's not that hard for them to snoop on their smartphone-addicted kids. The LG GizmoPal wristband (R) synchs with a smartphone application to let parents keep tabs on their children's whereabouts	 A booming array of gadgets are being marketed to harried parents who want to keep tabs on their children, whether they are speeding in Mom's car or texting after hours when they should be asleep. There are fobs, watches and bracelets with location-sensing capabilities. Smart anklets track the ever-changing moods of babies. There is even a SleepIQ Kids Bed that can tip parents off when kids are up after hours. Many of these devices -- especially the ones designed to track older children -- are reliant on the smartphones that teens hold so dear, given their location-tracking features. ""Parents want to feel more safe and in control of the situation; its a sort of feel-good thing that parents can do,"" said Florida Atlantic University criminology professor Sameer Hinduja, co-director of the US Cyberbullying Research Center.   - Phones and trackers -   The six-year-old daughter of Frank Lee, a senior marketing manager at South Korean consumer electronics powerhouse LG, sports playfully colored GizmoPal wrist wear. The LG device designed for children lets them make mobile phone calls to pre-programmed numbers by pushing a button, and also taps into GPS capabilities to let parents easily check whether they arrived safely at their expected destination. GizmoPal can also receive calls, but only from select pre-designated numbers. ""At first she was a little excessive in calling us,"" Lee said.  ""I told her to let me know when she wants to stop wearing it, but she doesn't even like to take it off to let me charge it."" Applications that run in the background on teens' smartphones or tablets can access camera rolls, messages, web browsing activity and more, according to Hinduja. Software can even capture occasional screen shots of Web pages being viewed. In some cases, parents can set boundaries, or geo-fences, that will trigger text message or email alerts if children stray into areas that grown-ups have designated off-limits. ""We've heard of parents putting micro-chips in children,"" said Robert Lowery of the US National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. ""Of course, those things raise eyebrows. We don't advocate that."" Lowery, a former law enforcement officer, credited technology -- including social media sites like Facebook where well-targeted calls for help can spread quickly -- with ramping up the speed at which some missing children are located.   - Parenting trumps technology -   Hinduja however expressed concern that people might be sabotaging themselves with what they think are parenting short-cuts. ""In a perfect world, we want to have great relationships between parents and children so they will talk to parents about what is going on in their lives,"" Hinduja said. ""If parents are going behind kids' backs with this software, it basically kills any lines of communications that parents have probably worked years to develop."" He recommended that parents wait until older children prove they cannot be trusted before they resort to cyber-snooping technology. ""It feels like hacking life,"" Hinduja said. ""People shouldn't think there is software to make them a better parent, because there isn't."" Lee and Lowery agreed that good parenting trumps technology, which is best viewed as a helpful tool for keeping children safe and fostering communication in families. ""Technology can't replace the human connection,"" Lee said. ""It is about teaching responsibility regardless of the toy or tool."" Lowery advises parents to teach children common sense when it comes to safety practices. Kids should ""kick and scream if someone tries to grab them,"" Lowery said. ""An electronic device is not going to stop that -- it will just give us a good idea where they are going.""",OVAC

											Staying safe online										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/tech/416907/staying-safe-online,"So you think you’re safe behind your phone screen? Think again – neither you nor your precious child learning how to use Facebook can be assured of a completely trouble-free online life. “As parents, it is your responsibility to stay up-to-date with the latest online trends so that you are equipped to have a meaningful and sincere conversation with your children about appropriate internet behaviour and best practices.” PHILIP ROUTLEY Norton Internet Security The modern technologies that have made communication so easy have also given rise to some disturbing trends, or perhaps they have simply enabled the twisted behaviour that has always existed in a minority of people. The internet has created a pathway that has allowed bullying to advance from the schoolyard and into people’s homes and even bedrooms. Makoto, a Japanese victim of cyberbullying who attempted suicide twice, said that his classmates posted his pictures on websites along with insults and e-mailed him at every hour telling him to die. “Even when I stopped going to school and stayed home, my mobile phone kept ringing with harassing e-mails,” Makoto told Reuters reporters. The online bullying led him to shut himself off from the real world. He rarely left his room for nearly six months. “Cyberbullying is a trigger that sends such persons into stages of anxiety and depression,” said psychologist Pisinee Dangwung, who specialises in counselling teenagers. “Lonely individuals with low self-esteem or high insecurity may unfortunately decide to take their own lives.” She said that 60-70% of the teenagers who come to seek therapy at the Teen Center of Samitivej Srinakarin Hospital in Bangkok have experienced some forms of cyberbullying. “Their reactions toward the incidents varied from sad, angry, humiliated, mildly anxious or, in the more severe cases, depressed.” Inconsiderate acts such as posting false statements on a Facebook wall or sending anonymous messages through social media applications, telling someone that the world would be a better place without them, are common examples of the bullying that takes place in today’s online world. The legal system cannot do much about children and teens who bully their peers online. But when adults are involved as either victims or the originators of the hostile messages, such harassment or stalking becomes a crime, plain and simple. For those who have been harassed online, the frustration of not knowing how to deal with it can make the problem worse, especially if the perpetrators have managed to remain anonymous, which is not hard on the internet. Ms Pisinee counsels victims not to “seek revenge and give the bullies the satisfaction that they have hurt you or messed with your feelings. Most of them are unhappy people who just want to bring others down”. “With the increasing number of children on social networks (a global average of 7 hours and 15 minutes a week), this also means that bullying can be more invasive than ever before. Nine in 10 children who were cyberbullied are social network users,” said Philip Routley, product marketing manager for Symantec, the maker of Norton internet security products. To measure the extent of cyberbullying around the world, the Microsoft Computing Safety Index (MCSI) surveyed more than 7,500 children aged between 8 and 17 years in 25 countries. China was ranked as the world’s top country with 70% of respondents reporting harassment, followed by Singapore at 58% and India at 53%, against a global average of 37%. Microsoft’s Global Youth Online Behaviour Survey in 2012 reported that one in three young people in Malaysia had been affected by cyberbullying. The Star Online reported that cyberbullying cases in the country rose 55.6% from 2012 to 2013. “In general, online bullying appears to flourish in countries where GDP growth is high, internet growth has been rapid and online social norms are still forming,” the Microsoft survey stated. With 75% of the population online and with the fourth highest smartphone penetration in the world, Singapore is an obvious target for cyberbullying, according to a report by the consultancy McKinsey & Co. However, the Singaporean government has been taking crucial steps to prevent further discrimination. Among them was the recent passage of the Protection from Harassment Act 2014. “Harassment can take place in the physical space and in the online space. Cyberspace makes harassment easier, and in some ways, more egregious, because it is anonymous, borderless, viral and permanent,” Singaporean Minister of Law K Shanmugam said during the second reading of the act. “Educational institutions and schools also need to do more to enforce appropriate usage policies with the technologies that are made available to them, so that young children in particular are only given access to the internet with adult supervision,” suggested Mr Routley of Symantec. Few other Asian countries have done much to raise awareness and declare cyberbullying a serious social threat despite evidence of suicides or attempts by young victims.In India, for example, the IT Act of 2000 and the Juvenile Justice Act lack rules and regulations for internet usage and information regarding cyberbullying, according to research by lecturer K Jaishankar and research assistant Debarati Halder. Because schools often play a greater role than parents in shaping child behaviour in India, greater enforcement of internet rules in educational environment, along with legislation, is sorely needed, Mr Jaishankar added. In China, a 2013 paper written by academics at Central China Normal University said that cyberbullying “has yet to receive adequate scholarly attention in China, especially on the mainland”. “Interestingly, despite a relatively high percentage of children having negative online experiences in Asia Pacific and Japan, three quarters of children choose to hide their online activities from adults, which is why 92% of parents don’t know that their child has been cyberbullied,” said Mr Routley, quoting statistics from the latest Norton Online Family Report. Marian Merritt, a board member of the Family Online Safety Institute, stated in an article that because cyberbullying can bring shame to schools and families in Japan, young people have moved their online activities to more discreet websites that request login information with passwords. This makes it much more difficult for parents to track their children’s online activities. “As parents, it is your responsibility to stay up-to-date with the latest online trends so that you are equipped to have a meaningful and sincere conversation with your children about appropriate internet behaviour and best practices,” Mr Routley suggested. Apart for adults being involved in teens’ technological activities, Ms Pisinee of Samitivej advises: “Strong relationships between teens and their parents play a crucial role in helping reduce the number of cyberbullying-related suicides.” But healing the wounds caused by cyberbullying will never be easy. “When people tell you your life is not worth living, you start to think that way,” said Makoto, the young Japanese victim. “I couldn’t believe in human beings anymore.”",OVAC
29,29,2014-06-16 00:43:00,Tangled web,https://www.bangkokpost.com/life/social-and-lifestyle/415502/tangled-web,"To adults discussing online privacy, cyberbullying might not be seen as problematic. In today’s virtual world where people post, share, comment and criticise, at times harshly, the social friction among young people risks slipping under the radar. Some youngsters tease or joke online without realising that their actions constitute bullying. In some countries, there have been resulting cases of trauma and even suicide. “Someone spread online that my friend was involved with drugs,” recent high school graduate Penkawin Vatanajang recalled. “But she really was not. My friend didn’t know what to do. I was trying to console her, telling her to calm down, that nobody was going to believe such a lie.” Penkawin explained that what started the whole scenario was a tangled relationship problem. The groundless accusation may seem like a small issue, but it succeeded in tarnishing her friend’s reputation when the claim spread. Things are not looking better for slightly older teenagers either. Kanda*, a university student in Bangkok, described a scenario she witnessed on an online community. “A senior at my university posted on the faculty’s Facebook page calling one junior who stole her man a slut,” said Kanda. “The post also revealed the junior’s name and contact details. It was pretty scary. “Word spread and they were both called in to meet the chancellor. I think they were suspended. But the thing was, they already had a 'slapfest' [physical altercation] before everything went online.” Cyberbullying, as the name suggests, is a type of bullying being done online, in many cases between children, with the intention to hurt or humiliate others. The problem, though somewhat unknown to and not experienced by older generations, is very widespread in the world of youths. Assist Prof Wimontip Musikaphan from the National Institute for Child and Family Development, Mahidol University. Though they sometimes happen concurrently — or one happens to be a cause or effect of the other — cyberbullying is different from traditional or physical bullying. Cyberbullying mainly involves psychological attacks on the person. Aside from spreading claims or publicising private information, the attacks may include, but are not limited to, sending threatening messages and hate speech, ganging up on a person, touching up someone’s pictures in a degrading way, or by continuing to text someone repeatedly even though the person has asked the sender not to. The “sharing” nature of the internet and social media makes cyberbullying very effective at hurting someone as everything can be spread and shared with a single click. The attack can be anonymous, and it is also away from adult eyes, which make punishment and accountability difficult. In some cases, it is almost too easy for some children to be cruel to each other because they know they can get away with it. “Children do understand that it’s not OK,” said Assist Prof Wimontip Musikaphan from the National Institute for Child and Family Development, Mahidol University, during a recent seminar on children’s online privacy. “However, some do believe that people can do what they want — that they have a right to do it. Some view that cyberbullying is just a joke among children. But what is scary is that some actually think it’s a normal behaviour. Some say that it’s very common and that everyone does it anyway.” As of now, there is no real indicator to determine if cyberbullying has contributed to deaths in Thailand, but this is not to say we should take the issue for granted. For adults who pass this issue off as normal child’s play that they should not interfere with, Dr Wimontip suggested they reconsider. “This tells us that we’re instilling violence and viewing it as a common thing,” said Dr Wimontip. “When we accept that violent behaviour is normal, it’s like we are creating a kind of society for our children to grow up with violence to a point where they actually get used to it. It shouldn’t be like that.” It is advised that families should start taking action when it comes to their children’s online behaviour. There is detection software available that can be used to monitor children’s use of words on the internet. However, Dr Wimontip explained that children can always come up with new slang that the software is not able to detect, rendering the programs useless. Even taking away mobile phones or banning the internet would not work. “They will and can always find a way around it,” said Dr Wimontip. It seems cyberbullying is not an activity that can be easily stopped. In the US and Japan, there have been high-profile cases of suicide after young victims received repeated online attacks from peers and strangers alike. Thai children, Dr Wimontip speculated, are considerably milder in their attacks, and most of the children’s families step in before cases escalate into something serious. So to prevent cyberbullying from transgressing into life-threatening issues, Dr Wimontip suggested that building tolerance in children could be a solution. This includes strengthening their emotional capacity and educating them in proper use of the internet and social media. “We can keep them in the house because danger is outside, but we can’t lock their lives inside forever. They have to be prepared for what’s out there,” said Dr Wimontip. Since they are well aware of the issue, the younger generations have some insights to offer. As someone who has seen cyberbullying in action, Kanda believed this is not one person’s problem to conquer. It takes both adults and children to fight this battle together. “Adults are handling this with their own standards and mindset. Whether this is due to their want to protect the children or whatever, they are forgetting that children are a part of this society and that they are involved in this problem, both directly and indirectly. Children should learn the consequences of their words and actions in the online world,” said the undergraduate. It is unfortunate that we hear so little from children even though cyberbullying is a child-centred problem. Feeling as though they are excluded from fixing their own problem, some of the children and teenagers alike are expressing their eagerness to get involved in taking a stand against the issues surrounding them. Believing this problem should be solved right at the source, Prim*, a student from Rayong province, has a solution to offer her fellow peers. “If there’s a problem, we should just talk it out. We don’t have to put it online and let the whole world know. It’s not something we have to tease, humiliate or defame each other with on social media,” said the high-schooler, who also added that adults, as spectators, just don’t know what really goes on in the teenage world. * Names have been changed.",OVAC

											Let’s teach our children to become good digital citizens										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/411278/let-s-teach-our-children-to-become-good-digital-citizens,"As we make progress in computing technology and build more complex tools, getting connected to the internet has become easier. Many mobile devices are now equipped with features allowing us to browse the net. In cities, there are free Wi-Fi hot spots and internet cafes around nearly every corner. Communication towers and antennas are sprouting like weeds, expanding internet access to more and more rural areas. Ease of internet access has spawned social media and countless applications, games and tools that have now become daily life staples. For runners, there are mobile apps that allow them to track their distances via GPS or a connected pedometer. Kilometres and workouts can be logged and shared with friends on the web. There are apps that provide a virtual tour of the Louvre. Others are used to track diet and calorie intake, provide daily exercise tips, give driving directions, and store and share recipes. There are all sorts of games and puzzle apps, music apps, pictures and video apps. There’s practically an app for everything. And if one doesn’t exist yet, there’s probably a beta version in the works. It seems like our lifestyles and needs have motivated the development of these tools and apps. But in turn, do these tools and apps also shape our lives? Speaking from personal experience, I say “yes”. Before the internet, the extent of a newspaper’s reach was limited to the size of its circulation. With the growth of the World Wide Web, bangkokpost.com can reach people outside of the physical circulation. Software layout tools allow Bangkok Post to create different ways to present news, editorials and reports. As an editor, introduction of the web changed the way I work. The publication process, datelines, work timeline and the editing process are now different than it was then. Capturing Bangkok life for the paper used to be a desk job. Now, it is 24/7 with my notepads and pens augmented by a laptop and a smartphone. Social media platforms such as Facebook have allowed me to be more involved with my extended family. My niece’s daughter, Jamie, grew up in the US and has never visited Thailand. For years, I was content with seeing pictures and hearing news from family members that she is happy and healthy. However, since Jamie signed up for a Facebook account, I’ve been reading her posts and enjoying seeing pictures that she takes. Facebook allows me to share her interests, get a taste of her personality and understand her point of view. For her, I think that she appreciates the control that she has over what she wants to share and what she wants to keep private. The same goes for other family members and friends. Though I still prefer the old-fashioned way of getting to know someone (through face-to-face conversations and meetings), when great distances, time zones and other life priorities get in the way, I don’t mind settling for passively reading status updates and posts. To me, the growth of internet access and social applications has a positive impact on my life. In respect to work, it allows me to engage with a larger audience. In respect to family and friends, it allows me the convenience to stay in touch and in the loop. However, all tools and apps have the potential to negatively shape our lives. In recent years, there have been increasing reports of people getting fired from their jobs because of comments they posted in blogs or on Facebook. Cyberbullying has grabbed national attention in the US following reports of teens committing suicide due to taunting harassment and threats using text messages, emails, blogs and Facebook posts. Criminals have also migrated their operations to the web. Identity theft, bank account theft and internet scams have also increased. So if internet trappings and apps can both positively and negatively shape people’s lives, then how can anyone avoid the adverse effects? I think that there is no one right answer. Even the most cautious web surfer can on occasion inadvertently catch a computer virus or a worm. However, I think that part of the answer lies in education; notably, the younger generation who will grow up in this internet age. Kids today are very competent in using the internet. However, it can’t be assumed that they are also competent in spotting cons, or if they are aware that opinions expressed in cyberspace have real-world repercussions. It’s very important that we, not just the immediate parents, but relatives, mentors and teachers set a good example. Rather than taking office dramas to Facebook, resolve the conflict professionally, face-to-face, in the real world. Just as kids are taught to look both ways before crossing the street, they can also be taught to recognise internet scams. Children are taught not to use foul language and profanities in the playground. They can also be taught not to use the same language online. Children have supervised play until they are grown enough to understand rough play and safe play. So they should also be supervised until they have grown to understand the dos and don’ts of social media. I don’t have the luxury of being a hands-on family member for Jamie. But I intend on following her on Facebook. I will Like her accomplishments and celebrate her individuality. And if she does something inappropriate, I will let her know (perhaps a phone call to her mum if the situation warrants it). Technology is a wonderful tool. So let’s remain engaged and teach the children properly. If we can get this far with the internet, imagine what they can do with it in the years to come.

											In new social networks, anonymity is all the rage										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/402517/in-new-social-networks-anonymity-is-all-the-rage,"When mobile social app Yik Yak swept into Auburn University, some of the coolest kids were quick to start posting on it. Websites for several anonymous social networking apps in Washington, DC	 But no one knows who is saying what because the comments are anonymous. ""It spread pretty fast,"" says Nickolaus Hines, a junior at the school in the US state of Alabama. ""The majority of things are jokes or things which are obviously funny,"" said the 21-year-old. But ""some ... are pretty mean."" Yik Yak, which allows smartphone users to see posts in a radius up to five miles (eight kilometers), is part of a flurry of new apps that offer novel ways to interact on social networks without revealing one's identity. But while some laud these new platforms, others blame them for false rumors, stress and even suicide. ""Anonymity is a beautiful thing,"" Yik Yak claims. ""It gives people a blank slate to work from, effectively removing all preconceptions about them."" Apps of this kind are certainly raising eyebrows in Silicon Valley and beyond. Secret, launched last year, recently raised $8.6 million in venture capital. Whisper, which has been around for almost two years, claims 2.5 billion page views for its service. It has raised a reported $21 million. It said the app springs from ""a deep belief that the way people share and interact with each other is changing."" Other anonymity apps include PostSecret and the brand new Rumr. A real-time chat service, Rumr says ""it's like having a conversation with the lights off."" Ask.fm, a Latvian-based group, says 35 million people have downloaded its anonymous sharing app since June 2013 in more than a dozen countries. ""Ask.fm gives people a chance to communicate and not to be afraid that their views and beliefs can be judged,"" said spokeswoman Liva Biseniece. Some say the move to anonymity is a response to a growing ability to track people's activities and social network posts -- in some cases leading to lasting reputation damage. ""I think these apps are creating a safe place for people to share their thoughts and opinions,"" says Daniel Odio, a senior vice president at the social media plug-in Share who follows social networking trends. ""Once you say something, it can't be unsaid. We've seen stories of people who can't get jobs because of what they said on Facebook when they were in college.""   - Dark side of anonymity -   While many college students are attracted to such apps, experts worry about their dark side. Several high and middle schools have sought to block them because of pranks, rumor-mongering and even bomb threats. And anonymity can also provide a cloak for cyber bullies. Justin Patchin at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire who co-directs the Cyberbullying Research Center says the apps give tyrants new tools. ""We see veiled threats or open threats,"" he told AFP. ""In these anonymous environments, it's very distressing to students who don't know who to be afraid of."" Prominent venture capitalist Marc Andreessen spoke out on the subject in a series of Twitter posts.  Without naming specific apps, he warned against new services ""designed to encourage negative behavior."" ""Such experiments start out as naughty fun, end with broken hearts and ruined lives. In the end everyone regrets participating in them,"" he wrote.   - Online 'savagery' -   Natasha Burgert, a pediatrician who blogs on children's issues, finds such apps disturbing. ""We have seen time and time again the savagery that can emerge from online anonymity,"" she wrote. ""In the developing teenager's mind, the long-term consequences and repercussions of these anonymous postings are not physically capable of being understood. And in the most tragic cases, lives are lost by a string of keystrokes."" The apps do allow users to report offensive or inappropriate comments and most are intended for persons 18 and older.  Ask.fm's Biseniece said the firm has ""internal safety protocols to detect and remove upsetting content."" Danah Boyd, a Microsoft researcher and author of a book on teens and social networks, said the apps feed basic curiosity.  ""What you end up seeing is the full range of human attitudes towards others -- good, bad, and mega ugly,"" Boyd said.   At Auburn University, Hines said he thinks the fad will pass. ""I don't see it getting popular because anonymous things don't have as much,"" he told AFP.   ",OVAC

It stressed that it encourages users and their parents to report any bullying. The website, which is popular amongst teenagers, has a question-and-answer format and allows users to post messages without their identity being disclosed. Hannah's father has called for the website to face murder or manslaughter charges. Cameron urged website operators to do more to stop them from being used as forums for bullying. ""The people that operate these websites have got to step up to the plate and show some responsibility in the way that they run these websites,"" he said. ""I'm very keen we look at all the action we can take to try and stop future tragedies like this."" Created in 2010 and based in Latvia, ask.fm has some 13.2 million daily users.

											Parents faced with knowledge gap when teaching web safety: survey										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/359395/parents-faced-with-knowledge-gap-when-teaching-web-safety-survey,"The majority of parents would welcome an online safety assessment as a way of ensuring they're equipped to keep their children protected when surfing the web. Parents need help in understanding the online risks that their children may face, according to researchers. A survey of 2,000 UK parents highlights growing concerns about children's online safety, with 95 percent of respondents agreeing that ‘e-safety' should be a compulsory element of school education -- 52 percent of all parents said that they had made school selection decisions based in part on a school's ability to teach online safety. However, almost two thirds (66%) of parents accept that ultimately the responsibility of educating their children and keeping them safe when surfing the web rests with them. And therein lies a problem. Although 92 percent of parents claim they're confident in their ability to teach online safety, the study, commissioned by AVG Technologies as part of the research report ""Parents, Schools and the Digital Divide"" in partnership with Plymouth University in the UK, found that there is a widening gap between parents' perceived and actual knowledge when it comes to the web. As Tony Anscombe, AVG's senior security evangelist, comments: ""Despite their confidence, our research shows that parents clearly need help to stay ahead of how children are using the Internet."" As part of its report, the company has drawn up a list of recommendations, to be presented on July 11 at the Child Internet Safety Summit, for an easy-to-use assessment for parents so that they too can understand the issues around online safety and the types of threats their children may face when logging on. The study shows that this knowledge gap is having an impact on parents' decision-making processes when considering whether or not to discuss certain subjects with their children in relation to the internet. For example, 56 percent of parents with children in primary or secondary school (i.e., aged between seven and 16 years old) and 42 percent of parents with teenaged children have not broached the subject of sexual online adult content. In terms of other risks or threats, 89 percent of parents with children in primary or secondary school said they believe their child has not been involved in either cyberbullying or sexting. Considering these responses, it comes as little surprise that 86 percent of parents said that they would welcome an online safety assessment to help them close this knowledge gap. AVG and the University of Plymouth will be detailing the full extent of their findings at the Child Internet Safety Summit on July 11 and will also be detailing recommendations for government-supported internet safety schemes. In the meantime, for parents concerned that their internet understanding needs a refresher course or that their children may be at risk, the US government has published a helpful guide to internet safety which is hosted on the FBI's website at http://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/parent-guide.",OVAC

File photo shows a student using a computer. Facebook's big stock offering on Wall Street must be followed by an intensive debate on Main Street about social media's powerful impact on children, an expert on the topic says.	 Jim Steyer, founder of Common Sense Media, a San Francisco think tank focusing on media and families, said the technology that Facebook represents is having ""an enormous impact"" on youngsters, families and schools worldwide. ""We need to have a big national, if not global conversation about the pros and cons of that,"" Steyer, a father of four who is also a civil rights lawyer and Stanford University professor, told AFP in an interview. While social media such as Facebook, Google Plus and Twitter offer ""extraordinary possibilities"" in such areas as education, he said, ""there are also real downsides in a social, emotional and cogitative development way."" ""Hopefully, after the flurry of the IPO and after the valuation of Facebook is done, then we can have a very serious ongoing discussion of what this means,"" he said. Steyer was in Washington to promote his just-published book ""Talking Back to Facebook: The Common Sense Guide to Raising Kids in the Digital Age,"" which argues for greater parental involvement in their children's online lives. ""Whether we like it or not, kids are now spending far more time with media and technology than they are with their families or in school,"" -- as much as eight hours a day on average in the United States alone, he wrote. Children face the triple peril of what Steyer calls RAP -- relationship issues, attention and addiction problems, and privacy issues -- as well as cyberbullying, online pornography and, for girls, body image fears. Steyer is particularly critical of Silicon Valley tycoons -- he knows many on a first-name basis -- who, unbridled by government regulation, insist that privacy no longer matters in an increasingly interconnected world. ""This extraordinary revolution in digital media has been driven by young (software) engineers, many of whom are not parents, many of whom are somewhat socially awkward and many of whom have not really thought through the social and emotional consequences"" of their products, he said. ""There is an arms race for data, and to build things as fast as possible ... but that's not a great strategy when you're talking about kids,"" he said, accusing tech outfits for ""not respecting the concept of privacy."" Earlier this week, a Consumer Reports survey found nearly 13 million US Facebook users -- out of 157 million, and 900 million worldwide -- do not use, or are not aware of, the site's privacy controls. Girls are especially vulnerable, Steyer said, with studies indicating that many body-conscious teens are photoshopping images of themselves so as to look thinner and score more ""likes"" among their friends. By way of advice to parents, he recommended ""personal technology time-outs"" and banning smartphones at the dinner table. ""Meal time should not be tech time,"" he said. Children must also be taught to reflect before hitting the ""send"" button on something they might later regret, refrain from anonymous comments, and not to believe everything they read or see online. On a governmental level, Steyer suggested the United States follow Europe's lead in privacy regulation and introduce an ""eraser button"" enabling users to wipe off anything they might have posted in the past. ""We need clear and simple rules (around privacy) for the tech companies, too, because right now they've dominated the debate and they've set the rules themselves,"" he said. But the immediate responsibility, he said, falls on moms and dads. ""It's part of parenting 2.0 today, so you have to do your homework,"" he said. ""You have to actually learn the rules of the road... and then you have to set clear and simple limits for kids, set clear rules of behavior -- and you have to be a role model.

											Online child sex abuse nears record high with coronavirus										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/1937644/online-child-sex-abuse-nears-record-high-with-coronavirus,"Online child sex abuse cases in Thailand are set to hit a record high this year, police said on Thursday, with cybersex predators exploiting the new coronavirus crisis to target more children. The police-led Internet Crimes Against Children (TICAC) taskforce has rescued more than 100 children in the last two months - almost double the 53 victims helped in 2018, which was the highest annual figure since its foundation in 2016. ""Children aren't going to school and criminals are taking advantage of this to look for income during unemployment,"" Thakoon Nimsomboon, head of TICAC, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. The global spread of cheap, high-speed internet and the rise in mobile phone ownership has fuelled cybersex crimes in recent years, with children from Thailand to the Philippines being exploited over livestreams for paying clients worldwide. Officials and activists have seen child cybersex abuse worsen under the coronavirus pandemic as families have struggled to earn a living while children have been at home and online, fuelling calls for better child education on internet safety. Since mid-April, the police taskforce has recovered more than 150,000 files of child sexual abuse material and opened 53 cases. In 2019, they had 72 cases involving 46 victims. ""There is a high possibility that figures this year will reach a record high, especially since officers have time to investigate due to less crime on the streets,"" said Pol Col Thakoon, who is also deputy commander of the anti-trafficking unit. Thailand has ramped up efforts to tackle child sex abuse in recent years, with the 2016 launch of TICAC by the Royal Thai Police, which works hand-in-hand with local non-governmental organisations to track down offenders and their victims. It has 180 officers who hold full-time positions in other police agencies. TICAC has investigated more than 280 cases of internet-facilitated child sexual exploitation since 2016, of which 81 are related to human trafficking. The rest are related to sexual abuse and pornography. Wirawan Mosby, director of the HUG Project, a charity that helps trafficked children, said the government should improve school internet safety policies, especially when children are learning from home. ""Having such high figures is not something to be proud of, and law enforcement is not solving the problem at the root cause,"" she said. Child rights experts are urging Thailand to enact a law that will criminalise grooming of children for sexual abuse, which will help protect them from being sex trafficked. ""Since we don't have this law yet, children need to become victims first in order to press charges (towards the offender),"" said Ms Wirawan. ""This is why we need to focus on prevention and educating children.""",OVAC

Ambassador Adisak Panupong, Special Advisor, Thailand Institute of Justice (TIJ), noted that: “TIJ places the importance of child rights and child sensitivity on every dimension of the criminal justice system. We are aware that child abuse is a crucial problem on a global scale. Also, law enforcement professionals coming into contact with child victims and witnesses play a crucial role in responding to crimes against children and protecting child victims and witnesses, while restoring human rights and dignity of child victims and witnesses. This is the reason that TIJ has invited law enforcement agencies and multidisciplinary teams from various countries to come to discuss and share good practices on the issue.” “I strongly believe that representatives from various agencies attending the workshop will benefit enormously from the knowledge of expert speakers from such agencies as the NCA from UK, FBI and HSI from USA, and develop a clear understanding of child rights, ethical standards and psychological analysis of child victims and witnesses, as well as self-care for professionals working with children which will guarantee effective protection of children, access to justice, and delivery of justice.”  Pol. Capt. Khemachart Prakaihongmanee, Deputy Director of Bureau of Foreign Affairs and Transnational Crime at the Department of Special Investigation (DSI) added: “Over the past year we have worked with Interpol’s ICSE database to catch offenders in over 50 cases and intercepted over 60,000 indecent images.”   “However, catching the bad guy is not the end of the story; the problem is that children are likely to be abused repeatedly when returning to the same abusive environment. To resolve this, we need our officers to possess an understanding the knowledge of the psychology of child rights protection which involves three parties: victims, TIJ joins forces with five organizations to promote ethics and psychology for protection of children’s rights offenders and law enforcers. This will contribute to building the capacity of the forensic interview by the officers of child victims, the creation of a manual of ethical standards for the offenders, and a study of the psychological aspects of both victims and offenders.”  Continuing on the point was Mr. Robbert van den Berg, Executive Director, ECPAT, who explained that: “Sex offenders travel. They use the internet and no country is immune. An enormously worrying trend that we have seen over past years is live streaming in the Philippines, as well as online grooming; “sexting” and “sextortion” within the ASEAN region. We see an increasing collaboration between law enforcement agencies within the region and foreign law enforcement agencies. I would like to offer some small suggestions for Thailand to help combat this issue. These are: the need for more research; improvement of Thailand’s national database — a vital tool for finding and identifying both victims and prosecutors; the continuation of investment in the capacity of law enforcement and individual police officers in Thailand and recruiting more female police investigators.”  Mrs. Malina Enlund, Thailand Country Manager, A21, added that: “We have very high respect for the people working on the front lines — both DSI and Thailand Internet Crimes Against Children (TICAC) — for a long time who we have worked with. The approach that we are taking is to support the police and concerned government agencies and fill in the gaps. It is essential for NGOs to work with the Thai Government and support the police, and ensure that they are not dealing on their own with a problem that is not created by Thailand alone. We realize that we need to put more effort into not only working with law enforcement and government but also empowering them to do their job and supporting them through their journey dealing with difficult social issues in Thailand.  Dr. Lasse Schuldt, DAAD Lecturer, CPG, also commented that: “Our role in this project is to give the workshop an academic framing, draft a report on the findings, and submit our recommendations. We are boosting our efforts to introduce international standards to Thai law enforcement authorities. From a legal standpoint, we work mostly on issues of criminal procedure and victims’ rights in criminal procedures. This can relate to the interrogation of victims and to the prevention of repeated interrogations, as well as the question to what extent the rights of victims needs to be balanced against the rights of defendants. Human rights play an important role here on the side of both victims and defendants.”  Every child has rights, while the promotion and protection of these rights is an urgent global issue. Therefore, it is hoped that this workshop will lead to the creation of an actual curriculum with which Thai authorities may enhance their expertise as well as a network to establish a code of conduct and develop ethical standards with the aim of forging international cooperation in combatting exploitation of children.  TIJ aims to continue to promote children’s rights and encourage a child-sensitive criminal justice system in accordance with international standards, especially the United Nations Model Strategies on the Elimination of Violence against Children in the Field on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, as a collaborative platform for policy advocacy, research, and capacity building in Thailand, Southeast Asia, and beyond. ",OVAC

Prime Minister Theresa May warned tech companies they had ""not done enough"" to protect users and that her government intended to put ""a legal duty of care"" on the firms ""to keep people safe""	 The plans unveiled in a policy paper, which also include creating an independent regulator, aim to tackle all kinds of harmful content from encouraging violence and suicide to spreading disinformation and cyber bullying. The issue has gained added urgency with Facebook's failure to immediately halt livestreams of a March 15 attack by a self-avowed white supremacist on two mosques in New Zealand that killed 50 people. Prime Minister Theresa May warned tech companies they had ""not done enough"" to protect users and that her government intended to put ""a legal duty of care"" on the firms ""to keep people safe"". ""For too long these companies have not done enough to protect users, especially children and young people, from harmful content,"" she said in a statement. ""That is not good enough, and it is time to do things differently. ""Online companies must start taking responsibility for their platforms, and help restore public trust in this technology."" The new laws envisaged will apply to any company that allows users to share or discover user generated content or interact with each other online. That will include file hosting sites and chat forums as well as the better known social media platforms, messaging services and search engines. Firms could face tough penalties for failing to meet the standards. ""We are consulting on powers to issue substantial fines, block access to sites and potentially to impose liability on individual members of senior management,"" the government said. Under the proposals, a new regulator would have the power to force platforms and others to publish annual transparency reports. They would include the levels of harmful content disseminated on their sites and how they addressed the problem. The regulator will also be able to issue codes of practice, which could compel companies to meet certain requirements, such as hiring fact-checkers, particularly during election periods.

											Disturbing new trends emerge in sexual abuse of children										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/437300/disturbing-new-trends-emerge-in-sexual-abuse-of-children,"A recent United Nations report draws attention to alarming trends in sex offences against children in Southeast Asia. Contributing factors range from economic disparity, urbanisation and cheaper air travel to faster internet connections that have fostered a huge child pornography industry, with many types of offenders. A researcher from the children's rights group Terre des Hommes starts a session in a public chat room where users solicit a fake 10-year-old named ""Sweetie from the Philippines"", in a computer-generated image. The group says that in recent years more child prostitutes in Southeast Asia have been leaving the streets but the abusive sex trade has simply moved online. Sex offenders who prey on children have adjusted as technology and demographic changes in the region make it even easier to engage in illicit activities, says the 49-page report titled ""Protecting the Future: Improving the Response to Child Sex Offending in Southeast Asia"", released by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). Debunking the stereotype that those engaged in child sexual exploitation are westerners, the report also shows that Asian tourists and expats are increasingly involved. ""Tackling child sex exploitation is no simple task. Finding solutions to this appalling crime will require a concerted effort from a multitude of actors across the region,"" said Jeremy Douglas, the UNODC Regional Representative. ""The dividends from a well-coordinated response include efficiency and respect for the rule of law. But more importantly, it will create a safer environment for children and ensure offenders are stopped in their tracks."" Action in one country is longer sufficient as offenders can easily migrate to jurisdictions with less resistance, said Mr Douglas. ""For too long, a piecemeal approach has been the norm, and while national governments and the international community can count some major successes in the past few years, without a comprehensive response to the problem, exploitation will continue to lurk just below the surface,"" he warned. According to the International Labour Organisation, there are approximately 4.5 million victims of sexual exploitation around the world, around 20% of them children. These child victims exist in every country in Asia and are caught in a range of different circumstances that make them vulnerable to exploitation. The UNODC report explained the intertwined nature of sexual exploitation of children — which encompasses the overlapping issues of the prostitution, the depiction of children in sexual abuse material (child pornography), trafficking of children for sexual purposes, and the sexual abuse of children (including but not limited to child sex tourism). The report said socio-economic disparities increase vulnerability to victimisation, as GDP per capita in the region ranges from $944 in Cambodia, with similarly low levels in Myanmar and Laos, Vietnam ($1,716), Indonesia ($3,557), to Thailand and China (around $6,000). In Thailand, tourism constitutes 6.5% of the country's gross domestic product. The country is also a top destination for sex tourism for foreigners around the world. The combination of the region's youthful population and widespread poverty also increases vulnerability to child sex exploitation, the report said. The economic growth arising from tourism has not always translated into better opportunities for children who live in tourist areas, it said. Children found in these areas, such as those employed in entertainment establishments or living or working on the street, are at greater risk of being exploited. Unfortunately, historical, economic and social issues in the region have created in some cases an environment ripe for sex tourism and with this, avenues for the sexual exploitation of children in tourism and travel, the report emphasised. ""The scale of the challenge is immense. Cheaper air travel, globalisation and new telecommunications technologies all interact to exacerbate an already complex and difficult problem,"" the report concluded. As governments in the region struggle to take control of the situation, travellers who prey on the young adapt and move to areas with more lax regulation and enforcement. In short, a crackdown in one country can lead to an influx in another. For example, Cambodia, Vietnam and, more recently, Mongolia have suffered an influx of tourists whose main goal is to have sex with a child, possibly as a result of the Thai government's efforts to combat child sex exploitation within its borders. The information was provided by Ecpat, a non-government organisation to ""End Child Prostitution, Child Pornography and Trafficking of Children for Sexual Purposes."" Offenders have developed and shared a number of methods to disguise their criminal activities. For example, the use of multiple passports and absconding bail in order to travel between countries in the region, particularly to those that have a lower capacity for detecting these crimes, and concealing identities when engaged on online child sex chat forums, the report said. Well-established patterns of child sex exploitation integrated into tourism flows suggest future growth projections will threaten many more children in Myanmar and Cambodia as the number of arrivals is expected to triple and double, respectively. The process of urbanisation could also dislocate families from traditional and stable sources of income in their home countries, or regions. ""This economic precariousness can push some people into the sex industry, especially young people who are also disconnected from their families and susceptible to outside influence,"" the report added. Responses to this trend should not attempt to limit the flow of people into cities, but rather prepare them for the risks they may face, including internet education. As internet usage becomes more widespread across the region, more children will become vulnerable to online ""grooming"" and exploitation through sexual abuse materials and the online streaming of child sexual abuse, the report added. Protection in this area must encompass a wide range of actors beyond law enforcement, such as parents, schools and teachers, the UNODC noted. ""The online environment of the 21st century has transformed criminality in various ways: as an advanced vehicle for communications, it has created a transnational environment that provides new opportunities for organising and participating in harmful activities, and the virtual nature of the online environment means criminal activity can sometimes fall outside the jurisdiction of the criminal justice process,"" it said. The report also noted that those involved in ""child sex tourism"" were not only tourists but could also be business travellers, foreigners working directly with children and other vulnerable groups, military personnel posted abroad, diplomats and government employees, expatriates or foreign nationals on extended travel, and retired expats residing abroad.",OVAC

UNICEF says the study entitled ""Hidden in Plain Sight"" is the largest-ever study of violence against children, drawing on data from 190 countries	 Drawing on data from 190 countries, the global report by child welfare agency UNICEF is billed as the largest-ever study of violence against children. Entitled ""Hidden in Plain Sight"" it also revealed that one fifth of all murder victims are children and teens, with homicide the leading cause of death among male youths in Latin American countries including Venezuela, Colombia, Panama and Brazil. ""These are uncomfortable facts -- no government or parent will want to see them,"" said UNICEF Executive Director Anthony Lake. ""But unless we confront the reality each infuriating statistic represents -- the life of a child whose right to a safe, protected childhood has been violated -- we will never change the mind-set that violence against children is normal and permissible. It is neither."" Sexual violence against children has far-reaching consequences, the study warned, potentially hindering all aspects of their physical, social and psychological development. The consequences of abuse included self-harming behaviors such as bulimia and anorexia. ""Children who have been abused are also more likely to attempt suicide; the more severe the violence, the greater the risk,"" the study said. The mental health consequences include depression, panic disorder, anxiety and nightmares. ""The psychological impact of sexual violence can be severe due to the shame, secrecy and stigma that tend to accompany it, with child victims often having to find ways to cope in isolation.""   - Online predators -   UNICEF also warned the Internet skills of today's children can have the pernicious effect of opening them up to online sexual abuse. Youths feel safer sharing personal and sensitive information online than in other spheres. But in doing so they may expose themselves to a global audience including potential sexual predators, the report said. The practice of grooming -- online solicitation of children for sexual purposes, sometimes over a period of time to build trust -- is a peril facing Internet-savvy kids. Some research suggests perpetrators may keep online connections with as many as 200 youths at a time, all at different stages of grooming, the study said. While sexual violence was more common in poor countries, it was by no means limited to them, with worryingly high rates of abuse reported in some high-income states. In Britain for instance the report highlighted a 2009 study that found around 17 percent of youths aged 11 to 17 to have experienced contact or non-contact sexual abuse by an adult or peer at some point in their life. And a study conducted in 2011 in the United States found that 35 percent of adolescent girls and 20 percent of adolescent boys aged 14 to 17 reported suffering some form of sexual violence during their lives, UNICEF said.   - Tackling mindsets -   Other abuses include bullying, which regularly affected more than one in three schoolchildren aged 13 to 15 worldwide. And as for violent discipline, the study found that about 17 percent of youngsters in 58 countries were subject to severe forms of physical punishment, including being hit on the head, ears or face or being hit hard and repeatedly. The UN report also tackles the mindsets it says perpetuate and justify such violence. It recommended six strategies for preventing violence against children. They include ""supporting parents and equipping children with life skills; changing attitudes; strengthening judicial, criminal and social systems and services; and generating evidence and awareness about violence and its human and socio-economic costs, in order to change attitudes and norms.""

European Union nations are not doing enough to protect children in the digital world and need to upgrade hotline systems, social networking awareness and age-rating, the EU executive said Tuesday.	 A European Commission report said existing recommendations to safeguard children ""have been insufficient overall"" and that new proposals will be issued later in the year. With children going online from age seven, ""we urgently need to step up a gear on what we do and how we work together to empower and protect children in this ever changing digital world,"" said Digital Agenda Commissioner Neelie Kroes. The report notably urged the 27 EU states to improve awareness of hotlines and privacy risks on social networking sites as well as making better use of age-rating systems to prevent the under-age sale of video games. It said one out of three children aged 9-12, and three out of four teenagers aged 13-16, who use the Internet have a profile on a social networking site. In June, the commission said sites such as Facebook were not doing enough to protect children from potential dangers such as grooming by paedophiles or online bullying. Of 14 websites tested on behalf of the European Commission, just two -- Bebo and MySpace -- ensured the required controls to make sure ""potential strangers"" cannot gain access to profiles. A survey earlier this year showed one in five children under 13 manage to dodge Facebook's age restriction.",OVAC

											Australian gets life in Philippine child sex abuse case										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/1485061/australian-gets-life-in-philippine-child-sex-abuse-case,"MANILA: An Australian man has been sentenced to life in a Philippine prison as part of a notorious child sexual abuse case in which prosecutors say he chained the victims like dogs. Peter Scully still faces another trial and dozens more charges, including allegations he made child pornography and murdered a young girl. The Philippines has become a key hub for a billion-dollar, global child cybersex industry, police have warned, with operators helped by widespread poverty. Scully was convicted Wednesday of trafficking and rape by a court in the southern Philippines, three years after he was arrested there and accused of sexually abusing and filming girls including an 18-month-old baby. The Cagayan de Oro court sentenced Scully and his Filipina partner to life in prison without parole and imposed a fine of 5 million pesos ($93,700) for trafficking Filipina girls then aged 10 and 12, the regional prosecutor said. ""This is a big victory for us. This sends a very strong signal to traffickers that this government is serious in pursuing and prosecuting these cases,"" Merlynn Uy, officer-in-charge of the regional prosecutor's office, told AFP. ""These girls were lured into his apartment and they said that they were chained on the neck, like dogs on a leash."" Scully was also found guilty of rape, which carries a minimum of six years behind bars. He was arrested in 2015 in Malaybalay, another southern Philippine city, after fleeing from Australia in 2011. He had come to the Philippines to escape fraud charges in his home country. He then set up a cybersex business, filming teenage girls from impoverished families as he had sex with them or used sex toys, investigators said. The videos were allegedly sold to customers in Germany, the United States and Brazil. Most of the people who pay to view these types of sex videos are abroad, with potentially thousands of children being abused, often with their parents' consent, authorities said. Scully faces another trial for a second batch of 60 charges including the rape of an 18-month-old baby girl and the rape and murder of a 12-year-old girl. It is not clear when those proceedings will start. The Social Welfare Department said Scully's victims remained in government custody. ""The children have been traumatised. We provide them therapy to help them prepare for a normal life,"" regional social welfare director Nestor Ramos told AFP. Australia's foreign affairs department told AFP it was providing consular assistance to Scully but declined to comment further citing ""privacy obligations"".",OVAC

											Philippine police make more child cybersex arrests, rescues										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/1248322/philippine-police-make-more-child-cybersex-arrests-rescues,"MANILA -- Authorities in the Philippines have rescued four girls and arrested a mother and two other women for allegedly livestreaming sexually exploitative videos of children to men paying by the minute to watch from the United States. Three sisters ages 8, 9 and 12, and an 11-year-old found in a separate rescue, are now in a shelter for abused children while the women face prosecution. The arrests came just two weeks after Filipino authorities raided the home of an American man suspected of similar cybersex crimes, arresting David Timothy Deakin, 53, in his townhouse. During that bust, agents from the National Bureau of Investigation rescued two girls, 10 and 12, who had spent time in Mr Deakin's home, and made one of the largest seizures of illicit digital content in the Philippines. Dozens of hard drives and a handful of computers must now be analysed to search for other possible victims, as well as buyers. Mr Deakin denied wrongdoing. “They got it twisted around like somehow I was using those girls,'' he told The Associated Press after his April 20 arrest. The series of arrests and rescues underscore a rapidly growing crime in which children, even toddlers, are made to remove their clothes and touch themselves in obscene ways while adults, often their parents, train video cameras on them in exchange for payment from paedophiles abroad. Police in the Philippines are collaborating with their counterparts in Europe, Australia and the US to investigate and prosecute. The Australian Federal Police and US FBI separately provided Filipino authorities information that led to the arrests of the mother and two other women on May 5, rescuing four girls. They were allegedly making the girls engage in sexually explicit acts while men in Australia and the US watched. The women have been charged with human trafficking, child abuse, child pornography and cybercrime. Police officer Arlyn Torrendon said she was part of a team that rescued three of the children and arrested the three women, including the mother of the siblings, Friday in a house in Bacolod city on an island about 717 kilometres south of Manila. “The children were innocent. They were not even aware that they were being used in a crime,'' Ms Torrendon told the AP by telephone from Bacolod. She said the children came from an impoverished family; their mother was a widow. Gen. Liborio Carabbacan at the National Police Women and Children Protection Centre said the incidents are increasing in the Philippines because many people are gaining access to the internet and English fluency is common, making it possible to communicate with would-be customers. Also, he said, parents and relatives, motivated by greed, are often not even aware that it is against the law to exploit their children. The livestream abuse happens in many of Philippines' densely populated, impoverished neighbourhoods, said attorney Gideon Cauton, who works with the non-profit International Justice Mission. The organization provides social workers, shelters, lawyers and even former US police detectives to local law enforcement, who don't have enough resources to tackle all cases of online sexual exploitation of children. In metropolitan Manila, where gleaming condominium high-rises and stores selling designer clothes and cars stand in stark contrast to the squalor of the slums, Mr Cauton pointed to Wi-Fi antennas rising from rooftops above a long stretch of shanties and rundown houses. In the past, the antennas amid crushing poverty were red flags, sparking suspicion of cybersex crimes. Today pocket Wi-Fi, mobile internet and other technology have rendered those irrelevant, driving the crime even further behind the scenes. “This type of crime is really hidden,'' he said. “Usually the family and community, they are complicit, and these are tight-knit communities, very dense areas.'' In the US, the proliferation of crimes, along with new mandatory reporting, led to 8.2 million reports last year to the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children's CyberTipline related to online child sexual exploitation. That compares with 8.3 million reports in the 17 years prior. One of those reports led authorities in the US to Karl Touset, 72, of Marietta, Georgia, who was sentenced to prison for 10 years in March after Homeland Security Investigations agents found evidence on his computers that he had paid facilitators in the Philippines more than $55,000 over three years for images of girls being sexually exploited. “Unfortunately, extreme poverty in many parts of the world affords individuals like Touset the opportunity to exploit children across national borders,'' said US Attorney John Horn in a statement after the sentencing.",OVAC

											Big child webcam sex bust in Philippines										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/special-reports/1246462/big-child-webcam-sex-bust-in-philippines,"MABALACAT, Philippines -- The suspected paedophile could see people banging on his front door through his security cameras. Were they neighbours? Cops? One had letters on her jacket. As David Timothy Deakin googled “What is NBI?'' from the laptop on his bed, the Philippines National Bureau of Investigation smashed their way into his cybersex den. Children's underwear, toddler shoes, cameras, bondage cuffs, fetish ropes, meth pipes and stacks of hard drives and photo albums cluttered the stuffy, two-bedroom townhouse. Pencilled on the wall, someone had scrawled “My Mom and Dad love me'' and a broken heart. In his computer were videos and images of young boys and girls engaged in sex acts. “Why is everyone asking about children coming into my house?'' said Mr Deakin, 53, his wrists bound with a zip tie. Mr Deakin's arrest April 20 reveals one of the darkest corners of the internet, where paedophiles in the US, Canada, Europe and Australia pay facilitators on the other side of the world to sexually abuse children, even babies, directing their moves through online livestreaming services. The relatively new crime of webcam sex tourism is spreading rapidly, with new digital technologies sparking what the United Nations calls an “alarming growth of new forms of child sexual exploitation online''. The FBI says it's epidemic, and that at any given moment, 750,000 child predators are online. Almost every case stems from the Philippines, where good English speakers, increased internet connections and widespread international cash transfer systems combine with widespread poverty and easy access to vulnerable kids. There have been as many as three busts a week there this spring. The youngest victim ever, rescued a few weeks ago, was an infant, two months old. Most are under 12. This spring The Associated Press watched a raid, rescue and launch of a major investigation that continues to play out on both sides of the world. “This should serve as a warning,'' said NBI Anti-human trafficking chief Janet Francisco, who leads the case. “We will really catch them, with the help of our foreign counterparts. We will really put them in jail and they will die in jail.'' ____ In this April 20, 2017, photo, a young girl's shirt, a cowboy hat and pictures of suspected child webcam cybersex operator, David Timothy Deakin, lay on the floor during a raid in Mabalacat, Philippines. (AP photo) Bare-chested and slick with sweat, his breath sour and glasses foggy, Mr Deakin watched agents --including FBI computer analysts  -- crouch on his bed over open computers, rushing to find and preserve hidden files. The tip that led authorities to Mr Deakin came, as they often do, when an online international money transfer service notified an American internet provider about a suspicious account. Western Union, PayPal, and others have reported concerns in the past -- business names in this case are being withheld because of the ongoing investigation. Records in Mr Deakin's town house included debit cards for money transfer services, including Smart Money and Payoneer. The raid began just before dawn, as seven vanloads of police, investigators, lawyers and social workers rolled out of Manila, past rice paddies and water buffalos, and into a town that was once a large US military base, now a major red light district. The vans passed Fields Avenue, a notorious street lined with bars, strip clubs and massage parlours; shops advertise Viagra and lingerie-clad women beckon customers. When they reached Mr Deakin's apartment, a small cadre went to his door. Even as they burst in, he was streaming illicit content through the Tor network, which disguised his identity. Agents said he had a webpage open to wipe his phone clean. They tied him up with the first thing they could grab, an iPhone charging cord, before he could hit the button. “I'm a file pack rat”, said Mr Deakin. “I've got files of frigging everything”. AP and investigators asked him repeatedly why he had images of children engaged in sexual acts on his computer and bondage and fetish tools in his apartment. “I'm just a costumer'', he said at first, as if the leather wrist restraints and ropes in the second bedroom were just for dress-up. “I'm schizophrenic, you know”, he later told AP, looping his finger at his temple. He described a series of houseguests, people he let crash in his small place from down the street, other countries. Perhaps “some Danish guy'' used his computer. And this: “There was no children in front of the cam in my house, not even dressed, as far as I know, not even with their frigging mothers as far as I know.'' At one point, he told AP the images might have inadvertently slipped in when he downloaded massive files using BitTorrent. BitTorrent is a data tool used legitimately by academics and artists, but also by child pornographers and other criminals because large amounts of digital content can be moved and sorted. FBI agents looking for abusers search BitTorrent to spot people sharing exploitive images. Hours after his arrest, wrists tied behind his back, Mr Deakin grew nervous. Suspected child webcam cybersex operator David Timothy Deakin has his hands tied behind his back with an iPhone charging cord as members of the National Bureau of Investigation Anti-human Trafficking division arrest him inside his home during a raid in Mabalacat, Philippines. (AP photo) “I don't even know what you're frigging doing here!'' he yelled. Mr Deakin grew up in Peoria, Illinois, he said, “around the corn fields”. His family was splintered, his sister hated him and he didn't finish high school, he said. He was licensed as a roofing contractor in his 30s, seasonal work which left winters free; he used the time to study computers. Illinois court records show Mr Deakin was arrested on marijuana and drunken driving charges several times before visiting the Philippines in 1998. Two years later, he moved there for a job setting up internet service providers and installing Blackmagic livestreaming production programs. “The office computers were full of pornography”, Mr Deakin would write to Filipino authorities three years later, when an inter-office argument led to immigration charges. The charges were dismissed, and he was supposed to leave the country. But he stayed, remotely running computer systems for clients around the world, and hosting, he said, tens of thousands of websites as well. In recent years, Mr Deakin said, he earned $30 an hour as a systems administrator. But his home was filled with junk, his refrigerator near empty. Stacks of used egg cartons fell from the shelves, and a half-eaten pot of cold rice sat on the stove. “You know what you've done in this room”, an investigator told Mr Deakin. She showed him a photo he had of several children. Shrugging, he said one of them was probably a few doors away with her cousin. Minutes later, two girls, 9 and 11 years old, were rescued by police. AP did not interview the girls Mr Deakin told police about; victims of such raids need immediate and long-term counselling and care. But in the tranquil garden of a shelter for sexual exploitation survivors about 60 miles south of Mr Deakin's town house, 19-year-old Cassie described her ordeal. AP did not use her whole name to protect her privacy. The youngest daughter in an impoverished family of 14, Cassie believed the man who came to her village and promised her a better life and family support if she would go to the city with him. When he told her he would be selling her, she had no idea what that meant. “I was laughing”, she said. Cassie was 12. Within months the man bleached her dark skin, straightened her hair, and began waking her at 4am to meet customers. She started working as a cybersex model. “He needed some girl to show her whole body in front of the camera”, she said. He told her it was her job, in exchange for an education. Over time, six more girls came to live in the house, and one had a baby. At school Cassie tried to act normal, hiding her secret from classmates. At home she was terrified and thinking about suicide. The abuse ended when her older sister found out. Furious, she went to the police. Dolores Rubia, who runs aftercare programs for rescued girls through Washington DC-based NGO International Justice Mission , said parents and relatives turn to online exploitation to for easy money. Some consider it benign, she said, because they think children don't mind taking off their clothes. But that exposure is abuse, and it often escalates. “It's a myth for some of them, that nothing is wrong”, she said. “That anyway, these children are not physically touched and the perpetrators are actually overseas”. Buyers abroad also sometimes try to use the lack of contact as an excuse for their crimes. “The people I was talking to were hurting people, hurting children in a way that I would never have allowed in my presence”, said Scott Peeler, a former Southbridge, Massachusetts middle school maths teacher who admitted he tried to buy live video feeds of children having sex in the Philippines. “I drifted into a world that repulses me”, he said. Mr Peeler was sentenced in March to 11 years in federal prison. “It's not just a virtual crime. It is an actual crime”, said human rights attorney Sam Inocencio, who heads International Justice Mission's Philippines office, which supports local law enforcement with investigators and attorneys. “Online sexual exploitation is possibly the most evil thing that I've seen.'' ___ Bondage cuffs used for sexual acts during a raid at the home of suspected child webcam cybersex operator, David Timothy Deakin, in Mabalacat, Philippines. (AP photo) The first high-profile international case of livestreaming sexual exploitation of children was reported in 2011 out of the Philippines. The proliferation of smart phones and wi-fi have led to rapid growth. Perpetrators now use bitcoin or untraceable credit cards. By livestreaming, they bypass digital markers law enforcement embeds in illegal content to catch people downloading, sharing or saving child pornography on computers or in the Cloud. Once isolated, paedophiles now operate with virtual anonymity, sharing images and children, say experts. In 2013, online sex exploitation of children gained global attention after researchers at the Netherlands-based non-profit Terre des Hommes launched a realistic-looking animation of a 10-year-old Filipino girl named Sweetie. They took the fake girl on chat groups and online forums. Paedophiles swarmed. In 10 weeks, analysts identified 1,000 men in 71 countries who had tried to get illegal images. Last year, UK-based Internet Watch Foundation worked to remove 57,335 URLs with child sexual abuse imagery. The websites were hosted on 2,416 domains, up from 1,991 in 2015. The proliferation of crimes, along with new mandatory reporting, led to 8.2 million reports last year to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children's CyberTipline related to online child sexual exploitation. That compares with 8.3 million reports in the 17 years prior. One of those reports led analysts to a four-time convicted sex offender, Louis Francis Bradley, 66, of Baltimore, Maryland, last year. He had paid at least 17 people in the Philippines to take sexually explicit photos of prepubescent girls and share them with him on Facebook. He also admitted in March to paying women to expose their genitals using video streaming programs. “can u get any really young girls'' he asked in one online chat. Mr Bradley was sentenced May 2 to 35 years in prison. Because it's a newer crime, legal systems grapple with how to prosecute. In the US, the buyers are typically charged with possessing, distributing or producing child pornography. In the Philippines, it's a human trafficking crime. In 2015, five people were convicted of online child sex trafficking in the Philippines. Mr Deakin has been charged with cybercrime, child pornography, child abuse and child trafficking. Officials at both ends of the abuse agree they need to collaborate to stop it, and last month the US committed $3 million. Philippines National Police Gen Liborioi Carabbacan said they're trying to raise public awareness, letting parents and children know it's illegal. One woman forced into prostitution as a child turned the cameras on her own kids when she grew up, he said. “She thought that's already the norm”, he said. ___ Mr Deakin's bust turned out to be one of the largest seizures of its kind in the Philippines, and also a first for investigators on the case who caught the suspect in the act. His Cheery Mobile Touch HD tablet -- which can be wiped clean and reset with a four digit code --  had more than 4,000 contacts. One computer had another 13 networked into it, from servers he said around the world. There were 30 hard drives. “The suspect is really a highly technical person, he is computer savvy, so he was able to hide several computers within the computer,'' said Chief Francisco. Investigators hope digital forensics will lead them to rescue dozens, possibly hundreds, of victims. And they expect to catch more conspirators in the wider syndicate, both in the Philippines and abroad. Neighbours who gathered to watch the raid knew something was wrong in that house. “No, no, not drugs”, said a man who rolled up on a bike. “Computers. Sex. Children.'' Josue Santos, who patrols the neighbourhood on foot, said he saw seven children, 3 boys and 4 girls, heading into Mr Deakin's home one evening a few months ago. Others nodded. Bessie Geronimo, across the street, was teary-eyed. She'd seen children going in and out. Now, she wondered, could she have intervened? “How could they do such a thing?'' she asked. “Oh, I pity those children.'' Authorities from a village police substation said a housekeeper filed a complaint against Mr Deakin last year: he wasn't paying her, she said, and she was worried about what he was doing with children in the bedroom with the door closed. They visited his house but had no authority for a raid. “There are many such places”, said security officer Mike Wood. Before Mr Deakin was taken to jail, he asked for a cigarette. He asked to use the bathroom. He asked for his Bible. And he said he'd been planning to leave town. Just one day earlier, he had texted a friend: “I've got to get out of here”.",OVAC

											New tech fuels 'global boom' in child sex tourism										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/970249/new-tech-fuels-global-boom-in-child-sex-tourism,"Technology is transforming the global sex trade and making it easier than ever for travellers to prey on children, a landmark study on paedophiles warned Thursday. Researchers say the spread of communications technology is facilitating child abuse at every step The UN-backed report, released in Bangkok, shines a light on the rampant spread of child sex tourism, a scourge that touches every corner of the world and is outpacing all efforts to contain it. It is entitled, Global Study on Sexual Exploitation of Children in Travel and Tourism. Researchers say the spread of communications technology is facilitating abuse at every step -- by helping offenders groom and procure children on the internet before they arrive, network among themselves and share or even livestream images of abuse. ""With the click of a button, offenders can have children 'delivered' to their hotel room or anywhere else they choose,"" the report says. Paedophiles can now speak directly to victims, using social media channels, with an immediacy ""that was impossible 20 years ago,"" it adds. In a country like South Korea, where advanced communication technologies are widespread, more than 95% of commercial sexual exploitation of children is arranged over the Internet, according to researchers. Shadowy digital spaces are also offering abusers thicker layers of anonymity, with tools like cloud computing and encryption reducing their visibility and risk of arrest. ""Thanks to the increasing use of the so-called 'dark net', predators can securely post, view and exchange child abuse materials produced during their trips through networks that are difficult to detect"", the report said. New inventions in tech have also transformed the nature of abuse itself. In the Philippines, identified as a key hub in Southeast Asia for organised cybersex, tens of thousands of children are believed to have been exploited by ""webcam child sex tourism"", which involves children performing sexual acts in front of a camera directed by the abuser. The take-off of the ""sharing economy"" has also freed up new, more private places for travellers to abuse children, with sites like Airbnb inadvertently offering further insulation from the public eye. The report writers called on tech companies to ""take a lead"" in developing solutions to undermine online business deals, such as programs that can track or block payments. The study was compiled by more than 70 child protection agencies, charities and academics. It bills itself as the most comprehensive review of how child sex tourism has evolved in the last two decades.",OVAC

Philippine police accuse Scully of repeatedly raping the two teenage girls, who were found naked and chained in his apartment bedroom in the southern port last year. Scully is also under investigation, but not been charged, over the rape of an 18-month-old baby girl and the rape and murder of a 12-year-old girl. Police said they found the 12-year-old's remains in February, buried beneath the kitchen of a separate apartment also rented by Scully in the southern city of Surigao. Scully was arrested in the same month in Malaybalay, another southern Philippine city. Scully, reported in Australian media as a native of Melbourne,  fled to the Philippines from Australia in 2011 after he was charged with fraud, according to Philippine investigators. He then set up a cybersex business, filming girls aged 12 to 18 from impoverished families as he had sex with them or they played with sex toys, the investigators added. The videos were allegedly sold to customers in Germany, the US and Brazil. Philippine police also said he is under a separate criminal investigation in the Netherlands over fraud.

The other five children are also thought to come from the local area. The Philippines, where poor children are easy prey, has become a major hub for the billion-dollar global cybersex industry. Online child abuse was the leading cyber-related crime in the Philippines last year, making up 46% of the 200 reported cases, according to the justice department. Villanueva allegedly charged customers in the United States, Britain, Australia and Japan between $50-100 to watch the children having sex, Nuqui said.

But Fabro warned that an undetermined number may have escaped before the raid. ""There are other targets but we weren't able to get them,"" she told AFP. About 400 people from Hong Kong, Singapore and Macau were targeted by the group and the arrests were made due to complaints from victims, Fabro said. The suspects operated from towns in Bulacan province, about 30 kilometres (17 miles) from Manila. They used social media websites such as Facebook to meet people overseas and then used video call services such as Skype to engage in ""cybersex,"" the police said. ""Unknown to the victim, these acts were recorded. Once the suspect captured sufficiently lewd video footages, he/she would stop the call instantly. Immediately, the victim would receive messages... from the suspect, threatening the victim that his lewd acts were video recorded with a video link to prove it,"" the cybercrime division said in a statement. The suspect would then demand the victim pay a huge amount or the footage would be made public on social media or even sent to the victim's friends or relatives, the division said. Each victim would usually be forced to pay about $30,000 but Fabro said she could not immediately give a figure for the total gained from the ""sextortion"". Initially, the group used women but later recruited five minors who were taught to lure other victims. The minors have since been turned over to social workers, said Fabro adding that the suspects would be charged with human trafficking along with extortion. Fabro also said they were still investigating whether this new group was related to a larger but similar ""sextortion"" operation that was broken up by police in May. In that case, dozens of people  operating from industrial-sized call centres were arrested after allegedly blackmailing hundreds of people around the world, luring them on social media in order to get sexually explicit information or images. One of their victims was a 17-year-old boy in Scotland who committed suicide last year. This newest operation ""is more mobile. If they have a strong enough Internet connection, they just do it from their homes,"" Fabro said. Interpol has warned that ""sextortion"" has  emerged as a major concern in recent years as criminals take advantage of more people using social media and greater mobile Internet access via smartphones.",OVAC

											Online extortion gang busted										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/428198/online-extortionists-arrested,"MANILA: Philippine police have arrested eight suspected members of a gang accused of blackmailing more than 1,000 Hong Kong and Singapore residents after luring them into exposing themselves in front of webcams. The raid on the syndicate's locations in northern Bulacan province was a follow-up to an operation backed by Interpol in April in which 58 Filipinos were arrested, and another 100 linked to the extortion in a subsequent investigation in May. The victims came from all over the world, including a Scottish teenager who committed suicide after being blackmailed. Five Filipino teenagers employed as ""chatters"" who befriended victims through social media sites including Facebook were turned over to social workers, said the head of the police anti-cybercrime group, Gilbert Sosa. Victims would be lured into cybersex on Skype, recorded and a video link sent to their Facebook accounts unless they paid at least $3,000, he said. The gang has victimised around 700 Hong Kong residents and nearly the same number of Singaporeans in a span of two years, Sosa sais on Friday. The latest police operation was conducted in cooperation with Interpol based in Hong Kong and Singapore. Among those arrested was a suspected ringleader. Investigators found out that the woman's daughter owns two money transfer branches in Bulacan where the victims were asked to deposit their payment, Sosa said. The suspects are facing charges of robbery with extortion and violation of the anti-human trafficking law. The crackdown in the Philippines was partly sparked by information that a 17-year-old mechanic in Scotland, Daniel Perry, took his own life in July last year after being victimised by a Filipino extortion group. The BBC has reported that Perry killed himself after being warned that his video conversations would be circulated to his friends and family if he didn't pay. Three of the 58 Filipino suspects arrested in April were believed to have victimised Perry, who jumped off a bridge, police said.",OVAC

An employee of the National Bureau of Investigation carries confiscated desktop computers allegedly used for cybersex crime, at the NBI headquarters in Manila on January 29, 2014	 The raids came after police said this month the Philippines had become a major source of pornographic content in the fast-growing child cybersex industry, and vowed to crack down on those involved. The raids took place overnight Tuesday on two Manila businesses that used nude pictures of children, as well as adults, to entice people online to subscribe to pornographic websites, the National Bureau of Investigation said. ""They were caught in flagrante (in the act of wrongdoing),"" Ronald Aguto, head of the bureau's cybercrime unit, told AFP, in reference to the 11 Filipinos who had been detained. ""Some of the computers contained child pornography as well as adult pornography."" Some of the nude photographs on the computers were of unidentified Filipino children aged about 12-16, according to Aguto. He said the suspects faced potential child pornography and human trafficking charges against the suspects, although authorities still needed to investigate the case further. Aguto said the business model involved staff chatting online with people overseas, showing them pornographic photos, in a bid to lure them into buying website subscriptions. The businesses received a commission of $5 for each subscription, and together cleared more than $8,000 a day, according to Aguto. The government pledge to crack down on child cybersex operations came after British and Australian police announced this month they had dismantled a paedophile ring that streamed live sexual abuse of Filipino children over the Internet. Philippine police subsequently said the country was one of the world's biggest sources of live streaming of child sex abuse, with children performing acts in front of webcams to online paedophiles in an industry worth billions of dollars. Poverty and the promise of easy money had seen some Filipino parents allowing their children to be abused online for the paying audience, they added.

											Horror in Philippine online child sex abuse village										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/391558/horror-in-philippine-online-child-sex-abuse-village,"In a remote Philippine village, toddlers played oblivious at a nursery as the house next door became part of a horrifying child pornography ring, with live footage of children performing sex acts being streamed online to paedophiles around the world. Mothers accompany their children to a day care center, next to the now abandoned house (back) that used to streamed live sex acts of children to paedophiles around the world, in Ibabao village, Cebu provnce, in central Philippines on January 21, 2014	 The depraved scenes in the bungalow were being repeated in many homes throughout Ibabao, a secluded community on Cebu island where Internet child pornography had for some of its 5,000 residents become more lucrative than fishing or factory work. ""In the beginning I was shocked, I could not believe this was happening in my town,"" mayor Adelino Sitoy told AFP last week, shortly after police announced they had cracked a global live-streaming paedophile ring in which Ibabao was a key source of the child pornography. But while the village is currently in the spotlight, authorities and child rights advocates say the fast-growing global industry is infecting many parts of the mostly poor Philippines, with thousands of children having been abused. At first look the coastal community of Ibabao, 550 kilometres (340 miles) south of Manila, is a typical close-knit rural Philippine village, where many of the long-time residents are relatives or enjoy close and longstanding ties.  In scenes echoed across the devoutly Catholic Philippines, its residents regularly attend masses held in quaint chapels along narrow footpaths and dirt roads. But police and authorities said that behind the closed doors of the tiny wooden and brick homes, many parents directed their children for sex videos in front of webcams connected via the Internet to paying paedophiles overseas. Other children were lured into the homes of neighbours and forced to perform sex acts in front of webcams, they said. Sitoy said the trade thrived because children were locked secretly inside homes, as well as Ibabao's remote location and the fact some elected village leaders with relatives involved ignored the crimes. But some of the videos eventually found their way into the computer files of a known British paedophile two years ago, triggering a global manhunt to track down the perpetrators. The British man was convicted in March last year and sentenced to eight years in prison. Shortly afterwards police in the Philippines began carrying out raids in Ibabao and nearby areas with the help of British, Australian and US authorities. One of the raids saw dozens of Filipino police and social workers break into the bungalow next to the day care centre in September last year, arresting a couple and rescuing their three children, aged three, nine and 11. Two days later, 13 other children who were being abused in other Ibabao homes were rescued, according to Philippine police. Residents are generally wary of outsiders but some allowed AFP to interview them on condition of anonymity. They said ""cybersex dens"" remained in operation, but security fears and the Filipino tradition of not interfering with a neighbour's affairs helped to ensure that people did not pry further or try to stop it. Housewife Jennifer Canete, 38, was willing to talk openly about the crimes, confirming many people in the community were involved and that she feared her four young children could become victims. Canete said one of her children attended the nursery located next to the house where the three children were being abused. ""We were angry that this could happen just near the day care,"" she said. ""I was also afraid, we didn't know what could happen to our children if they went to school because there were many here who were doing that."" Authorities say they do not know exactly when the trade arrived in Ibabao. But, according to local social workers, a Filipina woman from outside the community believed to belong to an organised crime group relocated to the village several years ago and introduced locals to the get-rich-quick scheme. That woman taught residents how to scout for clients in pornographic chat rooms and receive payments through international money transfers, according to the social workers, who did not want to be named for security reasons. Some operators lured friends of their children into their homes and abused them, threatening to harm their parents if they told anyone, the social workers said. One parent told AFP a neighbour who had tried to recruit her said clients paid as much as 100 dollars a session, a fortune in a region where the minimum daily wage is the equivalent of about seven dollars. She said the neighbour justified the trade by saying that no actual physical contact took place.  ""I was angry. We were always taught to protect and love our children,"" the woman said. ""We are not rich, but we are also not poor and desperate. It was an evil thing to do."" Nevertheless, she said that staying silent and steering clear of those involved in the trade was the best thing to do, to avoid any trouble. In announcing the dismantling of the paedophile network, Britain's National Crime Agency said in mid-January that 11 people had been arrested in the Philippines and 18 elsewhere around the world.  Another 733 suspects were being investigated, the agency added. Andrey Sawchenko, Philippine head of the Washington-based International Justice Mission (IJM) who helped in the arrests, said 39 children had been rescued in Ibabao and elsewhere in the Philippines. But this is widely believed to be just the tip of the iceberg, with the British crime agency describing online child sex abuse as a ""significant and emerging threat"".  ""Extreme poverty, the increasing availability of high speed Internet and the existence of a vast and comparatively wealthy overseas customer base has led to organised crime groups exploiting children for financial gain,"" it said. Dutch advocate group Terre des Hommes estimates that ""tens of thousands"" of children are being abused through the cybersex industry just in the Philippines.  Last year, the group created a virtual 10-year-old Filipina girl that was deployed in Internet chat rooms to lure paedophiles. Over 10 weeks, 20,000 people from 71 countries approached the fake girl asking for sexual performances, according to Terre des Hommes, which passed the details of the paedophiles onto police. ",OVAC

Filipino children walk together with their parents during an anti-child pornography protest march in Manila, on March 10, 2009	 Police in Britain, Australia and the Philippines Thursday said they had jointly cracked a paedophile ring which exploited children as young as six. In some cases the victims' parents were involved. ""We will not countenance any syndicates that will (prey) on our minors and that they will be used... as sexual instruments. That is something that we will really pound the hammer on,"" President Benigno Aquino's spokesman Edwin Lacierda told reporters. ""Certainly, actions will be taken to address the situation. This is really a concern for us because we've always said that the youth is (the) future of the nation,"" he added. Lacierda conceded that the problem had been ""under the radar"" but said law-enforcement agencies were now placing greater emphasis on fighting the crime. Authorities are checking tourist establishments to ensure they are not catering to foreign paedophiles, and  parents who push their children into abuse will be prosecuted by the government, he warned. He also said that an anti-cybercrime law -- passed in September 2012 but later blocked by the Supreme Court -- could have helped the Philippines in its efforts to tackle the crime.  The court is still hearing a legal challenge over the law's provisions on online libel and giving the state the power to shut down websites and monitor online activities. Lacierda said the law's provisions were ""a ticklish issue"" but expressed hope that telecommunications companies and officials could reach an agreement over how to proceed.

""We are the origin, the source,"" Sosa, head of the Philippine National Police's anti-cybercrime unit, told a news conference, adding the industry spread rapidly across the country last year. Police in Britain, Australia and the Philippines announced on Thursday that they had jointly dismantled a paedophile ring that streamed live sexual abuse of Filipino children as young as six over the Internet. In some cases, the victims' parents were involved. Fifteen victims aged between six and 15 have been rescued, Britain's National Crime Agency said on Thursday, adding that 29 people had been arrested, including 11 in the Philippines. Three other ongoing investigations have identified 733 suspects, the agency added. Sosa said the Philippines is a ""top 10"" purveyor of what he described as a global ""cottage industry (worth) billions of dollars"". The victims are mostly younger than 18, he said, recounting how he took part in some police raids in the northern city of Angeles, where boys and girls aged between 10 and 14 performed ""lewd acts"" in front of cameras. Some of the suspects arrested are Americans or Europeans, with Filipino ""cohorts"", he said. In Manila, he said the streaming is done inside hotel rooms. It is also done in 31 of the Philippines' 81 provinces, with Angeles, the central city of Cebu and the southern city of Cagayan de Oro being the other main sites. The police official said some of the streaming is done inside shanties in the sprawling slums of the Philippines, a country of 100 million where one in four people live on less than a dollar a day, according to government data. ""The parents themselves facilitate the children's participation,"" Sosa said, adding their earnings help support the families. Video streaming earned them at least $100 an hour, and photo sessions were worth up to 3,000 pesos (about $66), he added. Sosa said most people who pay to view the activity are from the United States and Europe. ""There is no interest in child pornography in our culture. So it is mostly production."" Sosa said the crime had spread through the help of wireless technology where users cannot be effectively tracked by law enforcers. The Philippine passed a law in September 2012 meant to stamp out cybercrimes including fraud, identity theft, spamming, and child pornography. But the Supreme Court blocked the statute before it could take effect amid a legal challenge that it has yet to rule on. Opponents objected to provisions that would authorise heavy prison terms for online libel, and give the state the power to shut down websites and monitor online activities. ""Under that law, telcos (telecommunications firms) are required to retain their data or log files within a period of six months. Since there is a temporary restraining order, there is no legal basis for them to comply,"" Sosa said. Ronald Aguto, cybercrime division chief of the justice department's National Bureau of Investigation, said Filipino law enforcers are making do with other laws to go after offenders, including one against child pornography. However, he said these were not enough. ""In these matters, time is of the essence. We need to swiftly get the data from Internet providers,"" he said in an interview over local DZBB radio. ",OVAC

The bill also defines ""computer-related offences"" for forgery, fraud, identity theft, cybersex and child pornography. Spamming as well as ""cyber-squatting"" -- the use of an Internet domain name to mislead consumers, destroy other's reputations or prevent them from using their name -- were included in the bill. The law also punishes libel, Valte said, though asked if this would cover even messages sent on social network websites such as Twitter, she added the state would ""leave it up to other lawyers to determine"".  The bill also calls for the creation of a ""Cybercrime Investigation and Coordinating Center"" that will implement the law, she said. Valte did not say what penalties will be imposed for different offences under the new law. In 2000, two Filipino computer students were accused of releasing the ""ILOVEYOU"" computer virus that infected computers worldwide, destroying millions of computer files and causing millions of dollars in damage.

The film, known as ""Cuties"" in English, is directed by French-Senegalese director Maimouna Doucoure, and started streaming September 9. More than 200,000 tweets with the hashtag ""#CancelNetflix"" became the top trending topic one day later. A first wave of criticism, in August, led Netflix to withdraw ""inappropriate"" artwork used to promote the film, which was released in theaters that month in France. Netflix also said it apologised for having used ""inappropriate"" images. But on Thursday, broader opposition to some of the imagery came from around the political spectrum in the United States. DeAnna Lorraine, a former Republican candidate for Congress from California, tweeted that ""Child pornography is illegal in America."" ""As the mother of an 8-year old girl, I STRONGLY support #CancelNetflix,"" added Beatrice Cardenas, another California Republican. The film, which received a director's award at the prestigious Sundance Film Festival, tells the story of Amy, an 11-year-old Parisian, who must juggle the strict rules of her Senegalese family and social media's emphasis on appearance. She joins a dance group formed by three other girls from her neighborhood, whose choreographies are sometimes suggestive. ""The hypersexualization of girls (and boys) is disgusting,"" tweeted Omar Navarro, another Republican politician. ""It is morally and ethically reprehensible. Pedophiles, child rapists and perverts would have a great time with #Cuties."" Contacted by AFP, Netflix did not immediately comment. Among the voices praising the movie were American actress Tessa Thompson (""Creed"", ""Avengers: Endgame""), who found it ""beautiful."" ""It gutted me at @sundancefest,"" she went on. ""It introduces a fresh voice at the helm. She's a French Senegalese Black woman mining her experiences. ""The film comments on the hyper-sexualization of preadolescent girls. Disappointed to see the current discourse. Disappointed to see how it was positioned in terms of marketing. ""I understand the response of everybody. But it doesn’t speak to the film I saw.""",OVAC

The move aims to turn youths susceptible to online abuse into agents promoting digital literacy among friends. The platform was introduced yesterday by Nuttapon Nimmanphatcharin, president of Depa; Thanakorn Srisuksai, manager of the Thai Media Fund; Marcus Adaktusson, chief corporate affairs officer of DTAC; and Srida Tanta-atipanit, manager of the Internet Foundation for the Development of Thailand. ""One in three kids in Thailand have faced cyberbullying according to a recent survey of 15,348 respondents aged 6-18,"" said Ms Srida. She said 25% of respondents engaged in online meetings and they faced fraud, attempts to lure them into illicit gangs, stalking as well as sexual harassment. The survey found 73% view pornographic content, nearly 50% see child pornography and 5.5% own child pornography, while 12.1% see gambling advertising and 2.8% gamble online. Mr Nuttapon said children own digital devices quite early in Thailand, which is among the top five countries in Asia-Pacific for youth ownership, but they lack sufficient digital literacy. Thai youngsters spend 5-10 hours a day online. He said Thailand needs to fill 40,000 digital skill positions per year, but only 20,000 graduates are able to fill them and 13,000 of them are likely to work in corporations. Referring to children's digital literacy, he said it is important to equip children with this skill to protect them against online abuse. ""Proactive new skill sets are needed as Thailand gears up for digital transformation, particularly in the real sectors,"" said Mr Nuttapon. Mr Adaktusson said young people need to have digital resilience and literacy in order to leverage digital tools for national and social development. ""Youth are on a rapid digital transformation journey that has challenges and opportunities. The Covid-19 outbreak has changed the learning and teaching landscape, with online classes becoming much more common,"" he said. Children can learn about digital literacy via https://learn.safeinternet.camp. The website has topics such as online privacy and sexual abuse, ways to stop cyberbullying and identifying fake news.

											Russia convicts Gulag historian on sex charge despite outcry
										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/1955819/russia-convicts-gulag-historian-on-sex-charge-despite-outcry,"PETROZAVODSK (RUSSIA) - A Russian court on Wednesday convicted a respected Gulag historian in a controversial sexual abuse case, but handed down a sentence that will see him free in the autumn. Yury Dmitriyev, the local head of prominent rights group Memorial in Karelia in northwestern Russia, was facing up to 15 years in a penal camp under the charges. His supporters insisted he is being punished for his work digging into Soviet-era abuses. After a trial held behind closed doors, a judge in the city of Petrozavodsk found Dmitriyev guilty of sexually abusing his adopted daughter, sentencing him to three-and-a-half years in prison. His lawyer Viktor Anufriyev told reporters that with time served in pre-trial detention Dmitriyev, 64, would be free in three-and-a-half months. Anufriyev said his client was content with the verdict because ""he knows he is not guilty"".  ""Such a verdict following such serious charges can mean only one thing: the prosecution has no real proof of Dmitriyev's guilt,"" Memorial said in a statement after the decision. ""Nevertheless, these charges have already robbed Yury Dmitriyev of more than three years of freedom and ruined his adopted daughter's life,"" it said. - Decades of research on Gulag - Dmitriyev spent decades locating and exhuming mass graves of people killed under Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin's rule, including in the notorious Gulag network of forced labour camps.  The researcher was first arrested in late 2016 on child pornography charges, and then acquitted in 2018. He was then arrested again on the sexual assault case, charges he has always denied. Memorial argues his prosecution is part of a growing crackdown on dissenters in Russia, and that he was targeted for calling attention to one of the darkest chapters in Russia's history. Dozens of his supporters gathered outside the courtroom on Wednesday and some said the verdict was as close as Dmitriyev could get to an acquittal. Yan Rachinsky, a director at Memorial, said the verdict allowed Russian authorities to save face after a robust public campaign in Dmitriyev's defence. ""On the other hand, it won't see a man die in prison,"" he said.  Fellow historian Anatoly Razumov said the fact that Dmitriyev ""will soon get back to his work is a victory"".  - 'Always grateful'-  Dmitriyev is known for helping open the Sandarmokh memorial in a pine forest in Karelia in memory of thousands of victims -- including many foreigners -- murdered in 1937 and 1938. ""Thanks to Yury Dmitriyev, I know where my grandfather was buried,"" supporter Galina Ivanova said outside the courthouse. ""And this is a huge deal, I will always be grateful to him."" The historian was initially arrested in late 2016 on child pornography charges and spent more than a year in pre-trial detention, before calls by prominent figures resulted in his release. He was acquitted in April 2018. But in a stunning turnabout, he was detained again on assault charges later that year after a higher court overturned the not guilty verdict. Dmitriyev's previous case centred on naked photographs of his then pre-teen adopted daughter seized during a search of his home. Independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta reported that Dmitriyev's cellmates had tried to pressure him into admitting his guilt or face sexual abuse in prison. Speaking in court during his second trial this month, Dmitriyev, who was himself adopted, said he had done everything to raise his daughter to be happy and healthy. In the speech published by the Meduza news portal, he also said it was important for people to remember their past. ""The strength of the state is not in its tanks and guns, in its nuclear rockets or an ability to tell everyone to flip off,"" he said.  ""No, the strength of the state is in its people.""",OVAC

											Germany's 'Black Forest Rambo' nabbed after six-day manhunt										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/1953500/germanys-black-forest-rambo-nabbed-after-six-day-manhunt,"BERLIN - After a huge six-day manhunt, German police said Friday they have caught the ""Black Forest Rambo"", a heavily armed suspect accused of stealing officers' weapons and going on the run in the woods. Yves Rausch, 31, was found sitting in a bush after a tip-off from two witnesses, ""with four guns visible in front of him"", said Juergen Rieger, the head of the search operation. The suspect also had an axe in his lap and one further gun, and there was a letter in front of him, Rieger said. Rausch was slightly injured in the arrest, as was a member of the special forces who was cut with the axe. ""I am relieved, happy and grateful that this exceptional situation for our town has come to an end,"" Uwe Gaiser, the mayor of the village of Oppenau, told reporters. Rausch had fled into the forest on Sunday after he managed to disarm four police officers, sparking a huge search operation. More than 2,500 officers combed the area with the help of special forces, helicopters, sniffer dogs and thermal imaging cameras for the fugitive, nicknamed ""Black Forest Rambo"" by the German press after pictures emerged of him dressed in combat gear. - 'Weapons freak' - The drama began on Sunday morning when police were informed that a suspicious man was hanging around a hut in the forest near Oppenau. Four officers sent to the scene said he cooperated at first when approached. But then he ""suddenly and completely unexpectedly"" threatened them with a gun and made them put down their own weapons before running away with them. Police had earlier warned that he may also be carrying a bow and arrow.  Oppenau prosecutor Herwig Schaefer described Rausch on Tuesday as a ""weapons freak"" with a ""great affinity for arms"". He has a long criminal record, including charges related to the possession of illegal weapons, theft and bodily injury. He received a juvenile sentence of 3.5 years in 2010 after he shot an acquaintance with a crossbow, seriously injuring her. Police found child pornography on his mobile phone while investigating him for the possession of explosives in 2019. Schools, kindergartens and the local swimming pool were closed on Monday as a precaution. - Swastikas and SS symbols - Investigators initially said they did not suspect any far-right or other political motive for Rausch's behaviour. However, they later revealed he had received an eight-month suspended sentence for incitement to hatred when he was 15 for altering the letters on a sign for a youth organisation so that it read ""Juden weg"" (""Jews be gone""). They also said he had made a fake bomb and was known for anti-Semitic statements as well as the use of swastikas and SS symbols.  Rausch had been homeless since autumn last year and had been squatting in the hut where he was spotted on Sunday. According to a former neighbour who described him as ""not an easy person"", he Rausch did odd jobs as a rail worker and a golf course caretaker, the Bild tabloid reported. Various weapons and petrol canisters were found in his apartment after he was evicted, as well as a small shooting range in the attic, according to Bild. He then reportedly lived in his car by the local swimming pool for a while before moving into the hut at the edge of the forest. Rausch will be examined by a psychiatrist due to the ""gravity of the crime"" and his past history, Schaefer said. In addition, a blood sample will be taken to check whether he was under the influence of drugs or other substances.",OVAC

Rivera's body was retrieved and an initial examination found no evidence of foul play or suicide, Ventura County Sheriff Bill Ayub told a press conference. ""We are confident the body we found is that of Naya Rivera,"" said Ayub, pointing to the location, appearance, clothing and condition of the body. Her body was being taken to a medical examiner's office for a full autopsy and confirmation of her identity from dental records, though no other missing persons have been reported at Lake Piru, he added. Rivera, 33, is believed to have accidentally drowned after renting the boat with her young son at the camping and recreational hotspot around an hour's drive northwest of Los Angeles. She had vanished on Wednesday afternoon and a massive search involving divers, patrol boats and helicopters was launched shortly after her sleeping son was spotted drifting alone in a boat on the lake. The son later told investigators that Rivera had helped him into the boat before ""he looked back and saw her disappear under the surface of the water"", said the sheriff. Ayub pointed to the lake's strong currents as a possible cause of a fatal accident. ""The idea perhaps being that the boat started drifting -- it was unanchored -- and that she mustered enough energy to get her son back onto the boat, but not enough to save herself,"" he said. The lake has been closed since Wednesday when around 100 personnel, including the US Coast Guard and rescuers from neighbouring counties, joined the search. Search teams used footage from video messaging calls Rivera made from the boat before her disappearance as well as interviews with her son to scour portions of the lake bed for her remains over six days with no success. ""We believe she was concealed within some of the shrubberies on the floor bed of the lake"" before eventually floating to the surface  due to natural decomposition, said Ayub. With less than 30cm of visibility underwater in daylight, the recovery operation was a ""complex search effort"" even with the use of sonar equipment, he said. Rivera was best known for her role as high school cheerleader Santana Lopez in Glee. She starred for six seasons in the wildly popular musical television series set in a US high school that ended in 2015. The Glee cast has been struck by tragedy before. Actor Mark Salling took his own life in 2018, weeks before being sentenced for possession of child pornography.

Ressa, 56, and her news site Rappler have been the target of legal action and probes after publishing stories critical of Duterte's policies, including his drug war that has killed thousands. She was allowed to remain free on bail after the ruling pending a possible appeal of the conviction, which carries a jail sentence of up to six years. ""We are going to stand up against any kind of attacks against press freedom,"" Ressa told journalists after the conviction in Manila. Monday's verdict decided a trial that stemmed from a businessman's 2017 complaint over a Rappler story five years earlier about his alleged ties to a then-judge on the nation's top court. Ressa, who Time magazine named as a Person of the Year in 2018, did not write the article and government investigators initially dismissed the businessman's allegation. But state prosecutors later filed charges against her and Reynaldo Santos, the former Rappler journalist who wrote it, under a controversial cyber crime statute aimed at online offences such as stalking and child pornography. The law they are accused of violating took effect in September 2012, months after the article was published. But prosecutors say Rappler's typographical correction to the story in 2014 to change ""evation"" to ""evasion"" was a substantial modification and the article was thus covered by the law. ""I've been the cautionary tale: be quiet or you're next... that's part of the reason why I have been targeted,"" Ressa, a co-founder of Rappler and a former CNN journalist, told AFP in an exclusive interview last week. Duterte's government has said the case is not politically motivated and that authorities must enforce the law, even against journalists.  

 - 'Fake news outlet' - But rights groups and press advocates say the libel charge along with a series of tax cases against Rappler and a government move to strip the news site of its licence amount to state harassment. Amnesty International said the ""attacks"" against Rappler were part of a wider government crackdown on media freedom in the Philippines. Ressa's verdict comes just over a month after government regulators forced off the air ABS-CBN, the nation's top broadcaster, following years of threats by Duterte to shut down the network. Both Rappler and ABS-CBN have reported extensively on Duterte's anti-drugs campaign in which police have gunned down alleged dealers and users in operations condemned by rights groups. Some of the crackdown's highest-profile critics have wound up behind bars, including Senator Leila de Lima, who is serving three years in jail on drug charges she insists were fabricated to silence her. In 2018, Duterte denounced Rappler as a ""fake news outlet"" and subsequently banned Ressa and her colleagues from his public engagements.

But state prosecutors later revived the case using a controversial cyber crime statute aimed at online offences ranging from stalking to child pornography. Authorities say they have not targeted Ressa for her work and are simply enforcing the law. But press and media watchdogs say the case against Ressa is in retaliation for Rappler's independent reporting on President Rodrigo Duterte and his administration. The website's journalists have cast a harsh light on Duterte's anti-drugs crackdown, which has killed thousands and drawn international censure despite being backed by many Filipinos. Another one of the most prominent critics of Duterte's narco war, Senator Leila de Lima, has been in jail for three years over drug allegations that she says are trumped up. Ressa's libel case is among a string of criminal charges that have hit her and Rappler since last year, many of which stem from allegations over how the site raised investment money. The multiple moves against Rappler have drawn international concern and made Ressa a cause celebre globally for people standing up against authoritarian governments. Time magazine named Ressa a Person of the Year in 2018. Rights watchdogs say the Duterte government has in recent weeks stepped up its campaign to silence dissent in other ways, with the nation's top broadcaster -- ABS-CBN -- shutdown. Lawmkers also this month passed the Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020, which allows warrantless arrests, weeks of detention without charge and other measures that critics fear could be used to crack down on peaceful government opponents. Ressa said Duterte had cemented himself as the most powerful Filipino leader since dictator Ferdinand Marcos, whose two decades in power ended in a famous ""people power"" uprising in 1986. ""We could even say more powerful than Marcos because he (Duterte) was able to declare martial law without even declaring martial law,"" Ressa said, referring to the Anti-Terrorism Act. Ressa, who served as CNN's bureau chief in Manila and Jakarta during a nearly 35-year career, said waiting for Monday's verdict was proving an emotional challenge. ""I am going to embrace my fear. I have to be ready and that starts in my head. That starts with my ability to be okay with the worst-case scenario,"" she said from her Manila home. ""I don't want to be surprised."" The independence of the judicial system in the Philippines, which has long had a reputation for corruption, has been further eroded during Duterte's four years in power, according to rights groups. But Ressa said individual people who make up the court system and their desire ""to be guided by the spirit of the law"" still give her reason for optimism. Regardless of the pressure from the highest levels of power to convict, it is up to the judge to make the final decision. ""I'm hoping. All I can do is hope,"" Ressa said.

											Saudi attacker on US base had longstanding al-Qaeda ties: US										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/1920248/saudi-attacker-on-us-base-had-longstanding-al-qaeda-ties-us,"WASHINGTON - The Saudi military student who killed three Americans at a US naval base in December had longstanding ties to Al-Qaeda and planned an attack before he arrived in the United States, US justice officials said Monday. The December 6 attack by Mohammed Alshamrani, a Royal Saudi Air Force flight student at the Naval Air Station Pensacola in Florida, ""was actually the culmination of years of planning and preparation,"" said FBI Director Christopher Wray. Evidence discovered on an encrypted cell phone shows he was radicalized at least as far back as 2015, and has since been associating with ""dangerous"" operatives from the Yemen-based Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), Wray added. The FBI and Justice Department revealed their findings after a months-long effort to crack the encryption on Alsahamrani's iPhones, which they said Apple refused to help with. US Attorney General Bill Barr accused Apple of putting its own financial interests ahead of the nation's. ""If not for our FBI's ingenuity, some luck, and hours upon hours of time and resources, this information would have remained undiscovered,"" Barr said. ""The bottom line: our national security cannot remain in the hands of big corporations who put dollars over lawful access and public safety. The time has come for a legislative solution,"" he said. - Discussed plans and tactics - Wray said the 21-year-old Saudi had expressed a desire to learn to fly years ago with plans for a ""special operation,"" enlisting in the Royal Saudi Air Force and joining flight training in the United States. ""In the months before the attack, while he was here among us, he talked with AQAP about his plans and tactics -- taking advantage of the information he acquired here, to assess how many people he could try to kill,"" Wray said. The December 6 shooting in a classroom building at the naval base left three US sailors dead and wounded eight other people, including two responding sheriff's deputies, before Alshamrani was killed by police. AQAP claimed responsibility, but there was no immediate evidence of a direct link. The incident forced the temporary freeze of all US training for foreign military officials to review security precautions. The decades-old US-Saudi training program has been crucial to the close relationship, with thousands of Saudis undergoing military training in the United States. The US expelled 21 of Alshamrani's classmates for reasons including that some had allegedly been aware of his radical leanings and others possessed jihadist material and child pornography. The program has since resumed, but with heavier vetting of Saudi students, and a ban on them accessing firearms. - Continuing Qaeda threat - The December attack indicated that, far from being eliminated with the killing of founder Osama Bin Laden in 2011, Al-Qaeda remains a potent threat, able to project its threat beyond the Middle East, according to experts. If directed by AQAP, Alshamrani's attack would be the first successful Al-Qaeda-organized assault on the United States since the September 11, 2001 attacks, said David Sterman, a senior policy analyst at the New America think tank. All the successful attacks in the country since then have been organized locally by people inspired or encouraged by al-Qaeda and the Islamic State group, but not organized by them. ""Is this the sign of an existing external plotting capability in Yemen that continues?"" Sterman asked. Even so, he noted: ""One deadly foreign-directed attack in 19 years is a relatively high level of success for the US.""",OVAC

The student initially paid, but he could no longer do so after spending 19,000 baht to prevent Natthawut from publishing the photos. The victim then filed the complaint with police, which led to Mr Natthawut’s arrest. The authorities raided Mr Natthawut’s home in the province and found the student’s photos on a computer and mobile phones. Mr Natthawut reportedly confessed, saying he committed the crime for the money. In addition, ATPD and TICAC law enforcement agents arrested Piyawat Benjawan, 40, for allegedly possessing child porn in his possession. Pol Maj Gen Weerachon Boonthawee, investigation chief of provincial police bureau 5, said the TICAC was informed by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation that an individual in Thailand had downloaded large quantities of pornography involving minors. Police nabbed Mr Piyawat at his home in Chiang Mai. Mr Piyawat reportedly confessed he downloaded pictures of underage girls because he was bored while under self-isolation. Pol Maj Gen Weerachon noted that it is illegal to download nude photos of individuals under the age of 18.",OVAC

											Facebook Cancels Gatherings With 50 or More People Through June 2021										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/1902270/facebook-cancels-gatherings-with-50-or-more-people-through-june-2021,"Facebook Inc. is canceling all gatherings with 50 or more people through June 2021, Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said Thursday in a post outlining a cautious return for the social media giant from the coronavirus disruption. Mr. Zuckerberg, writing on his personal Facebook page, said the majority of his employees will continue working from home through at least the end of May, with some exceptions possible for employees whose jobs make it difficult to work remotely, such as engineers working on complex hardware and some content reviewers. He said that employees who feel the need will be allowed to work from home through at least the summer. Mr. Zuckerberg's remarks present a very measured reemergence by one of the world's most influential companies when many businesses and government leaders are deliberating over the exit path from the coronavirus shutdown. The CEO said Facebook was slowing its plans to return to the office and ""overall, we don't expect to have everyone back in our offices for some time."" ""We know that most people can't work from home as easily as many of our employees can,"" Mr. Zuckerberg wrote. ""We also know that when society does eventually start re-opening, it will have to open slowly in staggered waves to make sure that the people who are returning to work can do so safely and that we minimize the possibility of future outbreaks."" Major technology companies were some of the first in the nation to have their employees work from home and cancel large in-person events. Facebook in March recommended employees stay home when feasible but blocks of its staff remained at the office for work deemed too sensitive to perform remotely, such as reviewing videos or images related to child abuse or pornography. Conferences planned by Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc.'s Google and others have largely been postponed or canceled due to the virus outbreak. Apple Inc. shut all its stores outside China in mid-March. Facebook, which earlier this year canceled the in-person part of its F8 developers conference for May, guaranteed that such gatherings at the company won't take place until more than a year later. Facebook employs roughly 45,000 people, most based at its headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. The company also uses more than 15,000 contractors to help it police its platform. California residents have been under a statewide stay-at-home order since March 19. Gov. Gavin Newsom this week said there was no specific timeline for loosening the measures. In his post Thursday, Mr. Zuckerberg acknowledged that Facebook is in a position to continue having most of its employees stay at home. Much of the company's workforce can do their jobs behind a computer screen, and Facebook has the infrastructure and capacity to operate remotely. As a pioneer of online communication and virtual gatherings, it is suited for working in the pandemic. Mr. Zuckerberg said Facebook has also extended a ban on business travel through at least June. He wrote that in lieu of large, in-person gatherings the company will hold some events virtually. ""I hope this helps contain the spread of Covid-19 so we can keep our communities safe and get back up and running again soon,"" he said.",OVAC

Speaking at the ""Protecting Children from Online Sexual Exploitation"" seminar held by Thai Media Fund, Pol Capt Khemachart Prakaihongmanee, deputy director of the Bureau of Foreign Affairs and Transnational Crime at the Department of Special Investigation, said Thailand was experiencing a surge in paedophile activity, with predators orchestrating and watching abuse on live-streaming sites and via webcams, and paying for it with near-untraceable cryptocurrency. ""Paedophiles can now use an array of mobile and online tools -- including social networks, video-sharing sites and the dark web -- to direct and watch child rape and sexual abuse anonymously,"" he said.

According to data from the Digital Economy and Society Ministry, about 70% of the Thai population either owns or has access to a smartphone, while an estimated 67% of Thais also have access to the internet. A study in 2018 showed that Thais aged between eight and 12 spend up to 35 hours per week on the net, which is three hours more than the global average, and that 60% of them are at risk of being exploited via online platforms. Pol Capt Khemachart said that though many websites with child abuse content have been tracked down by Thai authorities and foreign agencies, he believes there is still a ""phenomenal"" number of sites run by paedophiles on the so-called dark net. The dark net has networks that can only be accessed using specific software that re-routes connections through several servers, allowing users to remain anonymous. Websites on the dark net are not indexed, which means they do not appear when looked for with a search engine like Google.

Pol Col Khemachart said in order to combat this issue, Thailand will have to improve its national database -- a vital tool for finding and identifying both victims and perpetrators -- as well as invest more to boost the capacity of law enforcers and police officers. He said Thailand should also consider recruiting more women to the police force. Pol Col Sarawut Khonyai, deputy commissioner of the Provincial Police Region 6, said that while the internet offers a seemingly unlimited supply of potential victims, it also provides paedophiles a way of making money through the sale of sexually explicit photos and videos.

""There are so many significant and special moments that take place over WhatsApp and we are humbled and honored to reach this milestone."" The statement said WhatsApp remained committed to its ""strong encryption"" that enables users to connect privately even amid calls by law enforcement in the United States and elsewhere to provide more access. ""Strong encryption is a necessity in modern life. We will not compromise on security because that would make people less safe,"" WhatsApp said. ""For even more protection, we work with top security experts, employ industry leading technology to stop misuse as well as provide controls and ways to report issues -- without sacrificing privacy."" Last week, child protection organizations called on Facebook to halt plans for strong encryption of all its platforms, saying that would allow predators to operate freely. WhatsApp employs ""end to end encryption"" which can in many cases prevent law enforcement from accessing user data even with a court order. The social network is working to extend end-to-end encryption across its messaging applications, including Facebook Messenger and Instagram. Back door dilemma Child protection groups have expressed fears that stronger encryption of online exchanges would facilitate the sharing of child pornography. Backers of strong encryption argue that any special access or ""backdoors"" allowed for law enforcement would weaken security and could be exploited by criminals, hackers and authoritarian governments. Officials from the US, Britain and Australia late last year called on Facebook to allow authorities to circumvent encryption to better fight extremism, child pornography and other crimes. The heads of Facebook's WhatsApp and Messenger, Will Cathcart and Stan Chudnovsky, responded in a letter to officials from the three countries that allowing this kind of ""backdoor"" access ""would be a gift to criminals, hackers and repressive regimes"" while leaving users vulnerable. Facebook's stance on encryption has been backed by more than 100 activist organizations, security experts and industry groups who warned against efforts to force tech companies to weaken encryption. Despite its strong encryption, WhatsApp has seen flaws exploited in cyberspace. Human rights activists have said that spyware hidden in WhatsApp messages, possible developed by Israel-based NSO Group, was used to track dissidents and others. Amazon chief Jeff Bezos's phone is also believed to have been infected by spyware hidden in a WhatsApp message from Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman. WhatsApp in October sued NSO Group, accusing it of using the messaging service to conduct cyberespionage on journalists, human rights activists and others. Breakup? WhatsApp is one member of the Facebook app ""family"" that includes its core social network, Instagram and Messenger. Facebook said recently some 2.89 billion people globally are daily users of at least one of these services. But the growth has also attracted attention of regulators and activists concerned over the dominance of major tech platforms.

Police apprehended Suchart Charoenphol, 37, in front of a school in Muang district of Suphan Buri on Thursday night. He was wanted on an arrest warrant issued by the Suphan Buri Provincial Court on charges of sexually molesting a 16-year-old girl and human trafficking by producing or distributing child pornography for sexual exploitation. The arrest followed a tip-off that porn videos and other material had been put on sale on social media by Facebook user “Lerk Khui Thang Amphor’’ via his Facebook messenger, Pol Col Apisant Chairat, a superintendent of the Anti-Human Trafficking Suppression Division, said on Friday. Anti-human trafficking police investigated and later an undercover officer posing as a customer ordered a video from the Facebook user, who  gave a bank account in the name “Suchart Charoenphol’’ for  payment.

											Encryption battle reignited as US govt at loggerheads with Apple										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/1836179/encryption-battle-reignited-as-us-govt-at-loggerheads-with-apple,"WASHINGTON - Apple and the US government are at loggerheads for the second time in four years over unlocking iPhones connected to a mass shooting, reviving debate over law enforcement access to encrypted devices. Attorney General Bill Barr said Monday that Apple failed to provide ""substantive assistance"" in unlocking two iPhones in the investigation into the December shooting deaths of three US sailors at a Florida naval station, which he called an ""act of terrorism."" Apple disputed Barr's claim, while arguing against the idea of ""backdoors"" for law enforcement to access its encrypted smartphones. ""We reject the characterization that Apple has not provided substantive assistance in the Pensacola investigation,"" the company said in a statement. ""Our responses to their many requests since the attack have been timely, thorough and are ongoing."" Late on Tuesday, President Donald Trump weighed in on Twitter, saying the government was helping Apple on trade issues ""yet they refuse to unlock phones used by killers, drug dealers and other violent criminal elements."" ""They will have to step up to the plate and help our great Country, NOW!"" he added. The standoff highlighted the debate between law enforcement and the tech sector about encryption -- a key way to protect the privacy of digital communications, but which can also make investigations difficult, even with a court order. The latest battle is similar to the dispute between Apple and the US Justice Department after the December 2015 mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, when the iPhone maker rejected a request to develop software to break into the shooter's iPhone. That fight ended in 2016 when the government paid an outside party a reported $1 million for a tool that circumvented Apple's iPhone encryption. Barr last year called on Facebook to allow authorities to circumvent encryption to fight extremism, child pornography and other crimes. The social network has said it would move ahead with strong encryption for its messaging applications. - Opening wrong doors? Digital rights activists argue that any privileged access for law enforcement would weaken security and make it easier for hackers and authoritarian governments to intercept messages. ""We have always maintained there is no such thing as a backdoor just for the good guys,"" Apple's statement said. ""Backdoors can also be exploited by those who threaten our national security and the data security of our customers."" Apple and others argue that digital ""breadcrumbs"" make it increasingly easy to track people, even without breaking into personal devices. The government's latest demand ""is dangerous and unconstitutional, and would weaken the security of millions of iPhones,"" Jennifer Granick of the American Civil Liberties Union said in a statement. ""Strong encryption enables religious minorities facing genocide, like the Uighurs in China, and journalists investigating powerful drug cartels in Mexico, to communicate safely."" Granick added that Apple cannot allow the FBI access to encrypted communications ""without also providing it to authoritarian foreign governments and weakening our defenses against criminals and hackers."" Kurt Opsahl of the Electronic Frontier Foundation echoed that sentiment, saying Apple ""is right to provide strong security"" for its devices. ""The AG (attorney general) requesting Apple re-engineer its phones to break that security is a poor security trade-off, and imperils millions of innocent people around the globe,"" Opsahl tweeted. James Lewis of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank, said he believes it's possible to allow law enforcement access without sacrificing encryption. ""You're not weakening encryption, you're making it so it's not end-to-end,"" Lewis told AFP. ""It means that there's a third party who can look at it under appropriate authority."" But Lewis said he does not expect either side to come out a winner in the battle, and that US officials will likely find another outside party to crack the two iPhones belonging to the shooter, Royal Saudi Air Force 2nd Lieutenant Mohammed Saeed Alshamran, who died in the attack. ""It's a repeat of the movie we saw in San Bernardino,"" he said. ""It's going to be harder because Apple probably fixed the trick that worked in San Bernardino.""",OVAC
81,81,2020-01-10 04:01:00,It's always funny until someone gets hurt,https://www.bangkokpost.com/life/social-and-lifestyle/1832449/its-always-funny-until-someone-gets-hurt,"The seriousness of bullying among schoolchildren was brought into sharp focus recently, after a 13-year-old boy shot his classmate, killing him at their school. The young shooter claimed that this was in retribution for the bullying he had suffered at the hands of his dead classmate, who used to hit him, call him gay and otherwise shame him in front of others. In another incident, an 11-year-old girl tried to commit suicide by hanging herself in the school toilet. Her father reported that she had been bullied and teased, sometimes violently, for being poor and having dark skin. Many people still try to pass off bullying among the young, whether it be teasing or fighting, as simply child's play. But, as can be seen from these two incidents which happened just last month, bullying can lead to devastating outcomes, especially when the problem is allowed to escalate without proper intervention from adults. According to statistics, about one-third of children suffer from bullying, says adolescent medicine specialist Dr Jiraporn Arunakul from Ramathibodi Hospital. ""Many children feel they have no way out, and the adults in their lives can sometimes be unreliable. When adult assistance and intervention is ineffective, some [in extreme circumstances] run away from home. Some fight back, even using weapons. Some choose to put up with it. But bullying doesn't just affect the victims, it also affects the bullies themselves,"" said Dr Jiraporn. One in eight bullies grow up to become criminals in adulthood, she explained. A child may be bullied for many reasons: physical appearance, family background, gender identity and expression, and others. But what makes a child start bullying another? There are actually a number of potential contributing factors. ""Some children enjoy bullying. They will have seen adults playing pranks or teasing children, then laughing, and think it's a fun thing that they can do too,"" explained Dr Jiraporn. ""Some lack empathy and understanding of things like diversity. Society teaches them strict standards they have to adhere to. Girls have to be white and pretty, for example, and if anyone strays from these standards, then children may see them as abnormal, and start teasing them as a result."" Some kids may feel powerless and oppressed at home and so decide to exercise their power at school. They bully others to feel better about themselves. For others, bullying may stem from personal or mental shortcomings, such as a short attention span, impaired social skills or lack of self control. They don't know how to play or socialise with others, and compensate by teasing or playing pranks. When faced with school bullying, teachers and parents tend to respond with a punishment. Dr Jiraporn says this is generally ineffective. Punishment may scare the bully into ceasing their actions temporarily, but most will soon revert to bullying, some to a worse degree than before. This can then result in the victims being so intimidated that they stop telling others about the bullying for fear of making things worse for themselves. ""In that situation, teachers think the problem is solved. But in reality, the kids just don't dare to speak up anymore,"" she said. So, it's not only victims that need help, but also bullies. To really get them to change their behaviour, it is crucial to find what is causing it in the first place. First and foremost, this needs to start at home. Children must be taught to have empathy and respect for diversity and the rights of others. ""Bullying is a violation of people's rights,"" Dr Jiraporn stressed. ""We need to teach children that if they bully a classmate, even though they might enjoy it, the other person doesn't, and it is a violation."" Parents have to set examples and not be bullies themselves. ""Some parents call their kids names like 'fatty', for example. The children would then come to see this as normal."" With schools being places where children spend a major part of their day and also where bullying usually takes place, they must play a leading role. Ideally, schools need to have a clear policy that they won't tolerate any form of bullying, with proper rules and guidelines in place to systematically help troubled children. Students that bully others need to be assessed to find out why they behave in this way. A system should also be implemented where victims or witnesses of bullying can safely report incidents to teachers. Some schools in Thailand have already implemented some of these measures. One is Wat Preng School, a state-run primary school with around 400 students in Samut Prakan. Nakarin Aeknigron, a teacher from the school's student welfare department, said that bullying does occur within the school grounds, but this is mostly teasing and calling others names -- nothing too serious, though there are ""a lot of small cases"" to solve. When incidents take place, student welfare and homeroom teachers step in. ""We don't punish them, but rather reason with them and explain that their actions upset others. Then we get them to apologise,"" said Nakarin. ""Should things get out of hand, we take it to the school director and invite the parents to come to the school to inform them and try to work out a solution together."" The students are generally empathetic, he said, and this can be fostered. There are ""third gender"" students, as well as students with autism and Down's syndrome, all studying together in the school. Students are encouraging and understanding of their peers. LGBTI students are accepted. Since the shooting and suicide attempt made headlines, Nakain said the school director Prawatpong Rodklang had a talk with the entire school, encouraging students to play nicely with one another, teachers to educate them how and parents to increase supervision at home. However, looking out for students today shouldn't stop at the playground or classroom, Nakarin continued. Teacher supervision may now have to extend to social media, especially chat groups on applications like Facebook and Line. ""We may not allow children to bring their phones to school, but once they go home, they go online and converse in chat groups, where troubles sometimes manifest."" Some of the problems he has found include anything from fighting, using vulgar words, jealousy, sharing pornography and others. We need to remind ourselves we're talking about primary schoolchildren here. When such things happen, Nakarin says that well-meaning students usually inform him and invite him into the group, where he will then try to teach them how to use social media properly and prevent the problem from escalating. Dr Jiraporn approves, saying that friends and witnesses to bullying may be more important than some realise when it comes to dealing with these issues. They can step in to protect the victims and report to teachers. Ever since the aforementioned high-profile incidents took place, society has been pointing fingers at the usual scapegoats, such as video games and other media, for turning kids violent. ""Everything in a child's surroundings has an effect on them,"" Dr Jiraporn explained. ""This includes video games. There have been studies suggesting that games can influence a child's tendency to become violent. However, this doesn't mean all games affect everyone the same way."" In addition to games, violence on TV and in films may serve to normalise it in children's eyes. The last frontier is social media. ""Children today grow up in a society where people can freely make hurtful comments online. How can they not absorb that?"" Others blame it all on weapons. And while Dr Jiraporn refrained from commenting on whether it is too easy for people to access firearms, she did imply that they are not the cause of violence. ""It's rather straightforward. If adults have easy access to weapons, so will children,"" she said. The following are some suggestions by Dr Jiraporn for adults to help children cope with bullying: Listen to what children have to say and how they feel. Don't listen only to tell them what to do. Don't pass bullying off as a small issue or tell them to simply put up with it. Bullying shouldn't be tolerated. Always reassure them that they can rely on adults. Ask them how they think they should handle the problem and allow them, within reason, to try their solutions. Make them realise they have a choice. Let them try to solve it first. Take the necessary actions when children can no longer feel they can handle it.",OVAC

											Pope lifts 'pontifical secret' for sex abuse cases										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/1818279/pope-lifts-pontifical-secret-for-sex-abuse-cases,"VATICAN CITY: Priests can no longer cite papal secrecy in abuse cases, the Vatican said Tuesday, the latest move by Pope Francis to combat silence surrounding paedophilia in the Roman Catholic church. The Church has been rocked by thousands of reports of sexual abuse around the world by priests, and accusations of cover-ups by senior clergy. Francis' latest instructions regarding Vatican law on sexual abuse say that the pontifical secret no longer applies ""to accusations, trials and decisions"" involving such cases. Pontifical secrecy is a rule of confidentiality designed to protect sensitive information related to Church governance, such as diplomatic correspondence, personnel issues and alleged crimes. Critics say the secrecy laws have prevented priests and victims from reporting abuse, as well as hindered national justice systems prosecuting cases. The Vatican also announced on Tuesday that it was raising the age at which sexual images of a person were deemed child pornography from 14 to 18. In May, the pope passed a landmark measure to oblige those who know about sex abuse to report it to their superiors, a move expected to bring even more cases to light. In Tuesday's statement, issued on the Argentine pontiff's 83rd birthday, Francis spelt out the new obligations. ""The person who files the report, the person who alleges to have been harmed and the witnesses shall not be bound by any obligation of silence with regard to matters involving the case,"" he wrote. Archbishop of Malta Charles Scicluna, the Vatican's chief sex crime investigator, called Francis' move an ""epochal decision that removes obstacles and impediments."" He told the official Vatican News website that ""the question of transparency now is being implemented at the highest level."" The pope has vowed an ""all-out battle"" against sex abuse within the Church, but some victims' groups have said concrete measures have been slow in coming. Marie Collins, a child sexual abuse survivor who in 2017 resigned from a Vatican committee she said was failing to adequately tackle paedophilia, welcomed the pope's latest move. ""Excellent news,"" Collins wrote on Twitter, saying the committee had recommended the step. ""At last a real and positive change."" Despite the lifting of papal secrecy, Francis qualified that discretion in sexual abuse cases was still required. Information pertaining to such cases should be treated, ""in such a way as to ensure its security, integrity and discretion... for the sake of protecting the good name, image and privacy of all persons involved,"" the pope wrote. But that should not obstruct the law, the obligation to report abuses and the carrying out of requests by law enforcement, the instructions said.",OVAC

											Twitter backs overhaul of social media to stem disinformation										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/1814289/twitter-backs-overhaul-of-social-media-to-stem-disinformation,"SAN FRANCISCO - Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey is funding research aimed at changing the way information circulates on social media -- with the goal of combating online violence, hate and disinformation. Dorsey on Tuesday announced he would fund an independent team of five architects, engineers, and designers -- dubbed Bluesky -- to develop an ""open and decentralized standard for social media."" In a series of posts, he explained the goal is for Twitter to ultimately be subject to this new standard, which would be open to adoption by fellow social media networks like Facebook or TikTok. ""We're facing entirely new challenges centralized solutions are struggling to meet,"" Dorsey said.  Those range from rooting out disinformation and detecting violent content -- hate speech or child pornography -- to the fact today's algorithms tend to direct users' toward content ""that sparks controversy and outrage.""  ""Centralized enforcement of global policy to address abuse and misleading information is unlikely to scale over the long-term without placing far too much burden on people,"" Dorsey said. But he argues a single technical standard shared across different platforms -- which currently operate like walled gardens -- could be a game changer. A shared new standard could curb the power of tech giants to determine what content goes viral -- putting individual users in control. It could also theoretically hand users back control of their data -- currently stored and monetized by private platforms, typically through advertising. Dorsey argued that the value of social media was increasingly shifting away from content hosting and removal, and towards recommendation algorithms. ""Unfortunately, these algorithms are typically proprietary, and one can’t choose or build alternatives. Yet,"" he wrote. An open standard, Dorsey said, would allow Twitter to focus on building recommendation algorithms that ""promote healthy conversation."" He also said the team would also seek to ""build open community"" around the new standard, to include companies and organizations, researchers and civil society leaders. ""This isn't going to happen overnight,"" Dorsey conceded. ""It will take many years to develop a sound, scalable, and usable decentralized standard for social media that paves the path to solving the challenges listed above. Our commitment is to fund this work to that point and beyond.""",OVAC

											Facebook firm on message encryption despite pressure										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/1813409/facebook-firm-on-message-encryption-despite-pressure,"WASHINGTON: Facebook said Tuesday it plans to move ahead with strong encryption for all its messaging applications, claiming that allowing law enforcement special access would end up being ""a gift to criminals, hackers and repressive regimes."" The comments from the leading social network come weeks after officials from the US, Britain and Australia called on Facebook to allow authorities to circumvent encryption to better fight extremism, child pornography and other crimes. ""The 'backdoor' access you are demanding for law enforcement would be a gift to criminals, hackers and repressive regimes, creating a way for them to enter our systems and leaving every person on our platforms more vulnerable to real-life harm,"" the heads of Facebook's WhatsApp and Messenger, Will Cathcart and Stan Chudnovsky, said in a letter to officials from the three countries. Critics have argued that new forms of encryption -- which can make it impossible for anyone except the sender and recipient to see the contents of a message -- are locking out law enforcement. Facebook, which already uses ""end-to-end"" encryption on WhatsApp, said in the letter it intends to do the same across all its messaging services. Jay Sullivan, the privacy product chief for Messenger, told a congressional hearing Tuesday Facebook was aware of its duty to work with law enforcement, pointing to the tech giant's assistance in terrorism and child abuse cases. Earlier Tuesday, more than 100 activist organisations, security experts and industry groups warned against efforts to force tech companies to weaken encryption. ""These exceptional access mechanisms for law enforcement agencies would be the same 'back doors' that provide an opportunity for terrorists, criminals, and other parties to gain unauthorised access,"" said the letter endorsed by groups including the American Civil Liberties Union, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. ""Technologists cannot build systems that are inherently able to tell when 'bad' people use them, just as engineers cannot design sidewalks and highways to crumble underneath the feet of certain people."" It said special access demands would ""embolden repressive and authoritarian regimes in their attempts to pressure messaging apps and device manufacturers to build surveillance capabilities into their products and services.""  

 A joint letter in October signed by US Attorney General William Barr, British Home Secretary Priti Patel and Australian Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton urged Facebook to give authorities the ability to circumvent encryption used in its messaging services. The officials said strong encryption made it more difficult for law enforcement to detect terrorism and child pornography, and that a move to implement ""end-to-end"" encryption on its Messenger platform could make matters worse. ""Facebook has not committed to address our serious concerns about the impact its proposals could have on protecting our most vulnerable citizens,"" said the October letter. At a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing Tuesday, New York District Attorney Cyrus Vance echoed those concerns, and argued that investigations were being crippled by the failure to get access to encrypted messages and smartphones, which cannot be accessed even with a warrant. ""Unintended or not, the reality remains that these tech titans are doing tremendous damage to our justice system, particularly justice at the local and state levels, by choosing to render themselves incapable of complying with a judge’s signed order,"" Vance said.",OVAC

											Shooting stars: TikTok's explosive and rocky ride to fame										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/1804069/shooting-stars-tiktoks-explosive-and-rocky-ride-to-fame,"MUMBAI - He's no Bollywood star, but school dropout Israil Ansari has found fast fame on TikTok with two million followers glued to his oddball dancing and rainbow hairstyles in India, the app's biggest international market. Thanks to the addictive and controversial Chinese-made platform, the gangly 20-year-old can now barely walk down the street without teenagers flocking to him for autographs. ""I get extremely excited watching people react to my videos on TikTok,"" Ansari told AFP in Mumbai, saying he tries to produce clips that make people happy, ""be it with a peppy song or comedy videos"". ""In a land of 1.3 billion people, grabbing popularity is not easy."" Launched by Chinese company ByteDance in September 2017, TikTok's playfulness and off-the-cuff humour -- users post short clips of themselves performing skits, lip-syncing and dancing -- has turned out to be its trump card. Last week the app hit 1.5 billion downloads worldwide, outperforming Instagram, which is better known for polished selfies than goofy memes. Anyone armed with a smartphone -- whether a suburban US teen or an Indian slum-dweller -- can use TikTok to tell their own story in under 60 seconds, experts say, winning viewers, likes, shares and eventually, the elusive goal of stardom. ""TikTok videos work because they are raw, making them more relatable for youngsters, who love receiving feedback and sometimes earn money from the app, depending on their popularity,"" Meenakshi Tiwari, an analyst at the US firm Forrester Research, told AFP. A sophisticated AI system enables the app to detect its users' tastes and point them to videos that keep them hooked for hours on end. - Pornography and politics - ""India is the main market for TikTok followed by China, the United States, Indonesia, and Vietnam,"" Craig Chapple from San Francisco-based research agency Sensor Tower told AFP. The South Asian nation accounts for 40 percent of TikTok's 800 million users worldwide and 11 of the top 25 stars on the app are based in India. That includes Ansari, who earns commissions for partnering with brands to promote their products, earning anywhere between 20,000 rupees ($280) to 50,000 rupees in a month. In China, where the app is called Douyin, viewers can purchase everything from face cream to clothing by tapping on videos created by influencers. But it hasn't been all fun and games -- the app has come under fire around the world over claims that it was encouraging the spread of child pornography. Bangladesh has banned it as part of a clampdown on porn, while Indonesia briefly blocked access over blasphemy concerns. TikTok has also been hit with an enormous fine in the United States for illegally collecting information from children. The app is wildly popular among teenagers and two-thirds of all TikTok users are aged under 30, according to Sensor Tower. In India, the app has often run into controversy, hitting the headlines in April after a teenager was accidentally shot dead by his friend in Delhi as they filmed a video featuring a pistol. Days later, an Indian court momentarily cut access to TikTok over paedophilia concerns. - Privacy fears - In addition to fears that the app could be used to promote pornographic content, political sensitivities have also surfaced as a flashpoint. Its Chinese origins have sparked concerns about the app serving as a soft power arm of Beijing, with TikTok facing a national security investigation in the United States to probe whether it is sending data to China. In July, the app suspended the accounts of some of its biggest Indian stars after the four men -- all Muslims -- posted videos criticising the lynching of a Muslim youth by a Hindu mob. The restrictions were later lifted but many believed the app's creators had succumbed to pressure from Hindu nationalists after a right-wing lawmaker from a regional party filed a case against the four TikTok influencers. Despite the scandals, the appetite for TikTok shows no sign of easing. ""From morning to late in the night, I only watch TikTok videos,"" 22-year-old Azeez Ahmed Siddiqui told AFP. ""My family thrashes me for not having a job and wasting my time on TikTok. But I really want to become a star,"" he said. With 3,500 followers, the road to TikTok superstardom seems a difficult one but the Mumbai-based Siddique is unfazed. ""I know a lot of people who had no careers and now are famous because of TikTok. ""If they can achieve this, then why can't I?""",OVAC

											Pope Francis calls for action to safeguard women, children										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/1799069/pope-francis-calls-for-action-to-safeguard-women-children,"Pope Francis called for migrants to be made welcome and women and children to be protected from exploitation, abuse and enslavement as he began a busy two days of activities in Thailand on Thursday. Francis pleaded for action against one of the region's greatest scourges, human trafficking to fuel the forced labour and sex trade industries, as he began a weeklong visit to Asia. He praised the Thai government's efforts to fight human trafficking in a speech delivered at host Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha's Government House offices. But he appealed for greater international commitment to protect women and children ""who are violated and exposed to every form of exploitation, enslavement, violence and abuse''. He called for ways to ""uproot this evil and to provide ways to restore their dignity''. ""The future of our peoples is linked in large measure to the way we will ensure a dignified future to our children,'' he said. The United Nations considers Thailand a key trafficking destination as well as a source of forced labour and sex slaves, who are trafficked at home or abroad. The UN anti-trafficking agency says migrants come from Laos, Myanmar, Cambodia or Vietnam, with Cambodian women and children in particular trafficked to beg in Thai cities. The US State Department has faulted Thailand for failing to fully crack down on traffickers who induce young Thai girls into pornography, as well as the exploitation, including via debt bondage, of migrant workers in commercial fishing enterprises. The Thai government has insisted it has made significant progress in cracking down on human trafficking and has vowed continued cooperation with international bodies to improve. Francis has made the fight against human trafficking one of the cornerstones of his papacy, calling it a crime against humanity. Under his express wishes, the Vatican has hosted several conferences on eradicating trafficking, featuring women freed from forced prostitution. And during his papacy, an international network of religious sisters, Talitha Kum, has gained greater prominence following decades of quiet efforts to rescue women from traffickers. While Thailand has a tradition of taking in migrant labourers and sheltering people fleeing from danger in neighbouring countries, it also has a checkered history of deporting foreigners who are in the country illegally, even if they are recognised by the United Nations as refugees who are fleeing persecution. In addition, up until it signed an agreement with the UN refugee agency this year, Thailand held child asylum-seekers in detention centres. In his comments made alongside Thai officials, Francis thanked the country for its historical role welcoming migrants from across the region, who are drawn to Thailand for economic opportunities. But he said all countries must do more to resolve the conflicts that fuel the ""tragic exodus'' of forced migration. ""May every nation devise effective means for protecting the dignity and rights of migrants and refugees, who face dangers, uncertainties and exploitation in their quest for freedom and a decent life for their families,'' he said. Francis had a busy schedule on his first full day of activities of his weeklong tour, which will also take him to Japan. During a meeting with Thailand's Supreme Patriarch of Buddhism, Francis committed the Catholic Church to working more with Thailand's majority Buddhists to launch projects to care for the poor and the environment. Francis's visit was the second time a pope has called on the spiritual leader of Thailand's Buddhists, after St John Paul II in 1984. There are fewer than 400,000 Catholics among Thailand's 65 million people, yet Francis said they nevertheless have enjoyed freedom in their religious practice. He called for increasing charitable initiatives to improve fraternity and to help the poor ""and our much-abused common home.'' His visit to Wat Ratchabophit was followed by a visit to a Catholic hospital. He was to wrap up the day with a private audience with His Majesty the King and a public Mass at Bangkok's National Stadium. Friday's agenda is far more church-based, with meetings with local clergy, Asian bishops and, separately,  a meeting with leaders of different Christian denominations and other faiths.",OVAC

											Hun Sen's media witch-hunt must end										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/1791569/hun-sens-media-witch-hunt-must-end,"Almost two years after their arrest on outlandish charges of ""espionage"", two of Cambodia's finest journalists are snared by a government assault on free expression. At the heart of their legal woes is their past work for Radio Free Asia, a US-funded broadcaster that has long been a trusted source of independent news in the country. Yeang Sothearin and Uon Chhin spent nine months in pre-trial detention in Phnom Penh's squalid Prey Sar Prison after their Nov 14, 2017, arrest. They were then released on bail but their torment continues. They await the outcome of an unpredictable trial that could yet see them sentenced to 15 years. The verdict has already been postponed twice. Although the trial was said to have concluded in August, the presiding judge declared on Oct 3 the evidence was insufficient to rule the men guilty or innocent. But rather than acquit them, he ordered a ""re-investigation"", meaning Yeang Sothearin and Uon Chhin's ordeal at the hands of Cambodia's politicised court system continues to this day with no end in sight. International focus on Cambodia has been on Prime Minister Hun Sen's clash with the main political opposition party which was outlawed in 2017, making Cambodia a de facto one-party state. With opposition leaders and activists treated as national traitors and criminals, the democracy that was meant to rise from the ashes of civil war after the 1991 Paris Peace Agreements lies in ruins. The government's treatment of a free press has been just as egregious. In Cambodia, state prosecutors equate independent journalism with espionage. They charged both men with providing ""information that is destructive to national defence to a foreign state"", on the pretext that they continued to work in secret for Radio Free Asia after it was forced to shutter its Phnom Penh bureau in September 2017, two months before their arrest. In fact, their contract with RFA had expired that September. With no job and in need of income, Uon Chhin had opened a karaoke production studio, which the government claimed was a clandestine news bureau. For good measure, prosecutors later added a pornography charge against both men. The arbitrary nature of the legal process against them reflects deeper problems. Cambodia has dashed international hopes that it would reckon with its haunting past under the murderous Khmer Rouge rule of the late 1970s and embrace democracy with strong, credible civil society institutions. Instead, its judiciary is widely viewed as a tool of the government to crush dissent. Social activists and reporters, as well as opposition party members, have repeatedly fallen foul of a prejudicial legal system. In January, opposition activist Kong Mas was arrested for writing on Facebook that the European Union planned to impose tariffs on Cambodian rice, which proved correct. Kong Mas was later sentenced to 18 months on separate charges related to his political activism. Labour activist Rath Roth Mony was deported from Thailand and sentenced in June to two years for helping Russian state-owned TV network RT make a documentary about child prostitution in Cambodia. Then in July, Cambodian military police arrested journalists Hun Sokha and Keo Ratana for reporting protests against forced evictions in the southern city of Sihanoukville. They too, face serious charges under the country's criminal code. The prosecution of Uon Chhin, a cameraman, and Yeang Sothearin, an editor and anchor, has proceeded despite a dearth of evidence. It undermines the high-minded declaration of the Cambodian government in December that it ""cherishes"" a free press and that RFA would be welcome to re-open its in-country bureau. It has left both men and their family members in limbo. Yeang Sothearin's two young children cling to him fearing that he could be torn away from them at any moment. His and Uon Chhin's passports have been confiscated. For Yeang Sothearin, this means he cannot visit his ailing father, an indigenous Khmer living in southern Vietnam. Thirty-seven groups, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, last month jointly condemned the continued investigation. The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention has already concluded that Uon Chhin and Yeang Sothearin should be unconditionally released and given compensation. So, almost two years on, it's long overdue for Cambodia's government to end the pointless persecution of two proud journalists, which has become emblematic of the country's descent into authoritarianism. If they are cleared of all charges, Hun Sen could rekindle some fading hope for democracy and the freedom of expression. Libby Liu is President of Radio Free Asia.",OVAC

											Crypto-currencies and criminality: myth or reality?										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/1786179/crypto-currencies-and-criminality-myth-or-reality-,"LONDON - The recent bust of a worldwide international paedophile ring using Bitcoin payments highlighted one of the key fears surrounding crypto-currencies -- their use by criminals. Social networking giant Facebook is keen to get in on the act by launching a digital currency called Libra. But US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has aired his ongoing opposition to the move, saying many concerns remained unresolved, including ""the issue of money laundering"".  Despite tighter regulations and increased vigilance by the authorities, illegal activities related to virtual currencies remained ""significant"", Madeleine Kennedy, from the research firm Chainalysis, told AFP.  - 1% of transactions illegal - A Chainalysis report published in January said that in 2018, one percent of Bitcoin transactions -- the most widely used cryptocurrency -- involved illegal activities.   The equivalent of $600 million was also spent using Bitcoins on the dark web, a set of hidden networks where a multitude of illicit products, including weapons and drugs, are traded.  In comparison, the global turnover of drug trafficking is estimated at several hundred billion dollars.  Kennedy believes the use of Bitcoins for criminal purposes was partly based on a ""misunderstanding"".  The confidentiality reputation of the most famous cryptocurrency is unrivalled, with all transactions recorded in an unforgeable public ledger, the blockchain.  But it is ""more transparent than some traditional financial systems and certainly more than cash"", she added. The British and US authorities last week announced more than 300 arrests in 38 countries as part of an investigation that led to the dismantling of an unprecedented child pornography ring.  Investigators analysed the blockchain and succeeded in ""de-anonymising Bitcoin transactions,"" according to Ron Fort, the head of criminal investigations in the US tax services.  - Concerns about Monero -  But if Bitcoin is still the reference currency for criminals because of its popularity, they are turning to less transparent alternatives, such as Monero, which began life in in 2014, according to the European law enforcement agency Europol.  Monero's users can remain anonymous until they need to interact with a cryptomarketing platform or invest their funds with a ""wallet"" -- the equivalent of an account for virtual currencies.  It is phenomenon that also worries the German finance ministry, which recently published a document warning that anonymous cryptos could become ""a real alternative to Bitcoin"".  Monero, whose capitalisation is still 160 times lower than Bitcoin, uses a complex architecture that makes transactions ""much more difficult to track"", said Kennedy.  ""But no more than the many shell companies in the many tax havens,"" said Emilien Bernard-Alzias, a lawyer at Simmons & Simmons, a specialist in financial markets.  ""We have always seen both legal and technical arrangements to conceal money transfers from the courts,"" he told AFP, adding that only cash can be considered ""perfectly untraceable"".  Also, since Monero does not allow large quantities of money to be bought, criminals are encouraged to convert their funds and must therefore use service providers subject to anti-money laundering regulations.  Unlike currencies that have made anonymity a marketing feature, Facebook has repeatedly said in recent months that Libra will be transparent and comply with the authorities' requirements.  Libra ""will clearly not be ideal for laundering dirty money"", said Bernard-Alzias, although it will probably need to use blockchain analysts ""to satisfy regulators"", added Kennedy. ",OVAC

											Dissident Bukovsky, who exposed Soviet punitive psychiatry, dies										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/1781669/dissident-bukovsky-who-exposed-soviet-punitive-psychiatry-dies,"MOSCOW - Vladimir Bukovsky, a prominent dissident and writer who helped expose the Soviet Union's abuse of psychiatry to silence critics, has died in Britain aged 76. Bukovsky, whose health had been poor in recent years, died after suffering a cardiac arrest in hospital in Cambridge, England on Sunday night, said the Bukovsky Center, a US-based volunteer organisation linked to the dissident. By the age of 35, Bukovsky had spent 12 years in Soviet prisons, labour camps and psychiatric hospitals as a dissident who openly opposed the regime.  He was one of the first to expose the practice of punitive psychiatry in the USSR. Soviet medics issued political dissidents with false diagnoses of mental illness and incarcerated them in psychiatric hospitals where they were forced to take strong-acting medicines.  The practice became especially widespread between the mid-1960s and the breakup of the Soviet Union. ""The Soviet authorities used to call Bukovsky a hooligan involved in anti-Soviet activities,"" top rights group Memorial said on Twitter.  ""We call him a hero and say thank you."" Bukovsky first gained prominence as a student activist.  In 1963, he was arrested for possessing forbidden literature. Authorities declared him mentally ill and put him in a psychiatric hospital. He was arrested again in 1967 and sent to a labour camp for three years.  In 1971, he managed to have psychiatric hospital records for six dissidents smuggled to the West, creating an uproar. After another prison sentence, in 1976, he was deported from the USSR and exchanged in Zurich for Luis Corvalan, the head of the Chilean Communist party in a prisoner swap agreed with dictator Augusto Pinochet. He settled in Britain. - 'Licence to kill' -  After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Bukovsky came to Moscow and smuggled out top secret documents from the Communist Party's Central Committee archives. Bukovsky was a critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, claiming that the USSR and Russia were not much different.  In a 2006 article in The Times dubbed ""Licence to kill"", Bukovsky warned that Putin had pushed through legislation that would allow Moscow to assassinate its enemies in any country. Later that year, Bukovsky's friend and Kremlin critic Alexander Litvinenko died in London following radioactive poisoning. In 2008, Bukovsky tried to run for president in Russia but was not allowed to stand as a candidate. In his later years, he was caught up in a child pornography case. He was arrested by British police in 2014 and charged with making and possessing indecent images of children. He denied the charges.  The trial was suspended due to his ill health. Bukovsky penned a number of books including his bestselling 1978 autobiography, ""To Build a Castle: My Life As a Dissenter"", in which he detailed his life in the Gulag and psychiatric hospitals. On Monday, opposition leader Dmitry Gudkov recommended that Russians read Bukovsky's memoirs. ""Not a single word has become obsolete there,"" Gudkov said on Twitter.",OVAC

Manisha Dogra, vice-president for sustainability in Asia at Telenor, said the partnership is an important part of a global commitment to educate 4 million children across Telenor's markets on online safety by 2020. SafeInternetForKid.com is designed for children aged 7-16, their families and schools, featuring interactive games and downloadable resources. The website aims to foster young people's digital resilience, helping them understand when they are at risk online, know how to seek help, learn from the experience of being online and recover when things go wrong. DTAC chief executive Alexandra Reich said many young people are more tech-savvy than their parents, but that does not always mean they know how to stay safe. ""This is why DTAC has closely worked with Telenor Group to leverage the expertise of Parent Zone, the global experts in digital family life, to develop the website,"" Mrs Reich said. According to a survey of Thai children and online risk taken in November-December 2017 by Child Online Protection Action Thailand, Thai children aged 9-18 were exposed to online risks such as pornography (68.1%), cyberbullying (46.1%) and meeting people online (16%). DTAC is also working with academic institutes and Inskru, a startup that aims to empower young teachers in Thailand, to conduct both online and on-ground activities in relation to the safe online campaigns for teachers at the secondary education level and for 50,000 students in 400 schools nationwide this year. Depa president Nattapon Nimmanpatcharin said his agency has a Digital Manpower Fund that can be used as a mechanism to collaborate with other players to combat online risks and to improve Thailand's digital economy. DTAC, Depa and the Internet for Thailand Foundation have joined forces to usher in the Young Safe Internet Leader's Camp as a platform to enable youth to tackle online risks at schools, targeting students aged 12-15. At the camp, more than 200 youths and teachers will engage with experts to exchange constructive dialogue on initiatives to tackle online risks at school. The youth initiatives will be further developed into projects-in-action at schools with advice and financial support from DTAC and the Internet for Thailand Foundation. The first camp series will take place next month at DTAC House, Chamchuri Square.",OVAC

											Trial opens for Philippine journalist critical of Duterte										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/1717391/trial-opens-for-philippine-journalist-critical-of-duterte,"MANILA: High-profile Philippine journalist Maria Ressa's libel trial opened Tuesday in a case that she and press freedom advocates see as government retaliation for her news site's critical reporting on President Rodrigo Duterte. Ressa, who leads online outlet Rappler and was named a Time Magazine ""Person of the Year"" in 2018 for her journalism, is out on bail and faces years in prison if convicted under the criminal cyber-libel law. The news portal has written extensively and often critically on Duterte's policies, including his deadly drugs war that rights groups say may be a crime against humanity. Besides the libel case, Ressa and Rappler have been hit with 10 other criminal charges over the past year, prompting allegations that authorities are targeting her and her team for their work. ""The government hopes to intimidate us by syphoning both my personal time, our resources,"" Ressa, who was not in court, told AFP. ""I won't be intimidated. We continue to do our jobs. The mission of journalism has never been as important as it is today in the Philippines,"" she added. (continues below) Archive video:  

 Tuesday's brief hearing ended after testimony from one minor witness, with the case set to resume on July 30. The case centres on a Rappler report from 2012 about a businessman's alleged ties to a then-judge of the nation's top court. Government investigators initially dismissed the businessman's 2017 complaint about the article, but state prosecutors later decided to file charges. The legal foundation of the case is a controversial ""cybercrime law"" aimed at online offences ranging from hacking and internet fraud to child pornography. Ressa, 55, argues the law did not take effect until months after the story was published. Government lawyers say it is effectively a new article since Rappler had updated it in 2014 to fix a typographical error. Because the law allows the filing of charges up to 12 years after libel is committed, Ressa said it will have far-ranging implications on constitutionally protected freedom of expression as well as the way Filipinos use social media. Ressa, who has been arrested twice this year, also faces tax and corporate fraud cases, as does Rappler. The libel case has drawn international attention, with Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland and former US secretary of state Madeleine Albright expressing concern over democratic rights. Prominent rights lawyer Amal Clooney, who joined Ressa's legal team this month, said the case echoed a recurring theme in her work, where ""journalists who expose abuses face arrest while those who commit the abuses do so with impunity"". Duterte, who denies being behind the case, has singled out Rappler for criticism, also banning it from covering his public events and forbidding government officials from talking to Rappler reporters. Shortly before being sworn into office in 2016, then president-elect Duterte declared: ""Just because you're a journalist, you are not exempted from assassination, if you're a son of a bitch."" Rights monitor Reporters Without Borders ranked the Philippines at 134 out of 178 countries on its annual ""World Press Freedom"" index this year, when at least three journalists were killed ""most likely by agents working for local politicians"".

											'Sextortion,' a new cyber crime, is common: study										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/968709/sextortion-a-new-cyber-crime-is-common-study,"WASHINGTON - Sextortion -- using nude photos of someone to press for even racier content or other goods -- is surprisingly common, a US think tank says in what it calls the first in-depth study of another danger lurking in cyberspace. Sextortion can entail a hack into someone's computer to rob a sexy picture or video or take over a webcam, then the use of this content to extort victims for even more	 Most victims are minors, the predators are almost always men who prey on multiple targets, and almost all adult victims are women, it said. Most victims choose to stay anonymous, out of shame. And while US law enforcement officials acknowledge the problem, no agency or advocacy group keeps data on it, said the Brookings Institution, which published the study on Wednesday. Even the term 'sextortion' is not a real word, but rather slang that prosecutors use to refer to an offense that does not fit neatly into a single category.  Depending on where you are in America, it can be prosecuted as child pornography, stalking, extortion or hacking. But sextortion as a crime per se does not exist, the think tank said.  ""Legally speaking, there's no such thing,"" the report states. Sextortion can entail a hack into someone's computer to rob a sexy picture or video or take over a webcam, then the use of this content to extort victims for even more. It is even more common for perpetrators to resort to social media to elicit a photograph from a victim, than use it to demand more. The Brookings Institution said it studied 78 cases from recent years that met its definition of sextortion and many others that contained elements of it. - A sad first - Those 78 were prosecuted in 29 states and territories of the United States and three foreign jurisdictions.   ""For the first time in the history of the world, the global connectivity of the Internet means that you don't have to be in the same country as someone to sexually menace that person,"" the study states. Those cases involve at least 1,379 victims. But for a variety of reasons -- such as prosecutors not seeking out all victims of a given predator -- the true number of victims from those 78 cases could actually range from 3,000 to 6,500 or even more, the study said. An accompanying report from the same think tank detailed how sentencing of people convicted in sextortion cases varies wildly because some are tried in federal court and some in state court. One man accused of victimizing at least 22 young boys and tried in a state court got a prison sentence of a year. But another alleged to have had one victim faced trial in federal court and got 12 years, the study found. The key to ending the disparity, it added, is for Congress to pass a federal sextortion law incorporating elements present in federal sexual abuse, extortion, child pornography, and abusive sexual contact statutes. The first report on the offense itself also provided harrowing details of actual sextortion cases. One involved a woman who opened an email from an unknown sender and found sexually explicit photos of herself, data about her job, husband and three kids, and a demand for a porno video of her. ""And if she did not send it within one day, he threatened to publish the images already in his possession, and 'let (her) family know about [her] dark side,'"" the study said.",OVAC

											Temples no longer safe for children										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/1782969/temples-no-longer-safe-for-children,"News about monks' sexual misconduct has become so frequent that it no longer shocks. But the latest scandal involving a rapist, paedophile monk makes my blood boil. It involves an abbot in Kanchanaburi who detained a 13-year-old novice at his temple residence to sexually assault the boy at will, using power and threats on his life to silence him. After five days of sexual slavery, the boy swallowed his fear and phoned his family, pleading with them to move him to other another temple. When pressed, the traumatised boy revealed the ordeal he had gone through. The crime became public when the novice's father pressed charges against the abbot, which was followed by an order from the Kanchanaburi cleric elders to defrock the paedophile monk. A rapist, a paedophile, in the guise of a monk. This is not an isolated case. Type ""monks rape novices"" into a search engine and the ugly reality will hit you in the face. The system is sick. Seriously sick. Yet the clergy keeps turning a blind eye to these heinous crimes which are happening right under their noses to protect their image. In rural Thailand, being a novice is a ticket for poor boys to get a free education, shelter and financial support. Without proper oversight, sexual abuse is rife, both among the older and younger novices as well as between monks and novices. Often, as recently happened in Kanchanaburi, the abbots themselves abuse their authority to sexually assault fearful boys with impunity, knowing their victims cannot fight back. The novice in Kanchanaburi could escape because he has a family to ask for help. Most novices are not that fortunate. They are poor, their families live far away, and many are orphans, making them easy prey for sexual predators. Their plight is hidden in the temples' dark corners because they are powerless. This hush-hush approach to the sexual abuse of novices sometimes fails to keep a lid on the problem in the summer when mass ordinations of schoolboys into novices during the long break occurs. After sexual assaults occur, furious parents call for the monk rapists to be arrested, defrocked and sent to jail. After the scandals make the news, cleric authorities give the same empty promises of better oversight. According to the law, sex with minors under 15 regardless of consent is categorised as rape with a maximum jail term of 20 years and/or a maximum fine of 400,000 baht. The sentence can be increased by one-third if the rapist assaults a child under their supervision. They may also face a life sentence if the child is under 13. Yet most paedophile monks escape the law because they are protected by a culture of fear, secrecy and impunity in temples. Interestingly, the crimes are often revealed by the paedophile monks themselves when they post video clips of sexual acts or texts boasting about their sexual conquests on social media. How many more paedophiles are still at large in the clergy is anyone's guess. How many boys continue to suffer and how many become abusers themselves when they grow up, perpetuating the cycle of sexual violence and trauma in temples? No one knows. And the clergy does not want to know either. Their mission is to protect the clergy's name, not to save the kids. Despite the monks' frequent sexual scandals, the cleric authorities prefer to treat them as isolated crimes committed by a few rotten apples. They're not. And despite the clergy's resources, they have made no attempts to look at the problem systematically. Don't waste your time looking for records or statistics of sexual abuse in the clergy. There are none because the clergy refuses to confront the problem. A study in 2019 on monks' misconducts shed some light on the situation. According to a study by Phra Priyaphong Khunpanya on some 100 news items about rogue monks, one-third of them involved sexual misconduct. The majority of perpetrators are senior monks with high cleric education. Many are the abbots themselves. To appease the angry public, the clergy has recently set up a new rule requiring preceptors to check the criminal records of people requesting ordination. Only those free of criminal records are allowed to enter the monkhood. The aim is to fix the lax monk recruitment system. The move, however, raises many questions. For starters, those who have already served their sentences are now denied an opportunity to live a monastic life should they want to. Undeniably, the clergy's move reflects prejudice against former convicts and violates human rights. Don't forget that many of them are mere scapegoats or the poor who could not afford legal help to fight for justice. Had this rule been in force during Buddha's time, Angulimala, the ruthless murderer who killed 999 people before he was ordained by the Buddha, would not have had a chance to redeem himself and finally attain enlightenment. The clergy should follow the Buddha's example by embracing compassion, not prejudice. Also, the new rule only applies to new ordination requests when the clergy is already infested with corrupt, abusive and paedophile monks. How to weed them out? The new ordination rules would be unnecessary were the clergy to strictly observe the Vinaya or cleric disciplines set by the Buddha. Apart from being in the monkhood for more than 10 years, preceptors are required by the monastic rules to train people they have ordained for at least five years, or until the trainees can fully abide by the monastic disciplines by themselves. Nowadays, this training period is no longer observed. You can just go through the ordination ceremony and leave whenever you like. The lax recruitment and training system are not the only culprits, however. Under the Vinaya, the cleric structure should be egalitarian and the decision-making should be communal, open and participatory to prevent abuse of authority. The clergy, however, has now become an autocracy with a feudal hierarchy that commands total submission from junior members. Any criticisms or calls for reform are not tolerated and those who dare to voice dissent are subject to punishment, even ostracism. This closed system without transparency and accountability is a fertile breeding ground for corruption and abuse of power. The temple's governing structure mimics this autocracy. Under Sangha law, abbots are empowered to rule their temples like feudal lords, owning all temple assets and enjoying absolute administrative powers, especially over temple donations. This authoritarian system governed by fear enables abbots and their inner circles to accumulate wealth and sexually assault minors with impunity. Any new rules that leave the abusive system intact cannot tackle financial and sexual abuse in the clergy. Opening up the system to usher in transparency and accountability can. The monastic disciplines already provide a way out -- if the clergy chooses to follow them. Under the Vinaya, dictatorship and feudalism have no place in monastic governance. The clergy needs to return to participatory decision-making and egalitarian monastic structure that allow internal monitoring as well as external oversight from lay communities. The Vinaya also prohibits monks from being involved in money matters. They are barred from seeking or receiving money. The violations will be forgiven only when they make confessions to their monastic community and give up what they have received. Greed leads to other vices, including sexual abuse. The closed system governed by fear perpetuates the culture of impunity, allowing paedophiles to thrive. Short of cleric reform to make monastic communities transparent with external oversight, paedophiles will continue to have a field day in temples that are no longer safe for our children.",OVAC

											Blind trust 'can lead kids to peril'										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/1923156/blind-trust-can-lead-kids-to-peril,"The experts are saying it is uncommon for children to distrust those they are close to, but within the context of sexual abuse, this may be the best way to save them from life-long trauma. Up to 93.5% of 170 men convicted of sex crimes against minors admitted their victims were targeted because they were family members or someone close, Pol Maj Gen Jirabhop Bhuridej, chief of the Crime Suppression Division, told the Bangkok Post. He said these men were fathers, uncles and teachers of the victims. He was citing a study called Applying situational principles to sexual offenses against children by Richard Wortley and Stephen Smallbone. In the study, suspected abusers are labelled ""fixated sex offenders,"" who do not feel guilty about developing intimate relationships with children. Jirabhop: Cites overseas crime study Pol Maj Gen Jiraphop added that men who abuse children are likely to be repeat offenders in other types of sexual crimes. Sex offenders often find building interpersonal relationships with adults difficult and feel more comfortable around children, according to the study. Pol Maj Gen Jirabhop also said the study highlighted how sex offenders use tricks to lure children, noting aggressive offenders enjoy seeing children in pain. The CSD said 95 rape suspects were arrested by the division last year, including a man who raped his 12-year-old stepdaughter, took photos of his act and shared them in a chat group. It said earlier this year police had arrested a man who befriended a 13-year-old girl on Facebook before luring her for sex. The suspect had been on the run for six years until he was arrested in April. Pol Maj Gen Jirabhop said the tactics used in these cases are similar to those in the study. He said the suspects knew the victims well and knew how to build trust with minors. ""Don't trust anybody even if they are teachers,"" said Atchariya Ruangrattanaphong, chairman of the Help Crime Victims Club (HCVC). ""They can commit crime when they are alone with students."" Recently, a case surfaced involving five teachers in Mukdahan province who allegedly raped two students. The HCVC receives an average of five cases per year, but Mr Atchariya said there are many cases out there as many victims have been threatened against telling their parents about the crimes. Those found guilty of sexually assaulting a minor can be jailed for up to 20 years and fined up to 400,000 baht. But this may not be enough to deter criminals. Kritsanaphong: Warns cooperation is needed ""Rapists tend to repeat the offence, even after being discharged from prison,"" said Pol Lt Col Kritsanaphong Phutrakun, an assistant rector at Rangsit University and expert at the in criminology and criminal justice administration. Psychiatrists and police officers must cooperate to solve the problem, but it would be better if children ""learn not to trust people easily,"" he said.",OVAC

More generally ""the volume, scope and material cost of cybercrime all remain on an upward trend and have reached very high levels,"" the agency said in a separate statement. Most illegal activities take place in the so-called ""darknet"" or encrypted peer-to-peer networks, which offer greater degrees of anonymity to users. Traditionally live stream child abuse groups were based in southeast Asia, particularly the Philippines, but that ""more recent reports indicate that it is now spreading to other countries,"" Europol warned. ""Regions of the world with high levels of poverty, limited domestic child protection measures and easy access to children are being targeted by offenders,"" the policing agency said, without naming specific countries. ""The exploitation of children online is a huge problem for us,"" Steven Wilson, Europol's cyber crime centre (EC3) chief told AFP in an interview. Wilson added cyber crime investigators have also noticed a rise in so-called ""revenge porn"",where sexually explicit images are posted without another person's consent in order to harm that person or cause distress. To counter these threats, Europol was working on a series of information videos on the dangers of online sexual abuse, which will soon be distributed in schools across various European countries. The report also highlights other online cyber crimes, such as the growing threat of ransomware, that infects a victim's computer and then captures data, before demanding a payment for the data to be released. Whereas ransomware used to target individual victims and small businesses, it now focused on major companies and even public institutions such as hospitals, Wilson said.

Or it could be a hacker aiming for revealing images of a celebrity. Public attention on revenge porn increased after the Celebgate hack of actresses including Jennifer Lawrence	 So-called ""revenge porn"" -- or the posting of nude or explicit pictures without that person's consent -- takes a toll on famous as well as not-so-famous victims, according to a new study. A report released Tuesday found one in 25 Americans were victims of so-called ""revenge porn,"" and that many others faced such a threat. The issue gained public attention in 2014 when nude photos of celebrities including actress Jennifer Lawrence and model Kate Upton were posted online by a hacker, in the so-called ""Celebgate"" scandal. Lead study author Amanda Lenhart at the Data & Society Research Institute said this was the first national survey on revenge, or nonconsensual pornography. ""Nonconsensual pornography can have a devastating and lasting impact on victims, so it's vital that we understand how common this is and who is affected,"" Lenhart said. ""Even if images are never actually posted publically, perpetrators may use threats to post such images as a method of controlling or intimidating victims."" In some cases of revenge porn, explicit images were stolen from private online or cloud servers, while others were secretly or forcibly photographed or taped. Some images come from jilted romantic partners while others are stolen by amateur or professional hackers. Public attention on revenge porn increased after the Celebgate hack of actresses, models, and athletes, many of whom spoke of the emotional distress they experience. ""Just because I'm a public figure, just because I'm an actress, does not mean that I asked for this,"" Lawrence said in an interview after the incident. ""It is not a scandal. It is a sex crime. It is a sexual violation."" The survey found three percent of Americans have had someone threaten to post nearly nude or nude photos or videos of them online to hurt or embarrass them. Young people -- ages 15-29 -- are most likely to report being threatened. More women than men are impacted, with one in 10 women under the age of 30 saying they experienced threats about posting such content. Among internet users who identify as lesbian, gay, or bisexual, 15 percent said someone threatened to share a nude or nearly nude photo or video of them. - Men are victims too - ""It's important that we recognize that men are also victims of nonconsensual pornography,"" Lenhart said. ""Male victims are often invisible -- but hopefully this report will challenge us to think differently."" Victims' advocates have called for laws punishing perpetrators of revenge porn, but civil liberties defenders have argued these measures could violate free speech protection. According to the study, 30 states have passed legislation over the past three years attempting to define and criminalize ""revenge porn."" National legislation has been introduced in Congress without passage. The report was based on a survey of 3,002 American internet users ages 15 and older, from May 17 to July 31, 2016.

Saudi women take a selfie at a football match on September 30, 2014 at Hazza Bin Zayed Stadium in al-Ain	 TV show ""Selfie,"" which launched on ABC this week and the film ""Men, Women and Children,"" which hits the big screen later this month, both reflect the ravages wreaked by being constantly online. The ABC network's show depicts Eliza Dooley, who works in marketing but who is a social networking ""superstar"" due to her 263,000 ""followers"" on the Instagram photo sharing service. She shares with them her every move, and posts pictures of every meal and herself in every state of undress. She measures people based on their ""friends"" or ""followers"" on the Internet. But her life is upended when she finds herself a laughing stock online due to an unfortunate viral video. ""I've spent years laughing at stupid idiots on Instagram, and now the stupid idiot was me,"" says Dooley, played by Karen Gillan of recent box office hit ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" fame. To escape this online nightmare, she calls on marketing ace Henry, who tells her she has become pathetically dependent on ""the instant gratification of unearned adoration of perfect strangers."" ""When Siri is the only one there for you, you realize being friended is not the same as having friends,"" sums up Dooley's plight. The show has earned mixed reviews -- the Hollywood Reporter said it ""has potential despite cloying pilot"" aired last Tuesday. - People 'more bold' online - But it does broach some of the real problems of our ultra-connected society: the isolation of online life, the difficulty in real-life communication it highlights, the ubiquity of mobile devices at mealtimes or in the bedroom. ""Men, women and Children,"" by Jason Reitman -- who directed ""Juno"" (2007) and ""Up in the Air"" (2009) -- depicts a well-known urban scene: a street packed with people, all with their heads down locked into their smartphone screens. The movie, which comes out on October 17 in the United States, tells the story of a group of high school friends. One celebrity-seeking teenager finds herself exploited when naked photos of her leak online. An anxious mother (Jennifer Garner) seeks to protect her daughter from sexual predators by going through every single of her texts, emails or Facebook posts. But it is an uphill task. Technology is increasingly pervasive in the plots of any number of TV shows and films: think texting in ""House of Cards,"" geolocalization in ""Earth to Echo"" and recent thriller ""November Man."" Tom Nunan, a professor at the UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television, cites notably 1998's ""You've Got Mail"" by Nora Ephron as prescient about the impact of email on our love lives. ""'You've got Mail' has only grown in affection and respect over the years, as people look back... at the time, people didn't think it came at the level of 'When Harry met Sally,' but that movie has aged very well,"" he said. More recently, Netflix drama ""House of Cards,"" about a lawmaker climbing the political ladder by any means available, uses texting to ""accelerate the plot very quickly,"" said Nunan. Smartphones we carry everywhere have become ""our courage devices,"" said the academic, adding that they allow people to ""say things we would not have the courage to say face-to-face."" ""We're much more bold,"" he added. Other aspects of online behavior -- cyber-bullying, for example, or so-called ""revenge porn"" -- are ripe areas for filmmakers. One only has to think of the recent leaking of naked celebrity photos.  The film is probably already being made somewhere, or at least planned.  The depiction of our increasingly online life seems likely only to grow in the coming months and years, on the small and big screen.",OVAC

Wiphakorn 'Kan' Sukpimai and Sek Loso. He is also threatening to sue the deputy director of the Thanyarak Institute in Pathum Thani, Angun Pataragorn, who he said was among the doctors who ""invaded"" his home. In 2012, Dr Angun was in charge of Sek's case when the rocker was admitted to the institute to treat his hard drugs habit. Sek said yesterday that while there, doctors gave him too many sedatives, restrained him physically and paraded him before the media in a semi-drugged state. The row started after Sek's estranged wife, Wiphakorn ""Kan"" Sukpimai, who has moved out of the family home, criticised him on social media. She accused him of replaying ""bad incidents"" from their past, sleeping around, destroying her property and harming her physically. ""Don't hallucinate too much or you'll end up back where you were before. I'll give you a choice between Thanyarak Institute [for detox patients] or Srithanya Hospital [for the mentally ill]. I'll arrange it for you. You're in a high place, but you prefer low-life things,"" she said. ""You're just a dog. Why don't you take your evil and do it elsewhere. At the very least you should feel something towards your kids. You've taken an old incident from our past and put it on replay for us. But we have our limits,"" she said in her opening salvo on Sept 5. Inviting Sek to admire his ""handiwork"", she published an image of a large bruise on her right arm, and her mobile phone with the screen smashed. Sek initially took a light-hearted approach to her attack, urging reporters not to read too much into her remarks. ""It's not about drugs, but a husband and wife arguing. Kan is still a kid where these things are concerned. When you have problems you should keep them inside the family. But now that she's told everyone, she's brought up all that old stuff again. I'm not upset … it's just the way she feels now,"" he said. Sek said his wife was angry because he had destroyed her property. ""I destroyed three of her mobile phones,"" he said, laughing. ""I told her to come home, and stop going out to the RCA clubs so much. She's no longer a kid, but is behaving like one. She won't listen. As an adult, you have to set some strict standards,"" he said, referring to himself. Asked if they were still together, he quipped: ""We still have our marriage registration document, though I might be single for now. ""If you have evidence I'm taking drugs, bring it on! Visit me at home. If you're unsure about anything, give me a call,"" he said. ""She's not at home, because she's scared of me. She's been away a week or so. I don't know where she is, but I have many people looking for her."" In 2012, Sek was forced into rehab after Kan, during another one of their periodic problem patches, published an image of Sek smoking methamphetamine on social media. After Sek admitted taking them, his music label, Grammy Entertainment, cancelled its contract with the veteran rocker. With his career in freefall, Sek admitted himself for treatment at the institute, amid police threats of a jail term if he didn't. He has been on the comeback trail since. In their latest domestic battle, the couple had declared a truce by mid-week, with Sek pledging to clean up his language and enter the monkhood next year. Kan said she would wait for her husband, even though she held little value in his eyes. A day later, however, the battle reignited, when Kan accused Sek of sleeping with someone else, and allegedly took doctors to their home to confiscate his gun. Kan later paraded the gun on social media, saying she feared for her children's safety if she left it in his hands. Sek responded angrily, accusing Kan of taking hard drugs herself, which he said were supplied by a member of her extended family. She denied it, and said Sek was behaving erratically. She published an excerpt of a Line chat in which Sek said he was a god in a previous life. Despite the increasing gravity of their dispute, Grammy has yet to intervene publicly. At the time this column went to press, the Thanyarak Institute had also said nothing. Poj faces trespass charges Poj Anon. A deserted island resort has delivered director Poj Anon a nasty surprise after he had charges of trespass filed against him. The company that owns the Crown Nai Yang Suite Hotel, where Poj shot scenes for an upcoming ghost film in June, claim he entered the premises without its consent. Poj, who spoke to police last week about the claims, said he and his crew shot scenes at the hotel for his teen movie, Mor 6/5 Gla Tah Phi Nee Tsunami, thinking they had obtained permission. ""I'm as surprised as anyone. I'll have to talk to people at the company that scouts locations for us, as they said we had permission to be there,"" he said. Poj said the security guard at the hotel was welcoming, but when a shareholder from the company turned up a couple of days later to say they shouldn't be there, he and the crew promptly left. They resumed filming at another location. ""If we hadn't obtained permission, why didn't the security guard send us away at the outset?"" he asked. Media reports say the overgrown hotel, on Nai Yang beach close to Sirinat National Park, was abandoned more than 12 years ago. The owner, Toon Mahalap Ltd, asked a representative, Nippon Rangsimantuwong, to lay criminal charges. Mr Nippon maintains the company refused a written request by Poj's film company, Guru Films, to shoot scenes there. The complaint names Poj and Jakkrapan Janpeng, who sought the consent on his behalf. Reporters who spoke to the hotel's security guard said Poj and his crew turned up in mid-June. They told him they had permission to film there, so he let them in. However, he found out later the company had in fact declined their request. He spoke to Poj, and he and his crew left. The case is continuing. Not the nine o'clock news Sorayut Suthassanachinda. It's tough at the top, laments Channel 3 news anchor Sorayut Suthassanachinda, who was linked in the media to a porn clip in which the male protagonist bears a remarkable facial resemblance to himself. A naked man appears in the clip with a teenage girl, who media reports claim was under-age. After the clip surfaced in the media last week, reporters were quick to ask if the man in the clip was a certain well-known Thai news presenter. Sorayuth responded promptly, taking time out from his morning news show to deny it was him. He said a well-meaning person sent him the clip on Tuesday night. ""I asked my production team to look into it. We found it comes from a website that offers pornographic files. The man and the young woman are from South Korea. ""The file was posted last month and runs for seven minutes. The segment that appeared in local social media is the tail end. ""However, it's clear the couple are speaking a foreign language throughout,"" he said, adding he feels lonely at the top.",OVAC
107,107,2014-04-22 00:53:00,Prying eyes,https://www.bangkokpost.com/life/social-and-lifestyle/405949/prying-eyes,"There’s something about social media that shows us the darker side of our society, thanks to the anonymity of users. On one hand, it is good to know what others honestly think. On the other, the truth can be downright terrifying, such as the issue of paedophilia, or sexual attraction to children. The topic is nothing new — newspaper headlines are constant reminders of its existence in our society. Before the internet boom, we only heard condemning words about these criminals. Now the way people communicate has changed and evil thoughts emerge behind facelessness on social media. The recent talk about Iraq’s draft law to allow girls as young as nine years old to marry has raised a few eyebrows in Thailand, not only the law itself but in the way some Thais reacted to the news. There are raunchy comments, for example, on a Facebook page called “Loli Little”, a reference to Lolita, a novel in which the adult male protagonist is obsessed with a 12-year-old girl. Some of the users praised the idea and said they hoped Thailand would consider legalising child marriage, as well. Some even joked that they would fly to Iraq so they could legally sleep with a nine-year-old. While it is unfathomable whether the comments were honest opinions or merely sick jokes, the discussion highlighted the fact that there are people who find young children sexually attractive. Some compare sexual attraction to children to homosexuality. “In the past, people did not accept homosexuals, but today same sex marriage is fine,” reads one comment on the page. “Sexual preference is a personal choice. What’s wrong with being attracted to young children?” Nothing scares parents of young children more than the realisation that there are ill-minded people out there who would harm their kids. But ironically, what modern day parents do can actually put their children in danger — the simple act of posting pictures of their children online, equipped with location and personal information — may not be as cute as they intend. Kanya*, whose two-year-old girl is adored by her friends, finds it perfectly harmless to post pictures of her daughter on Facebook, tagging the young girl’s fans in each of the picture. On an average, she posts two pictures a day, mostly generic pictures of her girl doing daily activities such as eating, talking a walk, sleeping and taking a bath completely naked. “I set my Facebook privacy to private so I am not worried that strangers will see the pictures or steal them,” said the mother. When asked whether she knew for sure that the friends she tagged had the same privacy setting for their accounts, she could not answer. When asked whether she ever thought of the possibility that paedophiles might get hold of the pictures of her daughter in the bath tub, she drew a blank and admitted she never thought of that. She is not alone. Most parents today post pictures and videos of their children on social media. Their reasons include wanting to keep friends and family members updated about the child’s life, as well as mental hunger for “Likes” to prove their own or their child’s popularity. Anchalee*, who has a half-European daughter, also thinks that opening a Facebook account for her daughter and posting pictures of her one-year-old would lead the child to stardom. “I’ve seen many mothers posting pictures of their adorable children on Pantip’s parenting forum or who have fanpages on Facebook, and their children become famous,” she said. “I hope my daughter can one day become a child model, too. That’s why I started this fanpage.” Maja Cubarrubia, country director at Plan International (Thailand), said that parents and the society need to acknowledge that technology and social media are here to stay. There will always be technological advances that will influence people’s ways of connecting and relating with the rest of the world. “Technology, and that includes social media, is now the new tool for learning and if used properly, it can help children and young people reach their full potential and become productive members of society,” said Cubarrubia. “But we need to be aware that there are bad people around who can hurt children and young people, whether virtually on Facebook or elsewhere.” A simple Google search can reveal the ugly side of the world. There are many web boards and sites containing child porn and disgusting, perverted sexual comments about such pictures. Unfortunately, many parents are not even aware of this twilight zone. Pictures of your children can end up there, because in cyberspace, nothing is ever truly private. “Facebook has privacy settings and has guidelines around protection. Having said that, there are really mean people who can still hack the system and create problems for any Facebook user,” warned Cubarrubia. “Those who really want to do something bad will always find ways to steal them and do with them whatever it is they wish to do. I think parents need to be aware that in this day and age, with the technological development around, nothing will really remain private.” Suchada* posted a picture of her daughter swimming over two years ago. One day, her friend sent her a link that shocked her. “It was an online swimsuit shop and it used my daughter’s picture. I was horrified to see that. I would not want the world to see me in a swimsuit and I felt really bad that I exposed my daughter to such a thing. I have no idea how they got that picture, but I only posted it on Facebook. I contacted the website and although they did not reply, they took down the picture.” The public at large is sometimes not aware enough of paedophilia, and many children’s activities do not take it into account. There are photo contests urging parents to submit pictures of their children in swimsuits or in the shower to win prizes, and many parents happily oblige. Most of them don’t even bother to ask how the pictures will be used. If you think it is a far-fetched matter that won’t happen to your child, here are a few examples of what online posting can lead to. In 2012, a Boston CBS station reported that Facebook photos of local teenage girls were copied and posted on a pornography website. And it’s not only paedophiles who might have their eyes on those pictures — your enemies could use your child as revenge. In 2012, it was reported that a teenager, angry at a reporter about underage drinking, harassed and threatened the reporter’s children via Facebook and at school. Such cases have not yet been reported in Thailand, but they can happen anywhere in the world. “Just like many countries, it is not unthinkable that there will be cases in Thailand of bullying of young people because of what has been posted on social media or pictures of naked children being sold to paedophiles, for example,” Cubarrubia said. “With detailed information on a child, ill-meaning people can track them down and do physical harm, or can use the information for things that will benefit them without the child or the family knowing anything about it.” * Names have been changed to protect privacy. - Never create a Facebook account for your children. Never put personal information on Facebook, including your child’s full name, birth date, daily routines and whereabouts. - Checking in is actually a pointless thing to do. There is no need to tell the world where you are. Nothing good comes out of it and you might be providing stalkers with crucial information. - Never take pictures of your children naked, such as while taking a shower, or wearing a swimsuit. These pictures only embarrass your children later. Ask yourself — if my child could decide, would he or she post this picture? - On Facebook, if you post pictures of your child, do not tag people, because you never know their privacy setting. Only post pictures on private platforms. Do not post them on public forums or send pictures to “contests”. Even with big companies, there is no guarantee that they will protect your pictures.",OVAC

109,109,2020-01-15 04:01:00,The sad world of online gaming,https://www.bangkokpost.com/life/social-and-lifestyle/1836154/the-sad-world-of-online-gaming,"The news and images of two Thai e-sport teams that won gold medals at the recent SEA Games 2019 brought joy to people. Yet, for many people, the growth and popularity of e-sports has also led to other concerns. While e-sports as a profession has become a lucrative endeavour for some young people, not all gamers end up awash in money. While on their way to achieving such a goal, many become gaming addicts. The Radio and Media Association for Children and Youth (RMACY) studied 3,056 people aged 15-18 from September to October last year and found that a number of young people spent lots of time playing online games. During weekends and holidays, 32.56% of respondents spent three to five hours a day playing online games. Adolescents in Bangkok played the longest -- more than eight hours a day on weekends. Mobile phones allow games to be played anywhere. Around 70% of respondents played games at home or in dormitories while almost 18% played games at school, in bathrooms and bedrooms. A concern about gamers often involves violent behaviours related to the games they play. From the study, samples who played Mobile Legends, Starcraft II and Tekken 7 showed violent behaviour.  To prevent children from potential dangers posed by gaming and the internet, the RMACY recently organised a forum titled ""Online Threats To Children"" to discuss how certain online activities could harm young people. The forum focused on two main threats -- online games and cyberbullying. ""Playing a game is an activity that adolescents choose to spend time on. While playing games for long hours, they told their parents that they were preparing for a sports competition. Gaming cafes have been changed into e-sport centres, which provide instalment payments, food, bathrooms and bedrooms. Players don't need to go home,"" said Teerarat Pantawee Wongtanaanek, the study's lead author and president of RMACY. Dr Tipawan Buranasin, a psychiatrist at the Child And Adolescent Mental Health Rajanagarindra Institute, the Department of Mental Health under the Ministry of Public Health, also explained how game addictions affect lives of teenagers. ""The World Health Organisation recognised gaming disorder or gaming addiction as a disease. Young people who are addicted to games have other mental conditions such as anxiety, impulsivity and attention deficit disorder. Addicted gamers who spend time on screens and don't have proper meals have weight and height lower than average. These gamers are short and not intelligent. I met young addicted gamers who spent lots of money to top up games. A recent case spent 100,000 baht for a game,"" Dr Tipawan said. Despite a high number of gamers, Thailand has poor management to protect minors. A researcher from Srida Tanthaatipanich of Thailand Science Research and Innovation said South Korea, which has a lot of gamers, only allows players older than 18 to participate in e-sport tournaments. ""South Korea is a leading country in the gaming industry, but they don't allow minors to attend e-sport competitions. Unlike Thailand, they aim to make money from programme development not e-sport competitions. They have regulations that prevent children from becoming addicted to games. If gamers are younger than 16, they must receive permission from parents to play. These young gamers can't access online games from midnight to 6am every day,"" Srida said. ""In China, the government sets rules for minors. Gamers must verify their age. If they are under 18 years old, there are playtime restrictions. Young gamers can play only 90 minutes during weekdays and three hours on weekends and holidays. The gaming companies had to create new technologies to support this regulation."" RMACY, Child Online Protection Action Thailand (COPAT), the Internet Foundation for the Development of Thailand, the National Health Foundation and medical institutions are working together to draft legislation that would regulate the gaming industry. Tips on how to cope with cyberbullying by the Internet Foundation for the Development of Thailand ""We are glad to see the gaming industry grow, but some of their revenues are from children and parents who may or may not be willing to pay for the games. We should have a policy that regulates which games are appropriate for minors. There should be a game rating. ""Violent games shouldn't be included in any competitions. Game centres where players can sleep should or shouldn't serve young gamers. We are working together for draft legislation,"" said Teerarat. In a separate study, the Internet Foundation for the Development of Thailand found that one-third of child gamers experienced some form of cyberbullying, while another third of the victims bullied others. The study also revealed that around 40% of  cyberbullying victims remained silent and that victims tended to be girls and LGBTI more than boys. The president of the Children and Youth Council of Thailand, Supapich Thaipradit, called for a greater understanding on the cause and effects of cyberbullying. ""There is no clear standard on bullying. What bothers one person doesn't affect another. If a child observes adults and friends acting in a certain way, that child will repeat that action. Sometimes that behaviour moves online. This is a serious issue. It can lead to depression and suicide,"" Supapich said. Mangmoom, a teacher from an all-boy government school, said there was bullying and cyberbullying in the school. ""When students are bullied, most of them discuss it with their friends. They seek help from their teachers when they can no longer cope. Unfortunately, some teachers think bullying and cyberbullying are something normal. It happens every day,"" the teacher said. Kannikar Tomeena, chief of the Radio and Television Broadcasting Technology Programme, the Faculty of Mass Communication Technology at Rajamangala University of Technology Phra Nakhon, said there are five steps to cope with cyberbullying -- stop, block, tell (ask for help), remove (cyberbullying photos or messages) and (be) strong. ""In a seminar, junior high school students said they keep several Facebook accounts, with one of the accounts used to schedule fights with other students. Teachers have to use their connections to find out about these schedules. The situation is scary,"" Kannikar said. ""For parents, if your children experience cyberbullying, you must understand that it wasn't something normal. Don't tell a child that a bully will quit by himself or herself. The bullying experiences will stay with them until they grow up. Most importantly you must be friends with your children. If you are their friends, they will come to you when they are in trouble. Yet, some parents aren't close to their children. Those students will speak with their friends instead."" Kannikar explained that cyberbullying victims should stop engaging with their bully. ""The bully feels entertained when the victim retaliates to their messages or photos. If the victim ignores them, they won't have fun anymore. Then, block the bully's account. Don't be friends with her or him,"" she suggested. Supapich suggests instead of responding to a bully, people should focus on how strong the victim is. ""If the victim can't tolerate humiliation from the bully, she or he can explode. We should build up self-esteem in young people. With strong self esteem, we will feel secure and don't care about others' comments,"" she said. ""There are some suggestions that said parents should set rules about how many hours young people can use the internet and phones. Young people dislike rules. It would be better if parents discuss with their children and set rules together.""",OVAC

Account holders across the country will also be blocked from viewing the number of reactions and video views on other people's posts from Friday, but will still be able to see how people respond to their own. ""We don't want Facebook to feel like a competition,"" the company said in a statement. ""This is a test to see how people engage with this new format."" ""We hope to learn from this over time in order to see if we will roll this out more broadly."" More than one billion people use Facebook worldwide, but the social media giant has come under pressure to combat the platform's impact on mental health. In Australia, one in five children report experiencing cyberbullying, according to the country's eSafety commissioner. The problem received national attention last year when a 14-year-old girl -- who starred in adverts of an iconic Australian hat brand -- killed herself after being bullied online. Facebook's decision comes after it launched a trial in July to hide ""likes"" on the company's other major social media platform, Instagram. What began as a test on Instagram in Canada was expanded to Australia, Brazil and several other major markets. The Facebook trial was described as ""a limited test in order for us to get some early learnings."" ""While this has been testing on Instagram, Facebook and (Instagram) are different surfaces and we will likely see different data come from this test."" The social media giant did not confirm how long the trial would run for. ""We want to understand from people whether removing the total counts improves their experience, while also not limiting any positive interactions,"" said Mia Garlick, of Facebook Australia.",OVAC

											Record number of trafficking victims strains resources										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/1830439/record-number-of-trafficking-victims-strains-resources,"Thailand rescued a record 1,807 victims of human trafficking last year, according to data that campaigners on Monday said raised concerns about the nation's ability to support survivors. The number of victims soared from 622 in 2018, while the previous high was 982 in 2015, the government data showed. About 60% of those rescued last year were women and most were labour trafficked. Nearly three-quarters of them were Burmese migrants bound for neighbouring Malaysia, police said. Thailand has ramped up efforts to tackle trafficking in recent years, under scrutiny from the United States and following criticism of its failure to stop trafficking in its multi-billion dollar seafood industry, as well as the sex trade. The large spike in the number of victims uncovered by the authorities could put pressure on the nine government-run shelters that support survivors, lawyers and activists said. ""This puts a strain on the budget (for victims) and affects the ability of staff ... to provide support ... especially when there is already a low amount of staff,"" said Papop Siamhan, an independent lawyer with expertise in human trafficking. Those who are identified as trafficking victims can choose to receive help from the government, which includes staying at a shelter and being compensated through a state fund that provides living and rehabilitation expenses in addition to lost wages. Victims are also entitled to legal aid and job opportunities while awaiting trial to give testimony, or being returned home. Yet Chonticha Tangworamongkon of the Human Rights and Development Foundation, said she feared that a growing number of traumatised victims may struggle to receive individualised care. ""When a large group of people enter the shelter, it will be difficult to give them the rights they are entitled to, such as healthcare,"" said Ms Tangworamongkon, whose organisation provides free legal aid to migrant workers and victims of trafficking. Activists have questioned whether all those rescued by authorities were trafficked - which involves exploiting people for financial gain - rather than smuggled, which means entering another country illegally and is often consensual. Thailand is home to about 4.9 million migrants, making up 10% of its workforce, according to the United Nations. Most are from poorer neighbouring countries such as Myanmar, Cambodia and Vietnam and are vulnerable to trafficking, campaigners say. Thailand also announced on Monday a campaign to identify and tackle child labour in petrol stations, in partnership with the oil and retail unit of PTT Plc, the country's largest energy firm. ""Gas stations are one of the risk groups ... as some of those located up-country still employ child labour in night shifts,"" said labour minister secretariat Lieutenant General Nanthadet Meksawat. Thailand is home to about 610,000 modern-day slaves - about one in 113 of its population of 69 million - according to the Global Slavery Index by the rights group Walk Free Foundation.

											Pope Francis calls for action to safeguard women, children										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/1799069/pope-francis-calls-for-action-to-safeguard-women-children,"Pope Francis called for migrants to be made welcome and women and children to be protected from exploitation, abuse and enslavement as he began a busy two days of activities in Thailand on Thursday. Francis pleaded for action against one of the region's greatest scourges, human trafficking to fuel the forced labour and sex trade industries, as he began a weeklong visit to Asia. He praised the Thai government's efforts to fight human trafficking in a speech delivered at host Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha's Government House offices. But he appealed for greater international commitment to protect women and children ""who are violated and exposed to every form of exploitation, enslavement, violence and abuse''. He called for ways to ""uproot this evil and to provide ways to restore their dignity''. ""The future of our peoples is linked in large measure to the way we will ensure a dignified future to our children,'' he said. The United Nations considers Thailand a key trafficking destination as well as a source of forced labour and sex slaves, who are trafficked at home or abroad. The UN anti-trafficking agency says migrants come from Laos, Myanmar, Cambodia or Vietnam, with Cambodian women and children in particular trafficked to beg in Thai cities. The US State Department has faulted Thailand for failing to fully crack down on traffickers who induce young Thai girls into pornography, as well as the exploitation, including via debt bondage, of migrant workers in commercial fishing enterprises. The Thai government has insisted it has made significant progress in cracking down on human trafficking and has vowed continued cooperation with international bodies to improve. Francis has made the fight against human trafficking one of the cornerstones of his papacy, calling it a crime against humanity. Under his express wishes, the Vatican has hosted several conferences on eradicating trafficking, featuring women freed from forced prostitution. And during his papacy, an international network of religious sisters, Talitha Kum, has gained greater prominence following decades of quiet efforts to rescue women from traffickers. While Thailand has a tradition of taking in migrant labourers and sheltering people fleeing from danger in neighbouring countries, it also has a checkered history of deporting foreigners who are in the country illegally, even if they are recognised by the United Nations as refugees who are fleeing persecution. In addition, up until it signed an agreement with the UN refugee agency this year, Thailand held child asylum-seekers in detention centres. In his comments made alongside Thai officials, Francis thanked the country for its historical role welcoming migrants from across the region, who are drawn to Thailand for economic opportunities. But he said all countries must do more to resolve the conflicts that fuel the ""tragic exodus'' of forced migration. ""May every nation devise effective means for protecting the dignity and rights of migrants and refugees, who face dangers, uncertainties and exploitation in their quest for freedom and a decent life for their families,'' he said. Francis had a busy schedule on his first full day of activities of his weeklong tour, which will also take him to Japan. During a meeting with Thailand's Supreme Patriarch of Buddhism, Francis committed the Catholic Church to working more with Thailand's majority Buddhists to launch projects to care for the poor and the environment. Francis's visit was the second time a pope has called on the spiritual leader of Thailand's Buddhists, after St John Paul II in 1984. There are fewer than 400,000 Catholics among Thailand's 65 million people, yet Francis said they nevertheless have enjoyed freedom in their religious practice. He called for increasing charitable initiatives to improve fraternity and to help the poor ""and our much-abused common home.'' His visit to Wat Ratchabophit was followed by a visit to a Catholic hospital. He was to wrap up the day with a private audience with His Majesty the King and a public Mass at Bangkok's National Stadium. Friday's agenda is far more church-based, with meetings with local clergy, Asian bishops and, separately,  a meeting with leaders of different Christian denominations and other faiths.",OVAC

Mr Thanawut allegedly ran a Twitter account under the alias ""Khun Gorn"". The account is alleged to have  been registered to attract followers and sell membership to a secret website he also set up for airing sex shows.  According to the TICAC, he lured young girls, many believed to be underage, and had sex with them while broadcasting it live on the members-only website.  His Twitter page has racked up more than 50,000 followers. Many of them also paid a one-off fee of 300 baht to be members, who were given access to the website to view the live sex shows.  Mr Thanawut allegedly confessed to the crime. He faces charges of possessing and selling online sexual content involving minors.  The offences carry a jail term of 3-10 years and/or fine of 60,000-200,000 baht. Police searched his apartment and found large quantities of online pornographic material, the TICAC announcement said. Investigators were trying to find out if the girls featured in the live shows were victims of a human trafficking gang.  On Oct 22, police arrested another man, identified as Theerawut Somklaew, 27, who operated a similar pornographic website for members in Udon Thani. It was unclear if Mr Theerawut was linked to Mr Thanawut. Mr Theerawut's bank accounts were ordered frozen to facilitate a check on his money trail.

											Global darknet child porn probe leads to 337 arrests										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/1773519/global-darknet-child-porn-probe-leads-to-337-arrests,"WASHINGTON - International law enforcement authorities announced Wednesday that a global investigation into child pornography sold for bitcoin on the underground internet had reaped 337 arrests and the shutdown of the dark web's most notorious pedophile site. Authorities from the United States, Britain, South Korea and other countries said they had rescued at least 23 minor victims of sexual exploitation who were often video-recorded by abusers who then sold the videos on the now-shuttered ""Welcome to Video"" site on the darknet. The website sold the videos to users for bitcoin, which makes it extremely difficult to track the buyer. From June 2015, when ""Welcome to Video"" started up, to March 2018, the website received at least 420 bitcoin virtual currency -- around $370,000 at the time of the payments -- in at least 7,300 transactions, the US Justice Department said in an indictment. The server, which had about 250,000 videos, was seized by US, British and South Korean police on March 5, 2018 and the operator, 23-year-old Son Jong Woo was arrested and jailed in Korea. Since then hundreds of users from 12 countries have been tracked down and arrested. On Wednesday, US authorities unsealed a US indictment of Son as well as announcing the seizure of virtual currency accounts of 24 people in five countries that had been ""used to fund the website and promote the exploitation of children."" - British arrest sparked probe - The collaboration between global law enforcement agencies was sparked by the British investigation into a British scientist for child sex offenses, according to Britain's National Crime Agency. Matthew Falder was sentenced to 25 years in jail in 2017 after admitting 137 counts of online abuse, including the encouragement of child rape and even the abuse of a baby. ""The website monetized the sexual abuse of children and was one of the first to offer sickening videos for sale using the cryptocurrency bitcoin,"" the NCA said in a statement. The NCA said seven men have already been convicted in Britain since the first suspect was arrested in 2017. One man ""was jailed for 22 years for raping a five-year-old boy and appearing on Welcome To Video sexually abusing a three-year-old girl."" - Bitcoin accounts tracked - In Washington, the US Department of Justice said the site operated ""the largest child sexual exploitation market by volume of content"" when it was taken down. US authorities have investigated 92 individuals in the case. Many of those arrested have been charged and sentenced. ""This was one of the first times that law enforcement saw the use of cryptocurrency in trafficking child pornography,"" said  US Attorney Jessie Liu. ""The site hosted more than a quarter million videos and users downloaded more than one million files,"" she said. Don Fort of the US Internal Revenue Service, which took part in the investigation, said it demonstrated that criminals can be tracked on the darknet and cannot conceal their identities behind cryptocurrency accounts.

Kelly pleaded not guilty on Friday in a New York court to federal charges including racketeering that allege he systematically recruited girls for sex while touring. The disgraced superstar -- who for decades has faced sexual abuse accusations -- was brought to the Brooklyn courthouse from Chicago, where he was being held without bond on separate federal charges linked to child pornography. ""Yes sir,"" was all Kelly, dressed in blue prison scrubs, said during the arraignment, when asked by the judge whether he understood the charges against him. His two girlfriends and some family members were in court, along with around a dozen fans. One wore a t-shirt that had ""Free R Kelly"" written on the front and ""Unmute R Kelly"" on the back. A couple had also made crowns with his image on it and the words ""Justice 4 R Kelly"" The New York indictment unsealed last month says Kelly, 52, would regularly issue wristbands to girls via his associates that granted them backstage access and face time with the musician known for hits like ""I Believe I Can Fly."" Kelly would tell members of his entourage to obtain contact information from girls he wished to see again, the charges read, some of whom were invited to later concerts and provided with lodging. Girls were to call Kelly ""Daddy"" and stay inside their rooms without permission from the singer to leave, even to eat or use the restroom, according to court documents. The New York case involves five unidentified women, three of whom were minors at the time of the alleged crimes, which include coercing sexual activity. He is also accused of kidnapping one of the victims, and exposing another to a venereal disease without her knowledge. Kelly, whose given name is Robert Kelly, additionally faces charges of violating the Mann Act, which prohibits transporting people across state lines for purposes of prostitution. - 'Extreme danger' - Following the arraignment in New York, Kelly is expected to be taken back to Chicago, where he is being held on suspicion of having sex with five underage girls, recording some of it, and then attempting to hide the evidence. Kelly must attend a status hearing in the Midwestern city on September 4, having pleaded not guilty to that 13-count indictment. Last month, he was denied bond after prosecutors described him as ""an extreme danger to the community, especially to minor girls,"" arguing that neither house arrest nor electronic monitoring would suffice. Prior to his arrest in July over the federal indictment, Kelly had been out on bond in connection with state felony charges of aggravated sexual assault in Chicago's Cook County criminal court. Kelly has a decades-long history of abuse allegations, especially of underage girls.  In 1994, he wed his protegee Aaliyah, the late R&B star who was 15 at the time. After a dramatic trial, Kelly was acquitted in 2008 of child pornography charges, also in Chicago. Despite the slew of disturbing claims against him, the award-winning musician continued to perform for years and maintained a solid fan base. But he began facing renewed scrutiny earlier this year upon the release of the docu-series ""Surviving R. Kelly,"" which nabbed an Emmy nomination for outstanding informational series or special.",OVAC

Ambassador Adisak Panupong, Special Advisor, Thailand Institute of Justice (TIJ), noted that: “TIJ places the importance of child rights and child sensitivity on every dimension of the criminal justice system. We are aware that child abuse is a crucial problem on a global scale. Also, law enforcement professionals coming into contact with child victims and witnesses play a crucial role in responding to crimes against children and protecting child victims and witnesses, while restoring human rights and dignity of child victims and witnesses. This is the reason that TIJ has invited law enforcement agencies and multidisciplinary teams from various countries to come to discuss and share good practices on the issue.” “I strongly believe that representatives from various agencies attending the workshop will benefit enormously from the knowledge of expert speakers from such agencies as the NCA from UK, FBI and HSI from USA, and develop a clear understanding of child rights, ethical standards and psychological analysis of child victims and witnesses, as well as self-care for professionals working with children which will guarantee effective protection of children, access to justice, and delivery of justice.”  Pol. Capt. Khemachart Prakaihongmanee, Deputy Director of Bureau of Foreign Affairs and Transnational Crime at the Department of Special Investigation (DSI) added: “Over the past year we have worked with Interpol’s ICSE database to catch offenders in over 50 cases and intercepted over 60,000 indecent images.”   “However, catching the bad guy is not the end of the story; the problem is that children are likely to be abused repeatedly when returning to the same abusive environment. To resolve this, we need our officers to possess an understanding the knowledge of the psychology of child rights protection which involves three parties: victims, TIJ joins forces with five organizations to promote ethics and psychology for protection of children’s rights offenders and law enforcers. This will contribute to building the capacity of the forensic interview by the officers of child victims, the creation of a manual of ethical standards for the offenders, and a study of the psychological aspects of both victims and offenders.”  Continuing on the point was Mr. Robbert van den Berg, Executive Director, ECPAT, who explained that: “Sex offenders travel. They use the internet and no country is immune. An enormously worrying trend that we have seen over past years is live streaming in the Philippines, as well as online grooming; “sexting” and “sextortion” within the ASEAN region. We see an increasing collaboration between law enforcement agencies within the region and foreign law enforcement agencies. I would like to offer some small suggestions for Thailand to help combat this issue. These are: the need for more research; improvement of Thailand’s national database — a vital tool for finding and identifying both victims and prosecutors; the continuation of investment in the capacity of law enforcement and individual police officers in Thailand and recruiting more female police investigators.”  Mrs. Malina Enlund, Thailand Country Manager, A21, added that: “We have very high respect for the people working on the front lines — both DSI and Thailand Internet Crimes Against Children (TICAC) — for a long time who we have worked with. The approach that we are taking is to support the police and concerned government agencies and fill in the gaps. It is essential for NGOs to work with the Thai Government and support the police, and ensure that they are not dealing on their own with a problem that is not created by Thailand alone. We realize that we need to put more effort into not only working with law enforcement and government but also empowering them to do their job and supporting them through their journey dealing with difficult social issues in Thailand.  Dr. Lasse Schuldt, DAAD Lecturer, CPG, also commented that: “Our role in this project is to give the workshop an academic framing, draft a report on the findings, and submit our recommendations. We are boosting our efforts to introduce international standards to Thai law enforcement authorities. From a legal standpoint, we work mostly on issues of criminal procedure and victims’ rights in criminal procedures. This can relate to the interrogation of victims and to the prevention of repeated interrogations, as well as the question to what extent the rights of victims needs to be balanced against the rights of defendants. Human rights play an important role here on the side of both victims and defendants.”  Every child has rights, while the promotion and protection of these rights is an urgent global issue. Therefore, it is hoped that this workshop will lead to the creation of an actual curriculum with which Thai authorities may enhance their expertise as well as a network to establish a code of conduct and develop ethical standards with the aim of forging international cooperation in combatting exploitation of children.  TIJ aims to continue to promote children’s rights and encourage a child-sensitive criminal justice system in accordance with international standards, especially the United Nations Model Strategies on the Elimination of Violence against Children in the Field on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, as a collaborative platform for policy advocacy, research, and capacity building in Thailand, Southeast Asia, and beyond. ",OVAC

Keith Raniere, 58, coerced a string of women into having sex with him as the charismatic leader of a life-coaching group he founded in New York state.  Nxivm -- pronounced Nexium -- had proved a huge draw since its 2003 launch, attracting a coterie of rich and famous devotees like the ""Smallville"" actress Allison Mack, and spreading into cities across the United States. But Raniere swapped the personal development training courses for sex sessions as the head of a group of up to 20 women -- the youngest of whom was just 15.  He was convicted after a six-week trial on all seven charges, which also included extortion and sexual exploitation of a child, and faces up to a full life term when he is sentenced September 25.  ""This trial has revealed that Raniere, who portrayed himself as a savant and a genius, was in fact, a master manipulator, a con-man and the crime boss of a cult-like organization,"" Richard Donoghue, a federal prosecutor in New York, said after the verdict.  Followers signed up for $5,000, five-day self-help courses but some were then financially and sexually exploited and had to follow a restrictive diet as Raniere -- known as ""Vanguard"" -- exerted his control, the jury was told.  In 2015, he established a faction within the group called DOS, a pyramid structure in which the women were ""slaves"" and ""Grand Master"" Raniere sat at the top. The ""slaves"" were made to have sex with Raniere, hand over personal information and compromising photos -- and some of the women were branded with Raniere's initials as other members held them down.  - Ruined lives - ""His crimes, and the crimes of his co-conspirators, ruined marriages, careers, fortunes and lives,"" Donoghue said. While the prosecution portrayed Raniere as a psychological manipulator, the defense asked the jury to focus on whether they saw Raniere's actions as legal, even if they found them immoral.  The defendant, who vowed through his legal team to appeal the convictions, insisted that all sexual relations within the group were consensual.  ""I can't say I'm terribly surprised,"" defense attorney Marc Agnifilo said, however. ""I told the jury in my opening statement that it was an uphill battle.""

											Southeast Asian kids targeted by online paedophiles										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/1679580/southeast-asian-kids-targeted-by-online-paedophiles,"Southeast Asia is in the grip of a fresh surge of paedophile activity with predators orchestrating and watching abuse on live-streaming sites and via webcams, and paying for it with near-untraceable cryptocurrency, victims and children's charities warn. With widespread poverty, lax laws, and creaking judicial systems, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, and the Philippines have long been seen as soft spots by foreign and local paedophiles seeking out underage sex in person. Tougher policing and greater awareness has deterred some offenders, but technology has shifted the patterns of abuse in a region with growing access to broadband internet and encrypted technology. Paedophiles can now use an array of mobile and online tools — including social networks, video-sharing sites, and the dark web — to direct and watch child rape and sexual abuse with anonymity, experts warn. ""Predators watch the rapes on large platforms that are not likely to close,"" said François Xavier Souchet, of Thai-based NGO Terre des Hommes. ""It's live, nothing is recorded... everything is encrypted. They pay more and more in bitcoins — encrypted money makes their transactions as secure as possible,"" he added. This week online giants including Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Facebook are giving evidence to the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse (IICSA), which is being held in London and will look at how to prevent online sex crimes as part of its remit. 'I want to die' Demand for child sexual abuse via webcam is an increasing cause of human trafficking, according to a UN report, with suggestions Thailand has become a hub in the trade, as well as the Philippines. Cassie, a Filipina victim, said she was just 12 when she was forced to commit sexual acts — both with an adult man and alone — in front of a webcam. She moved to Manila to work as a maid but was exploited by her mother's employer. The torment went on for five years. She said: ""I felt trapped, betrayed and alone. I was thinking, 'I want to die, I want to die because of this pain, but I can't'."" Her abuser received a two-year jail term in 2017. Last month, advocacy and legal aid group International Justice Mission (IJM) warned Philippine children were at risk of being forced into live streamed sex abuse, where paedophiles pay to direct so-called ""shows"" online. ""Easy access to the web and money transfer services make the country a global hotspot for this problem,"" said IJM, noting that it is often parents or family members that organise or even commit the abuse. Terre des Hommes drew attention to the problem using a computer-generated girl nicknamed ""Sweetie"" that hung out in chatrooms and was approached by about 20,000 people — mostly men — in a matter of weeks. Last year a report by the Internet Watch Foundation found online child abuse imagery had increased by a third in 2017. Death penalty In March, a teacher was arrested and charged in his native France with rape, abuse of minors and possession of child pornography. The 51-year-old, who worked in schools in Asia, is alleged to have befriended kids in a working-class Bangkok neighbourhood before building a rapport on social networks, police sources told AFP. The same month, prosecutors charged another Frenchman with ordering videos of rape and sexual assaults of Filipino children. The suspect, a 55-year-old former police officer, was arrested after a seizure of computers and live-streaming equipment in the Philippines. In late April, former British Army officer Andrew Whiddett, 70, was found guilty by a London court of spending thousands of pounds paying for live-streamed sexual abuse of children from the Philippines. The National Crime Agency (NCA) estimates 80,000 people in the UK present some kind of sexual threat to children online. The cyber-abuse phenomenon is reaching ""Cambodia and Vietnam"", warned Damian Kean, of the Thai-based NGO ECPAT, which specialises in combating the sexual exploitation of children. In hyperconnected Vietnam, foreign paedophiles are increasingly targeting young victims online, often on social media. The communist state last year instated harsher penalties to combat the crime — anyone guilty of molesting a child under 16 faces 12 years in prison, while child rape comes with a maximum sentence of death. But catching a paedophile requires help from the communities within which they operate - communities which are often marginalised, poor and mistrustful. Souchet of Terre des Hommes explained: ""Particularly ethnic minority communities across the region do not trust local authorities.""",OVAC

											Keeping up with cybercrimes										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/1661688/keeping-up-with-cybercrimes,"One of the country's top cybercrime busters, Pol Col Siriwat Deephor, said that while there are enough laws in place to deal with crime and other nefarious activities on the internet, there is a lack of tech-savvy police officers who are adequately trained to deal with high-tech crimes. As the deputy commander of the Technology Crime Suppression Division (TCSD), Pol Col Siriwat is responsible for overseeing investigations into cybercrime cases. While he is known for his relentless battle against the trade of child pornography by online criminal gangs, recently he has been focusing on groups that specialise in creating and distributing fake information through social media, which is increasingly being used by certain groups and/or individuals to undermine their political rivals. Pol Col Siriwat was a student of Class 33 in the Armed Forces Academies Preparatory School, and a graduate of the Royal Police Cadet Academy. He then obtained a master's degree and a doctorate in criminology from Mahidol University. He was starting out as an officer at a police station in Nonthaburi, when he began to develop an interest in computer sciences and technology -- an interest that served him well and defined his career path. Later, he was put in charge of TCSD's 2nd sub-division, and subsequently, the 3rd sub-division. His job was to deal with online transnational crimes, including sex trafficking and child pornography. He was promoted as the TCSD's deputy commander in the latest police reshuffle last month. ""As an officer at a police station, I only handled thefts and other petty crimes,"" he said. ""But I was keen to learn more about the world of online crimes, and I want to see how it [cybercrime] differs from conventional crimes."" Pol Col Siriwat said that by combining the practical experience he gained when he served in the field with the knowledge he attained from studying computer sciences, he managed to make headway in his battle against online criminals -- particularly those who trade in child pornography. For example, the TCSD arrested a Moldovan national in May last year for violating the Computer Crimes Act by operating a pornographic website that raked in about 123 million baht annually. The suspect, identified as Serghei Cependiuc, 30, was arrested at a house in Thap Sakae district in Prachuap Khiri Khan, where he lived with his Thai wife. He was found to have travelled in and out of Thailand since 2009. The website contained pornographic images of underaged people, and was accessed by members who paid monthly fees of US$19.95 (640 baht), according to the TCSD. The arrest happened after the Dutch police alerted Thai authorities that Mr Cependiuc is one of the website administrators. ""When it comes to fighting cybercrime, we have to constantly keep up with these criminals who have now moved on to the internet,"" he said. ""All they need to commit a crime is a mobile phone, a bank account, plus the courage to take a big risk."" As Thailand's social media usage continues to increase in intensity, criminals are following suit and often mark their victims on social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. ""Online fraud is increasingly becoming a problem, and criminals are constantly devising new and more sophisticated tactics to stay one step ahead of investigators,"" he said. As such, it is important to educate the public -- especially young students -- about the dangers of cybercrimes, Pol Col Siriwat said. Because cybercrimes can be carried out from anywhere in the country, the TCSD has organised sessions to hone the skills of police officers nationwide to handle high-tech criminal cases. Pol Col Siriwat also said he is currently focusing his attention on tackling the dissemination of fake news, which has been used to attack political rivals before and after the March 24 election. ""The TCSD has already set up a centre to monitor fake news around the clock,"" he said. He said that while Thailand has laws which can effectively deal with cybercrimes -- such as the Computer Crimes Act -- there is a shortage of police officers that has the necessary skills to handle such crimes. Currently, there are only 170 TCSD officers nationwide. However, provincial police have set up their own cybercrime units, where people can file complaints instead of travelling to the TCSD's headquarters in Bangkok.",OVAC

Migrant workers in several industries do not get a minimum wage or overtime pay, and must contend with unsafe working and living conditions, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said in a report. While Thailand had taken steps to clean up its multibillion-dollar seafood industry after it came under international scrutiny for slavery, trafficking and violence on boats, it had done little to regulate conditions in other sectors, it said. ""The singular focus has diverted attention away from similar problems occurring elsewhere in Thailand,"" the IOM said in the report released in Bangkok. Exploitative practices have been recorded in domestic work, sex work, construction, agriculture, livestock, hospitality, garment manufacturing and other sectors, ""yet they have received much less effort and investment to improve conditions"". There are about 4.9 million migrants in Thailand, making up more than 10% of the country's workforce, according to the IOM. Most are from poorer neighbouring countries such as Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam. Since taking power in a 2014 coup, the ruling junta had taken a more restrictive approach to the foreign workforce. The country had taken some steps to tackle abuse, eliminating recruitment fees paid by workers, and banning the practice of withholding identification documents. Yet because recruitment systems and governance frameworks were not effective, workers were ""vulnerable to exploitation at various points during the migration process"", the IOM said. The agricultural sector had high levels of informal work combined with low wages and use of child labour, while sex workers faced harassment and the threat of arrest because they were not covered by Thailand's labour laws, it said. One activist said extensive media coverage and the financial implications of a ban on seafood exports had led the authorities to act, even as abuses in other sectors remained unreported. ""Perhaps people believe slavery at sea to be more compelling than slavery on land,"" said Debbie Stothard, secretary general at the International Federation for Human Rights, an advocacy group. ""So there's been far less outrage and attention to abuses in other industries,"" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Earlier this month, the European Union withdrew its threat to ban Thai fishing imports, saying it recognised the country's efforts to tackle human trafficking and improve labour conditions. In a rare victory for migrant workers, the Supreme Court on Jan 15 ordered compensation be paid to 14 migrant labourers from Myanmar whose accusations of abuse at a chicken farm sparked a landmark legal case.

											Abused children at risk from cadet ban										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/1538226/abused-children-at-risk-from-cadet-ban,"In January of this year, the Department of Special Investigation (DSI) and armed soldiers raided ""Victoria Secret"" massage parlour in the Rama IX area of Bangkok. Inside, they found 113 girls, many under the age of 18, who were being sexually exploited through prostitution. Four of the victims were Thai citizens. The rest had been trafficked from China, Laos, Malaysia and Myanmar. All were frightened, alone, separated from their families and in desperate need of appropriate legal and emotional support. Sadly, this was not a one-off event. Like many countries, Thailand remains a place where children are sexually exploited on a grand scale -- through prostitution, trafficking, in the digital/online world, and through the travel and tourism industry.

											Lecturer, probation official among alleged paedophiles										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/1517506/lecturer-probation-official-among-alleged-paedophiles,"Eight suspects, including a well-known university lecturer and a probation official, have been arrested for buying online sex services from underage boys, but senior figures asked that their names not be disclosed, said a police commander. The suspects were caught on court warrants for supporting the flesh trade and depriving boys aged below 18 of parental care, said Pol Maj Gen Kornchai Khlaikhlueng, commander of the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Division (ATPD), during a media briefing on Tuesday. Pol Maj Gen Surachate Hakparn, deputy chief of the Tourist Police Bureau and senior police officers, were also present. ATPD investigators have pressed charges against the eight suspects and sent them to the Criminal Court. They were granted bail on a bond of 300,000 baht each. Pol Maj Gen Kornchai said the customers included celebrities and university lecturers or officials, but the names would not be disclosed. Several phuyai (senior figures) had phoned him and asked that a media conference not be held for fear the names of the customers would be made public, he said. “One suspect works at an organisation overseeing legal officials and another teaches other people. Both have wives and children, but they abused underprivileged children,’’ said Pol Maj Gen Kornchai. Earlier, a combined team of police and officials from the ATPD, the Tourist Police Bureau, the Ministry of Social Development and Human Security, and non-governmental organisations jointly launched a crackdown on online sex networks providing services by boys aged below 18.  The operation led to the arrest of Namphon Somngam, alias New, 27. He was allegedly an agent and owner of “Rak Dek’’ (Love children) Line chat group. Mr Namphon has been charged with human trafficking by procuring boys aged not more than 18 into the fresh trade and disseminating child pornography into the computer system for gains.  Police took him to the Criminal Court last week and opposed his bail, said Pol Maj Gen Kornchai. Pol Col Khomkrit Sukthai, of the ATPD, said Mr Namphon used to work as a manager of a convenience store in Bangkok before quitting the job.  The suspect, who police say is also a paedophile, then opened a Facebook account “Namphon Somngam’’ to accept members who liked to watch child porn chips with a membership fee of 300 baht each. The suspect later created the Line chat group “Rak Dek’’ for these members. The man charged membership fees of over 500 baht for viewing porn clips of boys. Those who wanted to have sex with them would be charged 1,500 baht each and Mr Namphon would deduct 500 baht for his brokerage fees, said Pol Col Khomkrit. His arrest led to the rescue of seven boys, aged between 12-16, who later identified the customers, said Pol Maj Gen Kornchai. A source said two of the eight customers caught for buying sex services from boys were a well-known lecturer at a university in Nakhon Pathom and the other was an official attached to the Probation Department.",OVAC

											Australian gets life in Philippine child sex abuse case										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/1485061/australian-gets-life-in-philippine-child-sex-abuse-case,"MANILA: An Australian man has been sentenced to life in a Philippine prison as part of a notorious child sexual abuse case in which prosecutors say he chained the victims like dogs. Peter Scully still faces another trial and dozens more charges, including allegations he made child pornography and murdered a young girl. The Philippines has become a key hub for a billion-dollar, global child cybersex industry, police have warned, with operators helped by widespread poverty. Scully was convicted Wednesday of trafficking and rape by a court in the southern Philippines, three years after he was arrested there and accused of sexually abusing and filming girls including an 18-month-old baby. The Cagayan de Oro court sentenced Scully and his Filipina partner to life in prison without parole and imposed a fine of 5 million pesos ($93,700) for trafficking Filipina girls then aged 10 and 12, the regional prosecutor said. ""This is a big victory for us. This sends a very strong signal to traffickers that this government is serious in pursuing and prosecuting these cases,"" Merlynn Uy, officer-in-charge of the regional prosecutor's office, told AFP. ""These girls were lured into his apartment and they said that they were chained on the neck, like dogs on a leash."" Scully was also found guilty of rape, which carries a minimum of six years behind bars. He was arrested in 2015 in Malaybalay, another southern Philippine city, after fleeing from Australia in 2011. He had come to the Philippines to escape fraud charges in his home country. He then set up a cybersex business, filming teenage girls from impoverished families as he had sex with them or used sex toys, investigators said. The videos were allegedly sold to customers in Germany, the United States and Brazil. Most of the people who pay to view these types of sex videos are abroad, with potentially thousands of children being abused, often with their parents' consent, authorities said. Scully faces another trial for a second batch of 60 charges including the rape of an 18-month-old baby girl and the rape and murder of a 12-year-old girl. It is not clear when those proceedings will start. The Social Welfare Department said Scully's victims remained in government custody. ""The children have been traumatised. We provide them therapy to help them prepare for a normal life,"" regional social welfare director Nestor Ramos told AFP. Australia's foreign affairs department told AFP it was providing consular assistance to Scully but declined to comment further citing ""privacy obligations"".",OVAC

											Pandemic of abuse										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/1958095/pandemic-of-abuse,"Stay-at-home and lockdown measures have helped to contain the greatest public-health threat the world has seen in decades. But as Covid-19 receded in many countries, a new public-health crisis was emerging behind closed doors, with increased domestic violence against women and children. With people stuck at home and schools closed, it has become harder to tap the usual sources of support such as friends, extended family or professionals, leaving victims unable to seek and obtain help, say health professionals. Stress occurring during the pandemic and economic instability have also been catalysts that exacerbate the risk of violence, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Data compiled by the WHO showed that even in normal times, almost one in three women worldwide report experiencing physical and/or sexual violence by their partner or sexual violence by someone else in their lifetime. The UN Population Fund (UNFPA), meanwhile, estimated in May that if lockdowns continue for six months, an extra 31 million cases of gender-based violence could be expected globally. ""Often abused women and children are afraid to talk because of fear or shame. This 'window' to speak up and seek help is, during confinement, even more restricted,"" says Mariya Gabriel, the European Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth. ""As a matter of fact, in some countries, we have seen an increase in reports of domestic violence since the outbreak of Covid-19."" Najat Maalla M'jid, special representative of the UN Secretary-General for Violence against Children, shared the same view, adding that ""confinement measures and the disrupted provision of already limited child protection services exacerbated the vulnerability of children to various forms of violence"". CHILD VICTIMS Violence against children, according to the WHO, encompasses all forms of violence including abuse and neglect occurring to children under 18 years of age. It can be physical and/or emotional ill-treatment, sexual abuse, neglect, or other exploitation, which results in actual or potential harm to the child's health, survival and development. The health agency's Global Status Report on Preventing Violence Against Children 2020, released last month, shed light on the prevalence of violence against children. It estimated that 300 million children -- nearly three out of four worldwide -- aged two to four years old regularly suffer physical punishment and/or psychological violence at the hands of parents and caregivers. Moreover, one in five women and one in 13 men report having been sexually abused as a child (before age 17), while 120 million girls and young women under age 20 have suffered some form of forced sexual contact. Child maltreatment often leaves serious life-long consequences. Physically, maltreatment causes stress associated with disruption in early brain development. Extreme stress can impair the development of the nervous and immune systems. Maltreated children, when they enter adulthood, are at increased risk for behavioural, physical and mental health problems such as perpetrating or being a victim of violence, depression, smoking, high-risk sexual behaviours, unintended pregnancy, alcohol and drug abuse, according to the report. The abused person is also more likely to become an abuser once they grow up. Therefore, violence is often passed down from one generation to the next, perpetuating a vicious cycle. More alarmingly, the health agency also documented that every year, there are an estimated 40,150 homicides in children under 18 years of age, some of which are likely linked to maltreatment. The agency, however, said that a significant proportion of deaths due to child maltreatment are often incorrectly attributed to falls, burns, drowning and other causes. Even though causes of maltreatment vary, the report emphasises that it is important to emphasise that children are the victims and are never to blame. The report shows that characteristics of an individual child that may increase the likelihood of being maltreated include ""being either under four years old or an adolescent, being unwanted, having special needs, having abnormal physical features, having an intellectual disability or neurological disorder, and identifying as or being identified as LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender)"", among others. The economic costs of the lifetime consequences of violence against children are also severe: In the United States alone, the WHO estimated, the costs amount to US$228 billion per year. To tackle the problem head-on, it's necessary to break the cycle of violence to create positive multi-generational impacts, by preventing child maltreatment before it begins. This requires an approach involving multiple parties. Effective prevention approaches, according to the WHO, include supporting parents and teaching positive parenting skills and enhancing laws to prohibit violent punishment. The global community has made some progress in addressing the issue. The good news is that 89% of countries have multiple sectors responsible for addressing violence against children, while 80% reported having at least one national action plan to prevent violence against children. The less encouraging news is that only 47% of countries said these plans, laws and rules were being strongly enforced. There is also a need to develop a quality education to empower children, allowing them to acquire knowledge, skills and experiences that build resilience and reduce risk factors for violence. Further, a systemic shift in restrictive and harmful gender and social norms around child-rearing, child discipline and gender equality are required. Governments play a central role in this endeavour. To put an end to violence against children, the report suggests governments strengthen their legislative framework, having laws that prohibit all forms of violence against children, and ensure that they have agencies with a mandate and appropriate resources to coordinate action to end violence against children. The report also suggests governments prioritise data collection on key violence-related indicators and use these to set measurable targets in national action plans. ONLINE ABUSE School closures as part of government lockdown measures have affected some 1.5 billion children worldwide. With the closures, online communities have played an important part in maintaining learning, support and play for many children. However, an increase in harmful online behaviour including cyberbullying, risky online behaviour and sexual exploitation have also been identified. From Asia to Europe, cases of online child sexual abuse have soared as children spend more time online, making them more vulnerable to abusers as Covid-19 gave predators access to new groups of children who before the lockdown didn't spend as much time online. In Australia, police warned that ""insidious"" online predators were targeting new victims after a surge in coronavirus infections put Melbourne under partial lockdown. During the earlier lockdown, traffic to websites hosting online child sexual abuse content skyrocketed and such material posted to the dark web doubled, said the police. ""We suspect that offenders will use this second wave of Covid-19 as an opportunity to find more potential child victims, as young people spend an increasing amount of time online with limited adult supervision,"" Australian Federal Police Commander Jamie Strauss said. In Australia, child exploitation has been on the rise in recent years. Nearly 22,000 cases were reported between July 2019 and June 2020, up by almost 50% from a year ago, official figures show. Lockdowns have also led to the rise another insidious activity: bullying and cyberbullying. Even before the lockdown, the United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef) ranked bullying among the top concerns of children. The issue is widespread throughout the world, affecting a significant percentage of children as victims, perpetrators or bystanders. In a 2019 Unesco report, Behind the Numbers: Ending School Violence and Bullying, bullying is highlighted a major problem worldwide, with 32% of students aged 11 to 15 bullied by their peers at school at least once in the last month. In a poll conducted by Unicef in 2019, more than a third of young people in 30 countries report being a victim of online bullying. Cyberbullying, which involves the posting or sending of messages, pictures or videos, aimed at harassing, threatening or targeting another person. Although the prevalence of cyberbullying is low compared with other forms of school violence and bullying, it is an increasing problem and is on the rise during the pandemic. ""During the Covid-19 pandemic, and the related school closures, we have seen a rise in violence and hate online - and this includes bullying. Now, as schools begin to reopen, children are expressing their fears about going back to school,"" said Unesco director-general Audrey Azoulay. To prevent bullying, legislation is needed to safeguard the rights of children and underpin policies to prevent and respond to school violence and bullying, train and support teachers to prevent and respond to school violence and bullying. There is also a need to empower victims by providing information and support to children to enable them to speak up and seek help. ABUSE IN SPORT Sport is another area where child abuse has long been prevalent, but where victims have been afraid to speak out until recently. Young people, especially those who aspire to become high-performance athletes, spend as much of their time around coaches as they do with their families and are often targets of exploitation or worse. A Human Rights Watch (HRW) report published this month, which documented the experiences of more than 800 athletes in 50 sports, found that in Japan, child athletes often suffer physical and verbal abuse and sometimes sexual abuse during training. The report titled ""I Was Hit So Many Times I Can't Count"": Abuse of Child Athletes in Japan, exposed a toxic culture in Japanese sport, which involves the use of physical violence as a coaching technique. Such practices are seen as essential to achieving excellence in competition and in personal character. Many child athletes had been punched, kicked or experienced verbal abuse, while others reported being ordered to eat excessively, denied water or told to train even when injured. The ""tradition"" makes eradicating physical abuse in sport hard because coaches, parents and some players believe that there's value in physical abuse. Abusive coaching techniques documented in the report include, but are not limited to, hitting children with bats or bamboo kendo sticks, slapping children, and simulated drowning. In 2013, the Japanese Olympic Committee (JOC), promised to take steps to eradicate violence among its sports federations after an internal survey revealed more than 10% of its athletes had been victims of bullying or harassment. However, the watchdog said that not enough had been done since then and demanded organisations such as the Japan Sports Council and the JOC use the upcoming Olympics as a catalyst for change. The watchdog's national director, Kanae Doi, said that even though child abuse in sports today is a global problem, the organisation chose to focus on Japan for 2020 because the Olympics and Paralympics will be held in Japan. Young athletes are often afraid to report abuse largely because Japanese culture emphasises respecting elders, leaving violent coaches to continue their harassment, said Takuya Yamazaki, a sports lawyer who worked on the HRW report. But Japan is not unique in this domain. In South Korea, the story of Choi Suk-hyeon, a promising triathlete who committed suicide in June, also exposed the culture of malpractice in the country. The story broke when Choi's family released a diary and secret recordings in which the young triathlete documented years of physical and psychological abuse that she said she suffered at the hands of her team's coach, doctor and two senior teammates. The diaries and recordings have set off a firestorm of criticism about the corruption and abuse that critics say has long pervaded the South Korean sports community. South Korea has slowly emerged as a global sports powerhouse, with its athletes winning Olympic gold medals and other prizes. But recurring scandals have revealed widespread physical violence, sexual assault and other forms of abuse against athletes, many of whom are young, vulnerable and live away from their families during training.",OVAC

											Govt gets low scores for gender parity										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/1871649/govt-gets-low-scores-for-gender-parity,"The government has been criticised by female activists for restricting their access to justice and silencing rights advocates, ahead of this year's International Women's Day which falls on Sunday. The activists said the government has continued to engage in such actions, despite having endorsed the legally-binding Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (Cedaw) three years ago. The criticisms were aired at the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Thailand on Wednesday, where former Cedaw committee members and women's rights activists gathered to score the government's compliance with Cedaw, ahead of the official review next year. Alisar Bindusa, a representative of the Law Long Beach Youth Society, said the government is hardly following the committee's advice on amending Section 17 (2) of the Gender Equality Act. ""This law prevents prostitutes, refugees, and ethnic minorities from receiving protection on national security grounds,"" she said. ""However, the government has made progress on setting up a committee on gender equality. Accordingly, we give them a 'D-' in the constitution and legal framework."" Phattraporn Kaengjumpa, a representative of anti-gold mining group Khon Rak Ban Koed based in Loei, said social stigma and negative attitudes of officials often discourage women and children from taking legal action against sex offenders. ""The government should remove hurdles to the Justice Fund and ensure that it is accessible to all women. Only 25 of 440 women rights defenders can seek help from the Justice Fund. Therefore, we give them an 'F' in terms of access to equal justice and remedy,"" she said. Ms Phattraporn also expressed  concerns about the government's prosecution of women activists, in an effort to silence them. ""Since the 2014 coup, at least 440 have faced charges, many of which were filed simply to deny their public participation. Most of them are urban women living in poverty and those defending lands and resources in rural areas. ""They have faced sexual harassment and online abuse, but officials don't take these issues seriously. The government has also failed to hold culprits behind extra-judicial killings and enforced disappearances accountable. For this, we give them an 'F' grade,"" she said. However, the deputy director-general of the Department of Women's Affairs and Family Development, Vigita Rachatinantikul, told the Bangkok Post that the Gender Equality Act is still relatively new and little understood. ""It took effect about only five years ago,"" she said. Describing women's restricted access to justice and remedy as a ""chronic and structural problem"", Angkhana Neelapaijit, the former National Human Rights Commissioner, said the Justice Fund needs to be reviewed. ""The absence of knowledge about law and the lack of financial support are obstacles [to women seeking justice]. The constitution states that access to justice should be at no cost, but in reality it costs a lot,"" said the recipient of a 2019 Ramon Magsaysay Award. ""Moreover in Thailand, remedies for crime victims are provided in the form of financial reparation, instead of dignity restoration and accountability."" Ms Angkhana lauded the government's progress on the National Action Plan on Human Rights, but pointed out that it fails to ensure the safety of women activists. ""The plan theoretically ensures they will not be prosecuted to silence them, but what about the online attacks that they face?"" she said.",OVAC

											Bad education?										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/special-reports/1627262/bad-education-,"Sex is rarely a topic we discuss freely in Thailand. Shunned in our conservative culture, sex -- as a topic of discussion -- is received with either embarrassment, shame or laughter, not to be taken seriously or with a straight face. Such a mindset clearly explains the controversy behind Netflix's teen dramedy Sex Education, released last month. It was quite unsurprising that some Thai conservatives are throwing a fit at this hit show, despite it being received positively from critics and general audiences worldwide. Sex Education follows an awkward teen boy running underground sex counselling at his school. Over the course of eight episodes, the series covers a diverse range of issues experienced by today's teens: masturbation, abortion, homosexuality, sexting, bullying and more. It also features profanity, a clear shot of a penis, and sex scenes between adolescents. Ponlamuang Thai Party last month lobbed a complaint to the Office of the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC) regarding the series' raunchiness. On the document given to the NBTC, the party explains: ""Sex Education may suit Western society where teens get to learn about sex education both from home and at school. In Thai society, however, they haven't learnt the topic correctly, which may lead to other social problems."" The document also cites the high rate of teen pregnancy and sexual violations among the problems that need to be eradicated in the country, and asks the NBTC to consider taking down Sex Education's promotional materials that are plastered throughout the city, as they may encourage sexual urges. Here, Life explores sex education and sexual dialogue in Thailand -- from the perspectives of a teacher, a learner and a teen-health advocate. At an all-male secondary school in Bangkok, teacher Nalin (not her real name) said her students start learning about sex as part of the health-education class in Mathayom 1, beginning from studying different systems in the body then progressing to other topics through the years. Topics that are covered include sexually transmitted diseases (STD), how to use condoms, looking out for risky situations that may lead to sex, how to prevent that from happening, and more. Nalin also makes an effort to teach them to be gentlemen, respect women and refrain from premarital sex. Netflix’s Sex Education deals with teenagers navigating the social and sexual aspects of their lives. (Photo © Netflix / Sam Taylor) ""We follow the textbooks and work on worksheets. Kids also do some role-playing in class,"" she said. ""They are quite interested in the topic. They don't really get naughty about it either. Most of them are shy."" Some of the questions students have brought up in class revolve around sexual intercourse, disease prevention and masturbation. ""They do wonder if it's bad for their health if they masturbate frequently. Sometimes, students see information online and want to know more about it. But they don't really ask deep or personal questions. They tend to talk more among themselves, not really to teachers. Maybe they don't dare to discuss the problem with us,"" the teacher reported. ""I studied sex education in vocational school, like, once a week. It felt like a free period, really. We learned what each STD is about, but not how to seek treatment, test, or even advice if we have it,"" said Kritthanan Ditthabanjong, 21, head of corporate communication at the Thai Network of Youth Living with HIV, and editor-in-chief of Songsue.co, which reports on Thai media through the eyes of younger generations. The reactions he observed in class were those of mockery and laughter. Nobody seemed to take the lessons seriously. But outside of classroom, there were discussions among peers about terminating unwanted pregnancies and where to get tested for HIV, among others. ""Sex education is not just about having sex. And I'd want kids today to learn about gender, sexuality, diversity, fluidity, and that everyone regardless of differences can coexist in society,"" he added. Back in his younger days, the internet became a friend in need when Kritthanan had questions. Having watched Sex Education, he feels the series does reflect society by showing how kids don't really dare discuss sex with adults, and so they turn to alternatives to gain the information they need. ""At times, the matter of sex is treated as a joke by adults, though certain issues are big for teenagers. And when adults don't listen to them enough, or are not willing to keep an open mind on the topic, kids are unable to discuss it seriously with them too. They don't trust adults enough to open up. ""To make adults and kids come together, both sides have to find common ground and make it a safe space for discussion,"" he said. ""At least, teenagers should feel comfortable enough to discuss different issues with their family."" Are current sex-education lessons being provided in schools enough to fully equip teenagers as they go about their daily lives? Sirirath Chunnasart, adolescent and HIV/Aids officer at Unicef Thailand, says that Thai schools have to step up and comprehensively cover sexuality in their curricula. Sexuality education is also promoted by Unesco in order to empower youths to lead a healthy lifestyle. While most people have an idea of what sex education entails, not many quite grasp the concept of sexuality education, which also covers topics like reproductive health, well-being, human rights, gender equality, consent and more. Research commissioned by Unicef on sexuality education in Thailand found that the topics generally taught include gender roles, physical and emotional development, and other basics. However, sensitive subjects like safe abortion, safe sex for same-sex couples, LGBT rights, respecting different gender identities, and even what medication to take once a person is exposed to HIV, are rarely mentioned. The survey was conducted among 8,837 secondary and vocational students and 692 teachers in six provinces. It also found that most teachers taught their sex-ed classes through lectures, and not so much through demonstration, like how to put on a condom. About half the teachers said they weren't trained on how to teach sex education properly. About half the students also said they feel embarrassed and uncomfortable discussing the subject in class. ""Teenagers are mostly asked to memorise the lesson, not to discuss it. And with just lectures and not so much demonstration, it's worrying how effective their learning is or whether they'll be able to apply what they learn in real life,"" said Sirirath. ""The Thai cultural context is also limiting. Students don't feel comfortable discussing sex. Girls also face a stigma, as they will be perceived negatively if they talk about the subject openly."" The teachers and even school executives also face certain limitations. They may feel uncomfortable teaching the subject and believe it may encourage teens to have sex early if they are provided with a lot of information. Some parents may also not want their children to learn about sex. In general, the topic of sex is still largely sealed off in the country, and the classroom environment may not encourage effective learning about it, either. Hence, Sirirath said she's not surprised many people reacted negatively to Netflix's Sex Education. She added that, for people who advocate comprehensive sexuality education, they tend to admire the series for bringing to light and reflecting issues teenagers are facing. ""I think our current situation already speaks for itself on what happens if we continue to make sex undiscussable,"" Sirirath added. Teen pregnancy, STDs, and sexual harassment and violence still run rampant in the country. She suggested that education is the key to reducing it, with proven results. Several countries in Europe, especially Scandinavia, teach the subject to children from the time they're young, selecting elements that suit each stage of a child's development. ""Small children get to learn how to differentiate between good and bad touches. They learn about unacceptable acts that others can't perform on them, and this has to do with knowing and respecting their own body. As they get older, the lessons continue to add on to that. Then, they'll know and can decide when they're ready to have their first sexual experience,"" said Sirirath, adding that the age adolescents have sex for the first time has gone up to 18-19 years old in those countries. Thailand, on the contrary, has seen this number falling to 14-15 years old on average. There have also been ongoing efforts to improve the situation regarding sex education in the country, from both the Ministry of Education itself to civil-society organisations. Organisations like Path2health and others have been working with teachers to teach sex education for years. An e-learning site is also in development for teachers to gain know-how in navigating sex-ed classes effectively. As for youths themselves, there is an online consultation service called Love Care Station they can access at lovecarestation.com. The site offers information, a webboard and anonymous consultation through online chat. It's crucial to teach youths the ""full package"", Sirirath insisted, in order for them to be fully informed enough to make a decision. It is indeed difficult to fight with deeply rooted conservative ideology, though one way to do so is to involve teenagers themselves ""every step of the way"" in designing the teaching process and giving them access to healthcare services. ""Everything in the current curriculum and education was designed by people of previous generations. In order to bring about changes, we also have to change the way we work. Listening to youths, their feedback, and how each decision is affecting them is important. They should be allowed to get involved, not just be a receiver at the end,"" she said.",OVAC

											Online task force closes the net on paedophiles										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/special-reports/1292363/online-task-force-closes-the-net-on-paedophiles,"A schoolboy came to the police with a broken heart. He was utterly embarrassed but decided to tell police that a video clip of him masturbating had been distributed online and he wanted it removed. It transpired that he had fallen in love with a beautiful woman he met on the internet. They developed their relationship through video live chat, he got carried away and pleasured himself without knowing he was being recorded. He later found he was the victim of a group of transvestites who stole other people's pictures and created fake identities to lure young men like him in order to blackmail them. An investigation by the Thailand Internet Crimes Against Children (TICAC) Task Force found over 100 such video clips and dozens of victims. The task force is expanding its investigation into this case, which happened in a northeastern province. The number of teenage victims is expected to reach 200. At the same time, in another northeastern province, a similar case is being investigated in which an internet user with the identity of a handsome Thai-Singaporean luk krung seduces women he meets online, claiming to be in love with his victims. The women, some in their 30s, agreed to prove their real love even if it meant they had to have sex with a stranger as requested by the handsome man online. ""Internet crimes against children are modern crimes happening in a complex environment while the crime scenes are also 'in the cloud'. In this era of the digital economy and digital society, people live in the cloud,"" said TICAC head Tamasak Wicharaya, also an acting deputy commissioner-general of the Royal Thai Police. Each year, about 50,000 downloads and uploads of child pornography are detected in the kingdom by the task force. Such acts are now a crime in Thailand. On Dec 8, 2015, Thailand amended the Criminal Law stipulating penalties for the possession of child pornography as well as transferring or disseminating such material. The penalties include up to five years’ imprisonment and/or a fine of up to 100,000 baht for personal use, and up to seven years’ imprisonment and/or a fine of up to 140,000 baht for commercial use. A month later, TICAC was set up as an ad hoc agency to tackle internet crimes against children, with the support of Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwon in charge of national security and the officers of the Homeland Security Investigations attached to the US embassy in Bangkok. As of June 29, TICAC had received tip-offs and complaints about 129 incidents, with 36 being investigated. Out of these cases, 24 or 67% involve child pornography, eight or 22% involve child sexual abuse and four cases or 11% involve human trafficking. About a quarter of the total cases have been concluded. Among the 35 suspects, 29 were arrested, five foreigners were sent back to their own countries and one is pending charges. RELATED CRIMES Internet crimes against children, besides damaging the victims, are linked to other problems including human trafficking. Child porn images can be used to blackmail and force victims to do things against their will. Meanwhile, such material could lead to other sex crimes such as harassment and rape. Among the cases investigated by TICAC, the youngest victim was four years old. The victim, from an ethnic minority in Chiang Mai's Fang district, was held naked and photographed with the offender, who was also naked. Expert analysts said the pictures could be sexually arousing. If disseminated, they could arouse the viewers to commit sex crimes, Pol Gen Tamasak said. PREDATORS AND PREY TICAC keeps an eye on paedophiles, especially foreigners who have a history of child sexual abuse and those with a history of watching or producing child pornography, Pol Gen Tamasak said. When Thai authorities receive alerts from foreign agencies, such as the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children, the foreigners will be followed more closely. If they are spotted uploading or downloading porn images, police can request a warrant to search their residence and check their mobile phone and computer. If pornographic material is found, they are subject to a criminal lawsuit. ""Some foreigners portray themselves as a saints providing help and giving sweets to children. Once they gain trust of the children, they find a chance to be alone with them and record the victim being abused, then use the media to threaten and further abuse them,"" he added. Meanwhile, TICAC looks after vulnerable children. ""Children from poor families or broken homes are the most vulnerable. Once they fall prey to paedophiles, it is difficult for them to get over the experiences and live in society as normal. They will fall back again as a victim,"" Pol Gen Tamasak said. Poor children looking for work sometimes end up in the sex industry. Afterwards, they became subject of porn media which the offenders use to blackmail and force them to continue working in the industry, which is a recurring pattern in many cases, he added. Children from broken homes who spend a lot of time alone with stepfathers are also at risk. They are usually too frightened to speak out if they are sexually abused, he said. Reports from Khon Kaen and Nakhon Ratchasima revealed that children who have access to the internet are often lured by paedophiles who groom their victims through online communication. PREVENTIVE MEASURES Sex criminals have a higher reoffending rates than other criminals, Eric McLouglin, regional attache of the US Department of Homeland Security, said. Moreover, just as the criminals have networks to share information and adapt rapidly, authorities have to join hands and get ahead of the criminals and implement preventive measures before new crimes happen, he added. TICAC, together with its network including NCMEC, detect and locate uploaders and downloaders of pornographic material before going to search, investigate and take legal action against them before they can commit more crimes. Information from other security agencies also contribute to preventive measures. Last year, after requests to immigration police, 26 Americans were denied entry to Thailand as they had criminal records of child abuse. ""Human trafficking, especially involving children, is the most serious type of crime. The community has a right to know that you are a bad guy. We can locate where you are,"" Pol Gen Tamasak said. ""We are sending a clear message -- Thailand is no longer a safe haven for criminals,"" said the TICAC chief.  

 The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Homeland Security Investigations have organised a training course for police, social workers and non-governmental organisations. (Video by Pornprom Satrabhaya) INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION Among the cases concluded by TICAC, of the 129 incidents, information of 88 incidents, or 68%, came from foreign agencies including law enforcement, embassies and NGOs providing information about offenders, victims and the damaged parties. The FBI and the Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) have vowed to give full support to Thai police to bring wrongdoers to justice if Americans commit crimes in Thailand. Eight Americans have been prosecuted and several have been repatriated to serve penalties in the US. There are factors to consider in deciding whether to send the suspects back to their own country or to have them prosecuted in Thailand. Chief among these is the chance of a successful prosecution, said John Schachnovsky, FBI legal attache at the US embassy in Bangkok. Fighting such crimes needs collaboration from law enforcement officials, social workers and NGOs as well as the private sector, including telecommunication service providers. The special teams include victim analysts and digital forensic analysts. THE ROLE OF NGOs Many times, NGOs are the first to respond to victims. Mr Schachnovsky, who has been in Thailand for seven years, said many years ago NGOs and the police did not want to work with each other. ""Their attitude was 'we don't need them',"" said the FBI officer referring to the situation in the past. However, they later realised that they needed each other to successfully put the wrongdoers behind bars and protect innocent people. More NGOs are happy to join forces with the law enforcement team. Wirawan ""Boom"" Mosby, the 2017 recipient of the US Secretary of State Trafficking in Persons Report Hero Award, is also an active member of TICAC. The director of the Hope, Understanding and Grace (HUG) project in Chiang Mai has been providing investigative support through fact finding, case coordination and consultations with various law enforcement, social work, NGO and government officials. She also conducts key forensic interviews with child victims of trafficking and sexual abuse. She also spearheaded the opening of ACT (Advocacy Center For Children Thailand) House, the first such centre in Southeast Asia, which also has branches in Pattaya and Phuket. ""To make further progress, we need to educate and train people how to properly address these issues,"" Ms Mosby said in an interview with the Bangkok Post. ""Preconceived ideas and misconceptions have to be replaced with the right type of knowledge so that victims will be encouraged to seek help. They have to be told they are not at fault. We need more people with a heart for victims of sexual and domestic violence. It is pivotal to not prejudge their actions."" SPECIAL TRAINING Information from the victims is the key to success in an investigation, finding the wrongdoers and the prosecution. However, to get such information from victims and witnesses who have been through an ordeal is not easy, and sensitivity must be kept in mind. ""We want the entire story to come from the victim, not from us. Even if we go into the interview knowing a lot of factual information because evidence has been gathered, we still need all that information to come from the victim. And sometimes with younger children, it's a very difficult task to ask them to do that. So we need to make sure that we ask appropriate questions that a child can understand and can relate to and respond,"" said Crystal Gregory, forensic interview specialist and national programme manager at HSI. In the case of forced labour in the fisheries industry, police investigation stalled. Despite the evidence and witnesses' accounts, the police failed to get the victims' accounts. A key Cambodian victim lost his memory and refused to say anything as a result of being tortured on a boat. It took the police and related experts two years of patience and skills to help the victim regain his memory, and then he finally gave information that led to a successful prosecution, Pol Gen Tamasak said. From July 10-14, the FBI and the HSI as well as the US embassy organised a special training course on forensic interviewing of child and adolescent victims and witnesses for Thai police, social workers and NGOs including HUG from Chiang Mai, A21 from Pattaya and For Freedom International from Phuket. The course was on different skills and techniques to talk to victims of crimes such as trafficking in persons, child exploitation and forced child labour to ensure that the victims can feel safe and provide a safe environment to talk about the abuse they encountered, said Ms Gregory, one of the trainers. It also discussed victimisation, the effects of trauma and how a victim can face different problems throughout the process. The training also included steps to provide a safe environment in a neutral location, and to make sure that during the interview, the interviewers are not blaming the victims, Ms Gregory added. It was the same 40-hour basic training provided to the American investigation teams. The failure to properly interview victims will not only jeopardise the legal case but can also ruin the lives of the victims, especially when they are children, said the Department of Homeland Security's Mr McLouglin. Interviewing the victims of human trafficking and other forms of exploitation must be based on the principle of a victim-centric approach, he added. ""The interviewers need the skills and interview techniques to make sure that the victims are not re-victimised, and they must be interviewed in a safe place. Otherwise, they might see investigators as bad people and will not open up,"" Mr McLouglin said. Mr Schachnovsky said the interview must be in a friendly environment, not where uniformed police are walking around. Children's advocacy centres, currently available in Chiang Mai, Pattaya and Phuket, are examples of a suitable interview environment. The interviewer and the victim have a one-to-one interview in a room, which other investigators can watch from another room via video. ""We must keep in mind that the victims must be able to go back into society. Every part of the investigation is very important. If it fails, it will hurt the victims for their whole life,"" Mr Schachnovsky said. The group hopes to set the victim-centric approach as the standard for interviews. BUILDING TRUST, EXPANDING FORCES While Mr Schachnovsky praised the efficiency and effectiveness that TICAC has shown through its success in less than two years, Pol Gen Tamasak pointed out that it was a small team of committed people who understand each other. Meanwhile, it has gained understanding and assistance from police from different departments. They have to strengthen trust and regularly check among themselves to make sure that they are free from bad influences caused by the traumatic nature of their work. He hopes that the cooperation with NGOs can expand and more children's advocacy centres can be set up in Bangkok, Nakhon Ratchasima, Khon Kaen, Nakhon Pathom and Songkhla in the near future. TICAC currently has 40 officials from many departments of the Royal Thai Police. It is in the process of recruiting 130 more, Pol Gen Tamasak said.

											When school isn’t safe										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/special-reports/821076/when-school-isn-t-safe,"Bung* is in Mathayom 3 and is counting down the days until he can leave and finally join a school where male students are in the minority. “Three more months in hell,” Bung says hopefully. Bung is now enrolled at one of the most popular schools in southern Thailand. The 15-year-old self-identifies as a young katoey, has a small build and acts in a very feminine manner. Bung moved to the school almost three years ago and is in the elite academic stream. “I have no problem in the classroom because all my friends focus on studying,” Bung explained. “But as soon as I walk out of class, I get harassed by the boys. They’ve never hurt me physically, but I’ve been traumatised by the verbal and sexual abuse.” Bung is one of many high school students who experience bullying in what is supposed to be one of the safest places for children. Thailand has a reputation for being open to the LGBT community, but research has dispelled this myth, especially when it comes to the school environment. THE DISTURBING TRUTH Associate professor Pimpawun Boonmongkon, who heads the Centre for Health Policy Studies at Mahidol University, is always looking for ways to improve young people’s lives. Ms Pimpawun, who has a special interest in child development and education, has been researching obstacles to learning, in the hope her work can be used to improve children’s experience of school. She has found one of the main things that interferes with a child’s education is bullying, especially among LGBT students at secondary level. Ms Pimpawun’s team conducted research across Bangkok and the central, northern, northeastern and southern regions in 2012 and 2013. A total of 2,070 students participated, with 246 — more than 10% — identifying as LGBT. The research found that 11.3% of non-LGBT students were bullied physically, 12.9% verbally, 13% socially, and 7.7% sexually. But the LGBT students faced much higher incidences of attacks. At least 30% were bullied physically, 29.3% verbally, 36.4% socially and 24.4% sexually. When the numbers were broken down by region, Ms Pimpawun said the South, which is known for being socially conservative, was where the most bullying occurred. “Southern culture is a male dominant culture,” she said. “Therefore they have less sympathy and tolerance towards LGBT people. The northern region is more tolerant when it comes to LGBT acceptance.” Bung, who studies in the South, has had been subjected to weekly harassment from boys at school since he was in Mathayom 1. Bung was once pulled into a classroom by a group of boys while the teenager was walking to submit homework to a teacher. “They grabbed my chest, my bottom and my penis. Then they stripped me to see if I had boobs like a girl,” Bung said. “I was very close to leaving school but my mum told me to put up with the bullying and wait. She told me it would get better when I get older.” WIDESPREAD ABUSE Ms Pimpawun’s research helped inform a wider regional report on school bullying, sexual orientation and gender identity, called From Insult to Inclusion, published by Unesco at the end of last year. Justine Sass, a regional education adviser at Unesco Bangkok, told Spectrum school should be the most protective environment for students and a place where parents feel comfortable sending their children. Zero tolerance: Pibool Uppatham director Somsak Swaengkarn wants to wipe out bullying. But according to the Unesco report, more than half (56%) of young LGBT people in Thailand are bullied every month, while nearly a third experience physical abuse (31%) and verbal abuse (29%); and almost one quarter (24%) are victims of sexual harassment. Another study found discrimination, violence and exclusion in education often follows LGBT young people into the workforce. Bullying can occur in the playground, in toilets, changing rooms or classrooms, or on the way to and from school. It may also extend to virtual spaces through cyberbullying, which is an increasing concern given widespread internet access, particularly through mobile phones. A worldwide study of 7,644 young people aged eight to 17 years old in 25 countries showed cyberbullying was widespread. Of the 25 countries surveyed, the three in which participants reported the highest rates of online bullying were in Asia: China with 70%, Singapore with 58%, and India with 53%. Other Asian countries in the study reported lower levels of 33% in Malaysia, 26% in Pakistan and 17% in Japan. “Online bullying is worse than actual physical bullying. When a child is bullied at school, it ends at school. But online bullying exists in the cyber world for a very long time, and can come back to hurt those who are bullied later,” Ms Sass said. POWER, NOT PLAY While Ms Pimpawun’s research focused on young LGBT people, Thawatchai Pachun, a project leader from the Path2Health Foundation, warns bullying affects all kinds of students equally. The Path2Health Foundation runs anti-bullying campaigns in many secondary schools and works directly with child victims. “Our experience shows anyone can be bullied, regardless of their gender or sexual orientation,” Mr Thawatchai said. Somsak Swaengkarn, director of Pibool Uppatham School in Huai Khwang, Bangkok, has been a head teacher for more than a decade. He has worked in many schools: all boys, all girls and mixed. Each has their own problems, he said. “Single gender schools tend to have less problems than mixed gender schools,” Mr Somsak said. “Sometimes the bullying victims are non-LGBT kids and those who bully them are LGBT kids. It’s all about power and how they manipulate that.” Mr Thawatchai said potential victims include children with special needs, new students, quiet children who don’t have many friends, young people with something outstanding about their physical appearance (such as being fat or thin, dark skinned or tall), nerdy students, LGBT youth and children from wealthy backgrounds. “I read some research that found children who are bullied in school are 10 times more likely to grow up to become murderers,” Mr Thawatchai said. “If we can create a safer school environment for students, then we’ll have better quality adults in the future.” At another secondary school in the heart of Bangkok, one Mathayom 1 boy who enrolled this semester separates himself from everyone else. He can’t get along with the other pupils and has only a few friends. Once a week, a group of older students tease him, patting him on the head and demanding money. The boy gives them 10 or 20 baht to protect himself, but that doesn’t guarantee his safety. “One time I didn’t give them enough money. They hit me in the head and took my wallet. I was too afraid to tell my teacher or mum,” said the boy, who didn’t want to be named. STUDENT ARMY During lunchtime at Pibool Uppatham School, more than 2,000 students are enjoying their break from classes. From kindergarten level to Mathayom 6, there are enough of them to fill the school yard. But among all the pupils, there are 30 with an important job. They wear regular school uniform, but with a special armband. It reads “Anti-Bullying Team” and marks them out as part of a team charged with keeping the students in order. “I am part of the student committee and part of my responsibility is to make sure that every student feels safe to come to school,” said Mathayom 5 student and squad member Nithima Namtanchuan. “It was our director Ajarn Somsak’s idea to create the team to help monitor the school, since we know more students on a more personal level than he does,” she added proudly. “We don’t have that much of a bullying problem in our school,” Ticha Wongparwed, a Mathayom 4 student explained. “But I hope there will be zero bullying with hard work and effort from us and our teachers.” Wannisa Pikuntong, the school counsellor, told Spectrum the school’s anti-bullying campaign has been running for one month. Those who feel threatened by other students can write anonymous complaint cards and put them into a box. The anti-bullying squad then read the cards and consult her about any problems. “The student committee has a closer relationship to their peers than teachers. I tend to guide the team on how to consult the students. If they get out of their depth, I step in to help,” Mrs Wannisa said. Mr Somsak hopes to bring the bullying rate in his school down to zero within four years. “Besides working with the students, we also want to get parents involved with the campaign. We’ve had some incidents when fights between students were encouraged by parents,” Mr Somsak said. Since the project is new, not every student has benefitted, such as one Mathayom 3 boy who identified himself as a young katoey. He told Spectrum he still gets physically bullied by boys at school and no one seems to care. “I get punched all the time. I know I am not a beautiful katoey like others at school. I am fat and have dark skin, at least that’s what they say. They call me a big, black, ugly katoey,” he said. BOY ON FIRE While Pibool Uppatham School has its anti-bullying squad, Taweethapisek School in Bangkok Yai district is doing things differently. The all-boys school, for pupils from Mathayom 1 to 6, has been raising awareness through a short film project. Budding film-makers: The pupils from Taweethapisek School who made ‘Piratch, the Boy on Fire’. Pimonmart Putsamond, Taweethapisek’s vice-director, said the school has always been a place for gentlemen, with a long history since King Rama V. To honour this tradition, they are teaching students to respect one another like true gentlemen. “We do have some bullying in our school, just like all schools. But our problems are not serious. We know how to manage our students well,” Ms Pimonmart said. “Katoey students here are not the target. New students are more likely to be victims.” Students at the school were invited to enter a competition to make a short film promoting the anti-bullying message. Many teams competed, but the winners impressed with a story about how bullying affected two young men — a gay student and a new student. “I think gay kids and new kids are easy targets for bullies. So I used them as the main characters,” said the director of the film, Tattaporn Deethaworn. The film, called Piratch, the Boy on Fire, focuses on a gay student who is bullied for his sexual orientation by a group of boys. One day a new student comes to talk to him and they hit it off. The two date for a while, until the gay boy finds out that the new student was sent by the bullies, and had tricked him into falling in love. BEFORE IT’S TOO LATE Last year the Raks Thai Foundation found bullying affected between 20% and 30% of students who took part in focus groups at 30 elementary schools across the country. Executive director Promboon Panitchpakdi said the foundation targets its support services at small elementary schools, since “we assume big schools already have counsellors to help students”. Mr Promboon said making the distinction between teasing and bullying is important. Teasing is less persistent, but bullying is when a child is the victim of repeated physical or mental abuse at the hands of others. The foundation used different techniques to ask students about their experience of bullying, including getting them to draw pictures. They asked whether they had been bullied, if they had bullied someone, if they had seen a student being bullied and done nothing, or if they had cheered on while another student was bullied. Schools in different locations yielded different results. Students at schools in border areas, for example, were more likely to be bullied because of ethnic differences, such as accent or skin colour. But there were also universal cases of victims who stuttered or were bad at sports, students who wore thick-rimmed glasses and overweight children. Some pupils said they no longer wanted to attend school because of their experiences. “Things can get better once children grow up, but there may be a long-term effect on the self-esteem of some victims,” Mr Promboon said. Bullying related to gender and sexuality is serious because it can compromise a child’s development and leave them with negative perceptions of themselves that persist into adult life. “Our findings were surprising,” Mr Promboon said. “We didn’t think we would see this kind of bullying at elementary level.” Some pupils were bullied because they seemed to be “gay”, while pre-teen female students were targeted for starting puberty early. “Some adults may dismiss the behaviour as childish teasing,” Mr Promboon said. “But the victim feels very bad. We had a girl who was maturing faster than others and was verbally teased by boys who also tried to touch her body repeatedly. If we let this behaviour carry on, the male students grow up with the belief that it is OK to bully a woman. It contributes to gender inequality. “We target elementary students because it will be too late to change their behaviour once they go to middle school.” Getting pupils to take an active role in stopping bullying is key, he said. “The students who see others being bullied should feel the urge to help. It is a basic principle that children need to understand to live in a peaceful society. But some prefer to stay quiet.” As well as the focus groups, the Raks Thai Foundation conducted training with parents, to teach them how to help their children cope with bullying. “Some parents pay little attention to bullying because they think it’s a childish matter. But they must realise that victims can go through years of living in misery. It can have a lasting impact on both the bullies and victims. We have to pay attention to the way children treat each other in the same way we do for adults.” * Names have been changed. Handheld vice: Bullying often takes place in the playground, or on the way to and from school, but these days it also extends to virtual spaces, given widespread internet access through mobile phones. Dedicated: Pibool Uppatham school counsellor Wannisa Pikuntong helps students protect each other. Keeping order: During lunch at Pibool Uppatham School, more than 2,000 students enjoy their break. Among them, 30 are part of an anti-bullying squad. Pupil power: Pibool Uppatham School’s anti-bullying squad patrols classrooms at break times, offering help to fellow students and stepping in to support those who feel threatened. They can be identified by the special red armbands they wear at all times.

											Celebrity photo hackers 'committed sex crime'										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/430440/celebrity-photo-hackers-committed-sex-crime,"LOS ANGELES - Those behind the massive leak of naked celebrity photos that shocked the show business world could and should be prosecuted, including for child sex crimes, experts said. Oscar-winning actress Jennifer Lawrence at the Screen Actors Guild Awards in Los Angeles, California on January 18, 2014	 The online theft of the images -- including pictures of ""Hunger Games"" star Jennifer Lawrence and also of at least one under-age victim -- could also amount to harassment or a form of sexual assault. ""I think it is a form of sexual aggression and the objectification of women, and the posting of underage nude photos is fodder for sexual predators,"" said psychotherapist Dr Judi Bloom on Wednesday. ""Those who did this should be prosecuted,"" she added, explaining: ""It is not as traumatic as an actual assault, but it is psychologically damaging to the individual because it is a total invasion of who you are."" Dozens of photos of stars were posted online at the weekend, including Rihanna, Kate Upton and Kirsten Dunst. Tech giant Apple admitted there had been a ""targeted attack,"" but denied its cloud storage system had been breached. There has been condemnation, but also a sharp divide in Hollywood. LA Times columnist Robin Abcarian, for example, wrote: ""If you are a celebrity, and you pose nude for digital photos, you should not expect them to stay private. ""I maintain now, and have always maintained, that if you are a celebrity and you make a sex tape, you should not expect it to stay private.""    - Cyber-harassment -   But others sprang to the defense of those whose photos were stolen and posted online, in one of the biggest such hacks. ""Even worse than seeing women's privacy violated on social media is reading the accompanying comments that show such a lack of empathy,"" wrote ""Harry Potter"" star Emma Watson. ""Girls"" creator Lena Dunham said: ""Remember, when you look at these pictures you are violating these women again and again. It's not okay... The person who stole these pictures and leaked them is not a hacker: they're a sex offender."" Two years ago, the author of a similar online theft, that time involving pictures of celebrities including Scarlett Johansson and Mila Kunis, was jailed for 10 years. According to the celebrity TMZ website, actress and former Olympic gymnast McKayla Maroney was a minor when some of the pictures leaked Sunday were taken. The LA Times, citing unnamed sources, said those responsible could face child porn charges. Neither the FBI nor prosecutors in Los Angeles would comment on the reports, citing an ongoing investigation.   - 'Wider lesson' -   In Dr. Bloom's opinion, taking legal action could provide some comfort.  ""Suing is a way of regaining some kind of power,"" she said. The affair should sound alarm bells, ""especially for a lot of young people who send nude selfies to boyfriends,"" she said, adding: ""Anything that they post (can be sent) to anybody else."" Parents should also take responsibility, to warn their children of the dangers, she said.  One case which gripped America was that of Jessica Logan, who hanged herself aged 18 in 2008, after a naked photo which she had taken for her boyfriend was sent to hundreds of teenagers after she split up with him. While young women are the cause for most concern, men are not invulnerable: in 2010 a star student aged 18, Tyler Clementi, threw himself off a bridge in New York after his roommate leaked a photo of him with his male lover.",OVAC

											Discipline our students right										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/340787/discipline-our-students-right,"Although corporal punishment was officially banned here 12 years ago, some schools still condone the practice. Now it seems some parents do as well. When a clandestinely filmed video of a female teacher caning a student was posted online last week, it should have drawn howls of outrage. Instead the clip received more positive than negative responses. One interpretation is that some parents are content to let teachers discipline their children for them. Another is that a recent well-publicised surge in behavioural problems among students has created a backlash among the public. Both interpretations have merit. If sociologists are looking for a specific incident that might have triggered a tidal wave of revulsion, they have a variety to choose from. High among them is the case of the five-year-old kindergarten pupil who was attacked by two first-graders, egged on by a senior, at his school playground in Suphan Buri province on March 1. While one of the boys held him, the other beat him savagely, fracturing his shoulder and arm and causing other injuries, leading to blood poisoning. The boy spent several days in a coma but has now regained consciousness. This must surely rank as one of the worst cases of bullying in the history of our school system. Sadly, such uncivilised conduct does not end there. A 16-year-old student in Samut Prakan will testify to that. He found himself in the wrong place at the wrong time and had six of his fingers chopped off and his left arm paralysed when he was caught up in a brawl between students of rival schools. He had nothing to do with either of the warring groups, a fact his attackers belatedly acknowledged. After a six-week investigation, police now have three suspects in custody and are seeking 14 others. Those arrested have apologised to the traumatised victim and he has found it in his heart to forgive them. But most people will hope the judge shows considerably less mercy when sentencing the perpetrators for such barbaric behaviour. This problem of uncivilised conduct is not new but has been passed down from generation to generation and has so far defied all attempts by educators, police and parents to solve it. Our schools can be violent places and abuse takes many forms, including ridicule; discrimination against skin colour, physical appearance or social status; forcibly taking money or personal belongings; physical assault; and sexual harassment. Intimidation can take the form of insults sent as text messages by phone or hateful comments posted on social media or delivered verbally in food shops, classrooms or in school corridors. School bullying is unquestionably a horrible and discriminatory practice, but it has been a part of human nature for centuries. However, there is a line that must not be crossed. When it is, we see the kind of extreme violence that prompts society to cry ""enough"". Then society threatens to retaliate with even more violence such as reintroducing corporal punishment, as has happened in Malaysia. There are other alternatives to disciplining students, such as suspending them from school or transferring them, which carries a stigma that is likely to make even the most unruly student behave. Despite the pitfalls of our school system, the vast majority of students navigate their way through it without falling victim to its dark side. In general they are better behaved than many of their counterparts overseas, even though some standards tend to be lower and opportunities fewer.",OVAC

											Teenagers, sex, alcohol and cameras: a dangerous mix										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/tech/340514/teenagers-sex-alcohol-and-cameras-a-dangerous-mix,"A video of high school boys laughing about watching the rape of a ""dead"" drunk teenage girl who ""deserved to be peed on"" drew a horde of reporters to a small Ohio town for a trial Wednesday. A girl surfs the web on her computer on February 27, 2013 in Chisseaux, France. A video of high school boys laughing about watching the rape of a ""dead"" drunk teenage girl who ""deserved to be peed on"" drew a horde of reporters to a small Ohio town for a trial Wednesday.	 While the video and a photo of two boys lifting the unconscious 16-year-old girl by her hands and feet were shocking and extreme, the dangerous combination of teens, alcohol and cameras was far from unique. Thousands of teenagers have found themselves in social hell after sexually explicit or other humiliating pictures and videos spread through social media like wildfire. The urge to document embarrassing, malicious -- or even potentially criminal -- moments is hard to resist for teenagers growing up in the digital age with a smartphone in their pocket at all times. It's a complex problem for parents, educators and police, who have to draw a line between youthful dalliances and crimes like extortion, harassment or the production of child pornography. Most of the images start out as a moment of youthful experimentation meant to be shared with a girlfriend, boyfriend or crush. Others are meant to be a joke. Then somebody hits send and the echo chamber of teenage gossip is magnified by the power of the Internet to produce an overwhelming tide of insults and abuse. And since the images are online forever, the victimization never really ends. ""We have girls -- 16, 17, 18-year-old girls -- telling us 'I'm contemplating suicide. I can't get my photos off this site,'"" said James McGibney, founder of bullyville.com, which aims to help bullied teens and adults. One in six US children aged 12 to 17 have received a sexually suggestive nude or nearly nude photo or video of someone they know, a recent study by the Pew Research Center found. That number goes up to one in three teens aged 16 and 17, even though only two percent of the children admitted to having ever sent a suggestive photo of themselves. ""The key thing to remember about this is it doesn't take that many people in a community to send these images for them to be widely shared,"" said Amanda Lenhart, Pew's director of teens and technology research. This makes growing up a lot harder for the current generation than it was for their parents. ""In the past, an indiscretion at a party, it would have been viewed by very few people. It could die down, be covered up, you make your apologies and go on with your life,"" Lenhart told AFP. ""Now, it can be hard to escape your past."" The Stubenville, Ohio rape case was certainly not a youthful indiscretion. But the fact that the boys shared the pictures they took after pulling off the girl's clothes and that the story went viral will undoubtedly make it harder for her to recover. ""There can be some serious impacts from the severe cases where there's been both a sexual victimization and on top of that the images are shared,"" said Patti Agatston, co-author of ""Cyber Bulling: Bullying in the Digital Age."" ""You could be dealing with some pretty serious psychological issues where someone may develop severe anxiety or post-traumatic stress disorder."" At a hearing in November, the girl's mother testified that she had been ostracized at school and still cried herself to sleep as a result of the August 11 incident. These kinds of painful images do, however, help bring problems to light and make it easier to punish those who cross the line. Assistant Ohio Attorney General Marianne Hemmeter said in opening statements Wednesday that the two high school football players accused of rape treated the girl like a ""toy"" and repeatedly degraded her by sending the photos to their friends. Defense attorneys dispute the prosecution's assertion that she was too drunk to consent and insist the boys' actions do not constitute rape. A recent study by the Crimes Against Children Research Center estimated that police investigated nearly 3,500 cases of youth-produced sexual images during 2008 and 2009. Two thirds of those cases involved ""aggravating"" circumstances such as ""adults interacting sexually with underage youth or young people engaging in blackmail or other criminal or malicious behavior, or recklessly circulating images."" The good news is that most of the images -- 63 percent -- were distributed by cellphone only and did not reach the Internet.",OVAC

											Don't shoot the messenger										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/300324/don-t-shoot-the-messenger,"When members of the House Committee on Education convened on Wednesday to investigate the recent surge in vocational school violence, social critics used the occasion to point fingers at ""sensational"" media and blame it for motivating the bad behaviour. The word ""media"" used in isolation is a sweeping generality so we must assume that, in the eyes of social conservatives, TV, print, film, and online material share the blame. But, while no branch of the media openly promotes gang warfare between rival groups of students, questionable areas do exist. Although more respect for victims is being shown nowadays, TV news can be graphic and often depicts more gore than is necessary, especially when covering traffic accidents. Most game shows are banal and of no educational value, while the less said about featherbrained soap operas the better. While it is true that trashy programmes do influence young people, it is not to the extent that their social guardians fear. Most of today's youngsters are as smart as the phones they carry. Sociologists point to large expanses of the front pages of the vernacular press which are often given over to intrusive scenes of domestic violence. They cite polls which show most people support the death penalty. They claim children grow up with violence, which they become aware of through television shows, newspapers and other publications, websites, computer games and movies. They decry the fact that constant exposure could lead young people to believe this cocktail of violence somehow represents normal, acceptable behaviour. Unfortunately real life violence does play an ugly role in our society and cannot just be censored, pixelated or wished away. Ignoring reality by deliberately blurring pictures on TV of guns, alcohol or cigarettes does not fool anyone. Young people see policemen carrying real guns everyday and people drinking and smoking. They don't need TV. Two years ago screens were full of pictures of mobs on the loose, bloodshed, burning tyres, soldiers firing weapons and buildings set on fire. These were powerful, mind-searing images and none were pixelated or deliberately blurred. Nor should they have been. Despite the criminal actions of small groups of students, our younger generation is not noted for its violent and aggressive behaviour. Most pre-teenagers and adolescents have very acute senses of right and wrong and experience no difficulty in distinguishing between fantasy and reality in any media format. With proper parental guidance, only an unstable personality should be at risk. If the authorities are looking for ways to ensure a proper upbringing for our youth, they should not be blaming depictions of imaginary violence as being responsible for the real thing. It is not so much the glorification of violence to solve problems that is the danger. It is that other problem-solving strategies are not glamourised or even depicted, so a young person's imagination tends to revolve around these recurring violent episodes, as opposed to the skills of negotiation, mediation or friendliness and forgiveness. An action movie or computer game, for example, may be harmful not because the protagonist kills scores of opponents but because the hero is demonstrating that violence is an easy way to solve problems. Vocational schools can be violent and brutalising places where abuse takes many forms, including ridicule, discrimination against skin colour, physical appearance or social status, bullying and sexual harassment. Sadly this can also lead to taking blood feuds with rival schools into the streets, shopping malls and concert venues. Those who blame the media for society's failings might just as well blame the reflection they see in a mirror.",OVAC

											Facebook too big a platform to allow fake users										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/1303415/facebook-too-big-a-platform-to-allow-fake-users,"There's something in common between the amazing story of ""Nicole Mincey"", the pseudonymous Twitter user with 146,000 followers who was retweeted by US President Donald Trump and then disappeared overnight along with a few other online personae, and a recent prank by a Berliner frustrated with his inability to get Twitter to remove hate speech. The common element is the obvious solution to both problems, which rarely surfaces in discussions of trolling, fake news and cyberbullying. Social networks should be obliged to ban anonymous accounts. If they refuse to do so voluntarily, government regulators should force the issue. Nicole Mincey was apparently a fake African-American identity that helped sell Trump-related merchandise online. It was part of an enterprise supported by pro-Trump social media posts from several fake accounts representing people whose backgrounds, looks (illegally used stock photos, actually) and views might appeal to potential buyers. The whole scam blew up after the Trump retweet prompted the owner of the photo stock to look into the matter. But how many other pro-Trump and anti-Trump accounts on Twitter and Facebook are actually fake? How do we figure out which of the famous internet echo chambers are even real? The German story also involves a retweet by a top government official -- Justice Minister Heiko Maas. In a video Mr Maas tweeted this week, Shahak Shapira, an Israeli-born satirist and musician living in Berlin, explains that he tried to flag about 300 tweets violating Germany's hate speech laws to Twitter, but the few replies he received alleged that the posts didn't go against the platform's policy. Mr Shapira then traveled to Hamburg, where Twitter's German office is located, and spray-painted the tweets on the pavement in front of the office building. ""Jewish pigs,"" one said. ""If you hate Muslims, retweet,"" said another. The accounts that tweeted this used pseudonyms, of course. Germany has a recently-passed law obliging social networks to delete hate speech within 24 hours of it being reported. With the link to Mr Shapira's video, Mr Maas also tweeted a report from a government-funded study showing that Twitter only deletes 1% of hate-speech posts after they're reported by users, while Facebook erases 39% of such posts and YouTube 90%. All three platforms delete almost 100% of the posts after being contacted again via e-mail. ""#HeyTwitter, that's not enough!"" Mr Maas wrote. Both with Mincey and with the racist tweets in Germany, it took particularly persistent users to draw attention to spurious and offensive content. The networks, though they profess a willingness to fight fakes, cyberbullying and other abuses, aren't particularly proactive about it, and they have a plausible explanation: They cannot police their vast user bases, and they need a lot of help. But there's an easy answer to that defence. Neither ""Mincey"" nor most of the tweets Mr Shapira sprayed on the pavement in Hamburg would have been possible had Twitter required identifying information from users before creating accounts. The platform's anonymity -- its privacy policy specifically allows pseudonyms and multiple accounts -- gives bigots, swindlers and bullies a sense of impunity. It's not clear what else it does for users; after all, the accounts with the most followers -- those of public personalities and journalists -- are, as a rule, verified by Twitter. People don't attach much value to anonymous opinions. They may appreciate an account that specialises in a certain kind of content or even an interesting bot -- but what would be the harm in identifying their creators? Facebook, unlike Twitter, has a strict policy against multiple personal accounts and pseudonyms -- which it doesn't enforce. If an account has been reported as using a fake name or impersonating someone, it may require an image of a government-issued ID. But the company vehemently protests when people try to force it to identify users. A UK court case in 2013 is a great example. When the parents of an underage girl who had repeatedly used Facebook to hook up with men proposed the pre-identification of users, Facebook made a number of surprising statements. ""Facebook cannot proactively prevent an individual from registering and creating a Facebook account and profile,"" the company testified. ""It is simply not feasible to review over 1 billion profiles to locate a single user who may be lying about his or her name. No technical programme or mechanism exists to prevent an individual from lying about his or her identity and/or age."" All it could do, Facebook said, was shut down the girl's accounts -- the new ones she set up every time -- after the fact. The judge sided with Facebook. In reality, both Facebook and Twitter would be able to identify users if they wanted to. It would be enough for them to require a valid credit or debit card, the way one does in application stores or on Amazon. That way, all accounts linked to one card would be tied to their actual owner, and underage users' accounts would be tied to their parents' identities. This would immediately resolve the problems of fake names, anonymous bullies, troll armies and hate-speech law violations. There would still be cases of identity theft, but the platforms could easily alert a user if a new account attempted to use his or her card data. Such identification would hurt whistleblowers and opposition activists in oppressive regimes. But, for their own safety, those who want to hide their identities should stay off Facebook and Twitter, anyway: There's a greater chance that a hostile government or corporation will track them down there than on more secure, encrypted messaging platforms or on the Dark Web. There's plenty of anonymity to be had on the internet. There is, however, no reason the huge corporate platforms (which essentially trade in our personal information) should be allowed to get on a high horse as defenders of privacy. These platforms have as little to do with the internet's early ideals as today's Apple has with the company Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak launched in a garage in the 1970s. They should be regulated in the same way as a TV station or a newspaper, which always knows the authors of the information it publishes. The social platforms hold on desperately to anonymity because it's the basis for their inflated user numbers, which they sell to advertisers and the stock market. If they give it up -- in reality, not just on paper like Facebook -- competitors will spring up to offer it. They should face up to their responsibility and start caring whether their users are real -- and why they might not want to give their real names if they are. (Bloomberg View) Leonid Bershidsky is a Bloomberg View columnist.",OVAA

											The flipside to 'Nott'										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/1133365/the-flipside-to-nott,"As social media becomes the bright shining tool for normal people to unearth irregularities and fight injustice, incidents of cyberbullying are lurking in the shadows and becoming an increasing cause for concern. Thailand is among the top countries in the world in terms of social media users. About 60% of the population or more than 40 million people are Facebook subscribers while more than 26 million are on YouTube. It is no exaggeration to say that there is no talk of the town, major scandal, or newsworthy opinion that do not find their underpinning on the new media platform. While their connectedness, easy access and massive reach have made social media, whether Facebook, YouTube, Twitter or Instagram, successful tools in empowering people and giving them a sense of social equalisation, the very same capabilities have given rise to a worrying trend toward hate speech, trolling and cyberbullying. An example can be found in the latest case of a TV talk show host who became the subject of nationwide condemnation overnight after a video clip, which showed him repeatedly punching a motorcyclist and telling him to prostrate to his car, went viral last week. Akanat ""Nott"" Ariyaritwikul, 28, was filmed as he accused the motorcycle driver of hitting the tail light of his car, a Mini Cooper that costs more than two million baht, and trying to flee the scene. In an apparent rage, the celebrity not only punched the motorcyclist in the face a few times but also told him to kraab rot ku, or get down on the ground and pay respect to the car. The incident took place last Friday and the two men settled their conflict on the same day, according to police. It was after the video clip showing Akanat's violent outburst and demeaning demands later became available online that a public furore erupted. The backlash against Akanat, not so much for his resorting to violence to settle the conflict over what appeared to be a minor accident, than his seemingly mean-spirited demand for the man to pay respect to his car, was so strong that his employer GMMTV decided to terminate his contract. Thai PBS suspended the airing of the programme Thailand Science Challenge, which Akanat hosts. An organisation which gave him a role model award in September asked that the accolade be returned as well. But these are not all the punishments. In venting their anger, ten of thousands of Facebook users left messages criticising the TV talk show host not only on his account but wherever his photos appeared. Some took to lambasting his parents. Many also reportedly harassed a restaurant where Akanat is an investment partner and campaigned for people to stop patronising the place. It is ironic that people who denounced Akanat's violent behaviour would post messages threatening not just the talk show host but his family and those associated with him on online and social media forums. Many publicly urged people to boycott the celebrity until he has no place left in society. This form of social sanction is obviously going too far. Following the public uproar, Akanat was faced with a new police complaint for physical assault by the injured motorcyclist who received hit-and-run complaint in return. The case is in the hands of police who have promised to handle it with speed and care. The cyberbullying must stop. The kraab rot ku scandal has reinforced the belief that social media sanctions work effectively in setting the record straight when it comes to improper behaviour. The unwelcome byproducts of trolling and cyberbullying, however, must be curtailed before they spiral completely out of control.",OVAA

Twitter began implementing a new policy aimed at curbing use of the network to incite violence, and to crack down on abuse and harassment	 The new rules are the latest implemented by social networks aiming to stem violence and harassment while attempting to safeguard freedom of online speech. ""We need to ensure that voices are not silenced because people are afraid to speak up,"" said Twitter's head of product management Shreyas Doshi in a blog post. ""To that end, we are today announcing our latest product and policy updates that will help us in continuing to develop a platform on which users can safely engage with the world at large."" Some of the changes were outlined last week in a Washington Post column by Twitter general counsel Vijaya Gadde. On Tuesday, Doshi noted that Twitter had updated its  policy on violent threats ""so that the prohibition is not limited to 'direct, specific threats of violence against others' but now extends to 'threats of violence against others or promot(ing) violence against others."" He said the previous policy ""was unduly narrow and limited our ability to act on certain kinds of threatening behavior."" Twitter's new policy also allows the social network to ""lock"" abusive accounts for specific periods of time, which could help crack down on so-called cyberbullying and spam. ""This option gives us leverage in a variety of contexts, particularly where multiple users begin harassing a particular person or group of people,"" Doshi said. Doshi also noted that Twitter would be testing ""a product feature to help us identify suspected abusive Tweets and limit their reach."" The new tool, which was not described in detail, could help Twitter identify abusive activity by looking at ""a wide range of signals and context that frequently correlates with abuse including the age of the account itself, and the similarity of a tweet to other content that our safety team has in the past independently determined to be abusive,"" said Doshi. This tool ""will not affect your ability to see content that you've explicitly sought out, such as tweets from accounts you follow, but instead is designed to help us limit the potential harm of abusive content,"" he noted. Twitter's actions follow initiatives by Facebook as well as Facebook-owned Instagram that aim to crack down on abusive conduct and use of the platforms to promote violence. Social networks have been struggling with defining acceptable content and freedom of expression, and radical extremism and violence increasingly linked to these services. Facebook said last month it will not allow the social network to be used to promote terrorism or hate speech as it unveiled a wide-ranging update of its ""community standards.""",OVAA

The 36 were arrested in a raid on Monday on a supposed Internet cafe that was actually being used to sell pictures and videos of naked women to US clients, said local police officer Myra Sapa. Those detained would chat with clients via online messaging, posing as women and offering to disrobe and perform live sex acts in front of a webcam, said Sapa, based in the northern city of Dinalupihan where the raid took place.

Acting on an arrest warrant by the Criminal Court, the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Division (ATPD) and the Thailand Internet Crimes Against Children (TICAC) Task Force arrested Natthawut Klinhom, 20, a native of Chiang Mai. Mr Natthawut has been charged with extortion. According to the authorities, the victim, 19, filed a complaint against Mr Natthawut accusing him of blackmail. The victim said he met Mr Natthawut as a woman online and started a romantic relationship on social media. He said Mr Natthawut started asking for nude photos and he obliged.

The student initially paid, but he could no longer do so after spending 19,000 baht to prevent Mr Natthawut from publishing the photos.

											'Sextortion' a blind spot in fight against corruption										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/700812/sextortion-a-blind-spot-in-fight-against-corruption,"The US immigration officer told a young Colombian woman that he wanted sex, once or twice, and in return would give her a green card, the coveted document that would allow her to live and work in the United States permanently. What he did not know was that the conversation was recorded on a digital camera in her pocket and used as evidence in a case of ""sextortion"", a form of corruption that involves officials abusing their power to obtain a sexual favour. ""Sextortion is very widespread, but it is one of the hardest-to-prove forms of corruption,"" said Nancy Hendry, senior adviseor at the International Association of Women Judges (IAWJ). Statistics are hard to come by but Interpol says reports indicate that sextortion is a growing problem with hundreds of thousands of victims around the world. Prosecutors often have hard evidence and anti-corruption laws to charge people in positions of authority caught taking bribes. But when sex is involved, prosecution is harder because evidence is elusive, the law is unclear and victims often are reluctant to come forward for fear of being shamed. As a result, corruption prosecutions for sextortion remain relatively few. Through heightened awareness, the judges hope to see sextortion get the same attention and penalties as sexual harassment and domestic violence -- crimes that were once ignored or unquestioned. ""People tend to dismiss is, partly because it is seen as part of life,"" Hendry told delegates at the International Anti-Corruption Conference in Malaysia last week. ""But it shouldn't be, just like sexual harassment or domestic violence are unacceptable."" The demand for a sexual favour can be explicit or implicit, and usually employs fear rather than physical forms of coercion. It does not have to involve sexual intercourse or even physical touching, but could be any form of unwanted sexual activity, including exposing body parts or posing for sexual photographs or videos, the IAWJ says. Many sextortion cases happen in the workplace or in educational institutions, where ""sex for grades"" cases may be prosecuted under sexual harassment laws. Han Chee Rull, deputy commissioner at the office of legal research of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission, said sextortion was hard to prove as it is carried out in secrecy. ""Proof is also often hard to obtain due to a lack of evidence of physical violence because perpetrators and victims exchange sexual favours as a quid pro quo -- an exchange of services,"" he told delegates, adding that Malaysia has prosecuted only two cases. Justice Engera Kileo, chairwoman of the Tanzania Women Judges Association, said Tanzania in 2007 recognised the solicitation of sexual favours through abuse of authority as a form of corruption, but the law was too weak to deal with sextortion cases. ""Building awareness and training officials is a key part of our work to stop sextortion from happening in the first place,"" she said. A 2014 study by the IAWJ and the Thomson Reuters Foundation on laws in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Kenya, Mexico, Taiwan, Uganda and the UK found that none of the nine countries had adopted laws that actually use the term sextortion. Interpol has warned that as internet access continues to expand, especially in developing countries, there are likely to be more victims as explicit material is posted online to blackmail people. An Interpol-coordinated operation targeting organised crime networks behind sextortion cases around the world resulted in the arrest of 58 people last year. Thomson Reuters Foundation",OVAA

The body of Goo, a member of former girl group Kara, was discovered Sunday evening at her home in Cheongdam, one of Seoul's wealthiest neighbourhoods. Police were still investigating her cause of death and Yonhap news agency reported they were ""keeping the possibility of suicide in consideration"". In May, the 28-year-old star apologised to her fans after being hospitalised following a suspected suicide attempt, saying she had been ""in agony over a number of issues"". Goo was abused by an ex-boyfriend last year who -- after they split -- blackmailed her over their sex videos. The ex, hairdresser Choi Jong-bum, threatened ""to end her entertainment career"" by leaking the footage, and a CCTV clip of the couple showed the singer kneeling before him apparently begging him not to. In the conservative South, women who appear in such videos often feel shame -- despite being the victims -- and face ostracism and social isolation if the images become public. The man was convicted of multiple crimes including blackmail in August and was given a suspended jail term, but the star had been targeted by abusive online comments since the incident. Before her body was discovered on Sunday her Instagram account was flooded with hate comments about her appearance and her history with her ex. Goo made her debut in 2008 with Kara -- for several years one of the two biggest K-pop girl groups -- and pursued a solo career after the group broke up, completing a tour of Japan last week. Her death sparked an online petition on the website of the South’s presidential office calling for stronger punishments for cybercrimes and abusive online comments, which garnered more than 20,000 signatures in less than a day. ""It was not long ago that we lost someone through hate comments and this cannot happen again,"" the petition said. ""Please protect the people from hate comments and criticisms that are spreading like a virus."" Goo's last Instagram post on Saturday evening showed her in bed with the caption, ""Good night"".  

 South Korea has one of the world's highest rates of suicide which, according to recent government figures, is among the top causes of death for those under 40. Taboos about mental illness also dissuade many South Koreans from seeking help. Goo's death comes a month after Sulli -- a fellow K-pop star and her close friend -- took her own life in October after a long struggle with online bullying. Beneath the glitz and glamour, the K-pop industry is known for its cut-throat competitiveness, lack of privacy, online bullying, and relentless public pressure to maintain a wholesome image at all times and at any cost. K-pop stars like Goo and Sulli are picked up by agencies at a young age -- usually in their early- or mid-teens -- and live under tight control, with their days taken over by gruelling singing and dancing training. Earlier this year Goo had spoken out about abusive comments, depression, and her difficult life as a celebrity. ""We have to be careful about every move we make in our lives and are suffering from a pain that we can't share even with our friends and family,"" said Goo, adding that anyone can struggle with depression. ""You all have freedom of expression, but can you please look back on yourself before posting a hate comment?"" she said. Fans mourned the star's death and lamented that she was unable to hear the voices of support. ""The stars appear to have a shining presence but they live with a pain that no one will understand,"" a fan wrote on Goo's Instagram account. ""How many more victims after Sulli and Goo will there have to be to understand that hate comments hurt others?"" the writer added. Another fan wrote: ""Maybe you couldn't hear the voices of love and support because the voices of hate were too loud. My heart aches.""

Jung Joon-young (centre) appeared at the court for a hearing hours earlier and said he had ""committed unforgivable crimes"". The singer-songwriter last week admitted to filming himself having sex and sharing the footage without his partners' consent. The videos of at least 10 women were shared through mobile chat rooms in 2015 with recipients including fellow K-pop star Seungri of Big Bang. The Seoul Central District Court issued the arrest warrant late Thursday, hours after Jung appeared at a hearing and apologised for committing ""unforgivable crimes"", the South's Yonhap news agency reported. ""I am sorry. I made a big and inexcusable mistake, and I admit my guilt,"" he said. ""I will live my days repenting for the sins."" Following the hearing, the 30-year-old was led away in handcuffs and taken to a police station to await the court's decision on the warrant. Jung announced his retirement from the entertainment industry last week and two other male singers have also quit after admitting they watched the illicit videos. South Korea has been battling a growing epidemic of so-called ""molka"", or spycam videos -- mostly of women, secretly filmed by men in schools, toilets and offices. ""Revenge porn"" -- videos taken of sexual relations without the partner's consent -- is believed to be equally widespread. Thousands of women protested in Seoul last year on several occasions against the videos as part of the country's growing #MeToo movement.",OVAA

											Facebook to use photo-matching to block repeat 'revenge porn'										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/tech/1227663/facebook-to-use-photo-matching-to-block-repeat-revenge-porn,"SAN FRANCISCO - Facebook Inc is adding tools on Wednesday to make it easier for users to report so-called ""revenge porn"" and to automatically prevent the images from being shared again once they have been banned, the company said. ""Revenge porn"" refers to the sharing of sexually explicit images on the internet, without the consent of the people depicted in the pictures, in order to extort or humiliate them. The practice disproportionately affects women, who are sometimes targeted by former partners. Facebook has been sued in the United States and elsewhere by people who said it should have done more to prevent the practice. The company in 2015 made clear that images ""shared in revenge"" were forbidden, and users have long had the ability to report posts as violating the terms of service. Beginning on Wednesday, users of the world's largest social network should see an option to report a picture as inappropriate specifically because it is a ""nude photo of me,"" Facebook said in a statement. The company also said it was launching an automated process to prevent the repeat sharing of banned images. Photo-matching software will keep the pictures off the core Facebook network as well as off its Instagram and Messenger services, it said. Users who share ""revenge porn"" may see their accounts disabled, the company said. Facing criticism, the company last year met representatives from more than 150 women's safety organisations and decided it needed to do more, Antigone Davis, global head of safety at Facebook, said in a phone interview. A specially trained group of Facebook employees will provide human review of each reported image, Davis said. The process to prevent repeat sharing requires Facebook to retain the banned pictures in a database, although the images are blurred and only a small number of employees have access to the database, the company said. Prosecutors and lawmakers have also sought ways to prevent the spread of ""revenge porn,"" seeking additional penalties for a practice that they said has ruined careers and families and even led to suicide.",OVAA

											Fury at Singapore's weak penalties for attacks on women										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/1973583/fury-at-singapores-weak-penalties-for-attacks-on-women,"SINGAPORE: Sexual harassment and assaults against women are not being taken seriously enough in Singapore, activists warn, after students at elite universities were given punishments criticised as too lenient for their crimes. In the most recent incident, a 23-year-old spent just 12 days behind bars after he tried to strangle his ex-girlfriend during a vicious assault. The city-state is known for its tough approach to law and order, with vandalism punishable by caning, while drug trafficking and murder carry the death penalty. But campaigners say crimes against women have long been minimalised -- marital rape was only criminalised this year. ""The justice system is very harsh on people who vandalise state-owned property. But you want to threaten and violate a woman's life? Oh yeah, sure. It's not as serious, is the message (authorities) are giving,"" said Pamela Ng, a spokeswoman for the Aim For Zero campaign against sexual violence. There are also concerns the academic potential of male perpetrators is being prioritised over the actual effect of sex crimes on women. This echoes criticisms of incidents at prestigious schools in the US, including the six-month imprisonment of Brock Turner for three counts of sexual assault, where a judge feared a longer sentence would severely ""impact"" the Stanford University swimmer. Last year, National University of Singapore (NUS) student Monica Baey took to social media to protest the light punishment given to a male student who filmed her in a dormitory shower. Her decision to go public was dubbed the city-state's #MeToo moment and is credited with encouraging other victims to come forward. But critics say recent cases involving men of privilege show not enough has changed. - 'Slap on the wrists' - In July, Yin Zi Qin, a dentistry student at NUS, was jailed for less than two weeks and asked to conduct 80 hours of community service despite pleading guilty to strangling his ex-girlfriend and pressing his thumb into her eye until she lost consciousness. The judge opted for softer ""community-based sentencing"" put forward by the prosecution as he was a first offender, cooperated with authorities, and voluntarily sought counselling and to apologise to the victim. But it provoked a public backlash with some angry the privileged only get a ""slap on the wrists"" for serious crimes. ""I can't believe the sentence is so light! I guess NUS students have such a bright future that they can get away with any crime,"" commented Maruko Chan on a social media post about the ruling. ""Because he's a medical student and a future doctor?... Go ahead do more of wrist slapping,"" said netizen Huew Lim. In another case, NUS student Terence Siow Kai Yuan was sentenced to 21 months of supervised probation for molesting a woman on a train and at a station. The judge rejected the prosecution's call for a custodial sentence saying he had a high chance of being rehabilitated given his academic record and ""relatively minor"" nature of his acts, according to court documents. However, his victim told The New Paper, the attack was not ""spur of the moment"" and the impact on her had not been minor. Siow was later jailed for two weeks after prosecutors appealed. Following the July case, women's rights group AWARE raised concerns that more consideration was being shown for the assailant than the impact on the victims. ""Rehabilitation is important but this should not depend on the educational status of the perpetrator,"" AWARE executive director Corinna Lim adds. - 'Sexual violence normalised' - Vanessa who runs Instagram account upand.out, which aims to empower youth, says the system must treat everyone equally. ""23-years-old = fully functioning adult. He is fully capable of higher thinking if he was accepted in one of our top university's most competitive courses. If SG is taking a more compassionate stance for crimes now, it should be reflected in every case,"" the 22-year-old, who gave only her first name, added. There were 56 cases of sexual misconduct involving students from six Singapore universities between 2015 and 2017, according to information Education Minister Ong Ye Kung provided to Parliament last May. NUS toughened penalties for sexual misconduct after the Baey case in 2019, and said Yin Zi Qin is suspended pending disciplinary proceedings. Despite the growing concerns, Singapore lawyer Gloria James-Civetta cautioned that the judiciary could only operate within the ""boundaries prescribed by legislators"". ""In some instances, the academic background of the offender may be indicative of the offender's possibilities for reform,"" she explained. Singapore has toughened some of its sex crime laws, with ""cyber-flashing"" -- sending unsolicited images of one's private parts -- and ""revenge porn"" recently outlawed. And public anger has forced government action -- Home Affairs and Law Minister K. Shanmugam has announced a review of how sentencing decisions are made in such cases. But campaigners warn it will take a shift in attitudes at every level for real change to happen. Ng says sexual violence has been ""normalised"" to such an extent that it shaped society's attitudes and responses to crime's against women. She added: ""It's inherited false beliefs that survivors are somehow responsible for the crimes against them and that somehow if you are Singapore-Chinese, male and educated, you are somehow less responsible or accountable for such violent crimes.""",OVAA

Peter Thiel, a Silicon Valley titan, acknowledged he helped fund litigation against Gawker, with whom he has feuded for years since it ""outed"" him as a homosexual	 Gawker filed for bankruptcy in June, seeking to sidestep a shutdown from a $140 million judgment for releasing a Hulk Hogan sex tape in a lawsuit bankrolled by Thiel. Monday evening in New York was the deadline for submitting offers to buy the company, with qualifying bidders to take part in an auction on Tuesday. In March, a US jury in Florida ordered that wrestling star Hogan be allowed to collect $140 million in total compensation after Gawker published a videotape of him having sex with a friend's wife. ""For my part, I am proud to have contributed financial support to his case,"" Thiel said in the editorial, referring to Hogan by his given name Terry Bollea. ""It is ridiculous to claim that journalism requires indiscriminate access to private people's sex lives."" Gawker founder Nick Denton early this month filed for personal bankruptcy protection in a bid to stop his assets from being seized because of the judgment. Denton has slammed what he called a ""personal vendetta"" and said in a memo to staff that it was ""disturbing to live in a world in which a billionaire can bully journalists because he didn't like the coverage."" While Gawker has come under fire for its no-holds-barred approach to celebrity coverage, the case also raised questions about whether powerful interests can use their resources to silence media for unfavorable coverage. The case drew heightened attention when Thiel, a Silicon Valley titan, acknowledged that he had helped fund the litigation and others against Gawker, with whom he has feuded for years since it ""outed"" him as a homosexual. A filing in federal bankruptcy court in New York lists Gawker assets in a range of $50 million to $100 million, and liabilities between $100 million and $500 million. German-born Thiel was a founder of the online payments firm PayPal, and served as its chief executive before it was sold to eBay. He was also an early investor in Facebook and has been active in venture investing in Silicon Valley. Thiel used the Times op-ed piece to lobby for support of the Intimate Privacy Protection Act, legislation under consideration in US Congress that he said would make it illegal to distribute explicit private images, sometimes called revenge porn, without the consent of the people involved. The act is nicknamed the ""Gawker Bill,"" according to Thiel. ""Since sensitive information can sometimes be publicly relevant, exercising judgment is always part of the journalist's profession,"" Thiel said. ""It's not for me to draw the line, but journalists should condemn those who willfully cross it."" Speculation regarding who may bid for Gawker has included US digital media company Ziff Davis, Vox Media, Penske Media, and Univision.",OVAA

Google said it would soon put up an online form that will allow ""revenge porn"" victims to make requests to remove these items from search queries	 The Internet search giant said it would soon put up an online form that will allow victims to make requests to remove these items from Google search queries. ""We've heard many troubling stories of 'revenge porn': an ex-partner seeking to publicly humiliate a person by posting private images of them, or hackers stealing and distributing images from victims' accounts,"" Google search vice president Amit Singhal said in a blog post. ""Some images even end up on 'sextortion' sites that force people to pay to have their images removed. Our philosophy has always been that search should reflect the whole web. But revenge porn images are intensely personal and emotionally damaging, and serve only to degrade the victims -- predominantly women."" Singhal said Google will ""honor requests from people to remove nude or sexually explicit images shared without their consent from Google search results."" He said it was ""a narrow and limited policy, similar to how we treat removal requests for other highly sensitive personal information, such as bank account numbers and signatures,"" that may surface in search results. ""We know this won't solve the problem of revenge porn -- we aren't able, of course, to remove these images from the websites themselves -- but we hope that honoring people's requests to remove such imagery from our search results can help."" Twitter implemented a similar policy earlier this year, banning ""intimate photos or videos that were taken or distributed without the subject's consent."" Reddit also moved to curb the posting of explicit images without consent of the people in them, after the online bulletin board was criticized for allowing the distribution of hacked nude pictures of Hollywood stars. Google is facing a legal dispute in Europe on a similar matter, after an EU panel ordered the US tech giant to honor requests from individuals to have links to information about them deleted from searches in certain circumstances, such as if the data is outdated or inaccurate.",OVAA

Twitter said on April 16, 2015 that it is cracking down on mean, hateful or menacing tweets that cross the red line from free speech into abuse Twitter is overhauling its safety policy and beefing up the team responsible for enforcing it, along with investing ""heavily"" in ways to detect and limit the reach of abusive content, general counsel Vijaya Gadde said in an column published by the Washington Post. ""We need to do a better job combating abuse without chilling or silencing speech,"" Gadde said. Twitter last month modified its rules to ban 'revenge porn' - the tweeting of intimate or revealing pictures or video of people without their permission. The San Francisco-based micro-blogging site is also taking steps to curtail the use of anonymously created Twitter accounts to intimidate or silence targeted people. ""We are changing our approach to this problem, in some ways that won't be readily apparent and in others that will be,"" Gadde said. Twitter has tripled the size of the team responsible for protecting users of the service, resulting in a five-fold increase in the speed of response to complaints, according to the general counsel. ""We are also overhauling our safety policies to give our teams a better framework from which to protect vulnerable users,"" Gadde said. Changes included expanding the definition of banned ""abuse"" to include indirect threats of violence. ""As some of our users have unfortunately experienced firsthand, certain types of abuse on our platform have gone unchecked because our policies and product have not appropriately recognized the scope and extent of harm inflicted by abusive behavior,"" Gadde said. ""Even when we have recognized that harassment is taking place, our response times have been inexcusably slow and the substance of our responses too meager. This is, to put it mildly, not good enough."" Facebook last month updated its ""community standards"" guidelines, giving users more clarity on acceptable posts relating to nudity, violence, hate speech and other contentious topics. Facebook-owned smartphone photo and video sharing service Instagram followed suit on Thursday with a similar overhaul of its rules about what is deemed unacceptable. ""It was time for a refresh; to streamline it and provide a better explanation,"" Instagram director of public policy Nicky Jackson Colaco told AFP, citing the services global growth since being acquired by Facebook three years ago in a deal valued at a billion dollars. ""We are setting expectations for what kinds of content we think are acceptable to share on Instagram and what could happen if you violated the policy."" Instagram boasts more than 300 million active users worldwide, while Facebook lays claim to about 1.38 billion active monthly users. Instagram guidelines ban nudity, along with threats, and hate speech. The new community guidelines state that ""sharing graphic images for sadistic pleasure or to glorify violence is never allowed."" Facebook's updated community doctrine states that the world's biggest social network will not allow a presence from groups advocating ""terrorist activity, organized criminal activity or promoting hate."" The moves come with Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and other social media struggling with defining acceptable content and freedom of expression, and with these services increasingly linked to radical extremism and violence. ""What we come back to is what we want our platform to be used for and what we don't want it to be used for,"" Jackson Colaco said, noting that Instagram was created in a 'post 9/11 world.' ""Instagram is not a place to support or praise terrorism, organized crime, or hate groups,"" the new community guidelines stated. ""We remove content that contains credible threats or hate speech, content that targets private individuals to degrade or shame them, personal information meant to blackmail or harass someone, and repeated unwanted messages.""",OVAA

In a 20-page document filed Wednesday in US District Court, prosecutors said Moore had agreed to plead guilty to two charges -- hacking a computer to gain information for personal gain and aggravated ID theft. He also agreed not to use a computer without a probation officer's permission, and to stay away from the several victims whose testimony had led to his indictment.

Her mother, Charlotte Laws, who doggedly pursued the case, appealed to victims via Twitter to testify at Moore's sentencing. Isanyoneup.com reportedly pulled as many as 350,000 visitors a day before it was shut down in April 2012 after it was anonymously bought out by BullyVille, a website that campaigns against online bullying.

(From L) Chinese actors Wang Baoqiang, Wu Jiang and Zhao Tao pose on May 17, 2013 during a photocall for the film ""Tian Zhu Ding"" (A Touch of Sin) presented in Competition at the 66th edition of the Cannes Film Festival in Cannes. Sex may be a turn-off for Hollywood audiences but violence is all over the big screen, as filmmakers seek to capture the youth market, industry figures said on Friday.	 With online porn readily available, sex scenes are no longer prized by producers who look to action sequences or special effects to fill the gap. ""The Paperboy"" in which Nicole Kidman played a woman sexually attracted to Death Row prisoners and the sex surrogate film ""The Sessions"" with Helen Hunt are examples of recent films with sex that flopped at the box office. Michael Lavey, of the Los Angeles-based sales agents Taylor & Dodge, told AFP the need to pull in younger audiences was driving an explosion of violence on our screens. ""I think that young kids are just immune to violence. It's video games, it's almost (as if) you've got to have some violence for them to go (to the cinema),"" he said. ""Directors could be more restrained (in their use of  violence) but the smart ones are going to do what people like me say works. If they're open to that feedback they're going to make money,"" he added. A number films screened at Cannes over the past 10 days -- including China's ""A Touch of Sin"" (Tian Zhu Ding) and Japan's ""Shield of Straw"" (Wara No Tate) -- have shocked audiences with their levels of violence. Mexican director Amat Escalante was forced on the defensive after his ultra-violent film ""Heli"" left many critics feeling queasy. Nicolas Winding Refn's ""Only God Forgives"" was equally blood-spattered with one critic describing it as a ""sickening pornography of violence"". Many at a press screening found the Bangkok-set revenge drama starring the bankable Ryan Gosling almost unwatchable. And even co-star Kristin Scott Thomas described it as ""hyper violent and quite disturbing"" adding ""this kind of film is really not my thing"". Edmee Cuttat, film critic for the Geneva Tribune daily, who has covered the festival for two decades, said she had witnessed an increase not in the level of violence but in the level of ""gratuitous violence"". She described ""Heli"" as ""appalling"" and said she was unable to watch ""Only God Forgives"" in which a man in one scene is pinned to an armchair with knives and then stabbed in the eye. ""What I don't like is gratuitous violence. I don't find it useful but perhaps the directors think it corresponds with the era,"" she said. Gratuitous violence would appear to have replaced gratuitous sex as a marketing tool. Sex scenes were once written into scripts ""no matter what the plot"", Vincent Bruzzese, president of the film division of market research company Ispos, was quoted as saying earlier this year by Britain's Sunday Times newspaper. But now producers tended to ask ""do we really need the sex? Can we fill the space with special effects instead and keep the family-friendly rating?"", he added. Indian director Dibakar Banerjee said he preferred films that used only violence essential to character and plot such as Martin Scorsese's ""Raging Bull"". ""That film is about a violent man who deals with everything in his life through one answer, one response. That violence is necessary. ""(But) sometimes filmmakers use violence as a way of showing off and attracting a kind of notoriety because that's the fastest way of getting written about,"" he said. In other cases, he added, it was just ""there for the lack of a better idea"". French-born Australian filmmaker Chantal Denoux urged directors to remember the power of what was not shown. ""It is a bit like sex. Sometimes it is completely important to see the violence, however sometimes now you have the feeling it is gratuitous,"" she said ""Hitchcock never shows anything but we are terrified.

											Get a grip on bullying										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/1938840/get-a-grip-on-bullying,"As a corporate employee, I feel privileged that I'm able to work from home for most of the week. While the nature of my job allows me and my small team to carry on as usual, many other kinds of work require the physical presence of staff in a place of business. But the more time I've spent at home, the more distressing news I've been seeing about harassment, abuse and domestic violence. Online abuse is a growing concern. In Japan, the number of people who called a government hotline to report online abuse exceeded 5,100 in the fiscal year ending in March, compared to slightly over 1,000 nine years ago, a recent report showed. With home-bound people spending even more time on social media, some of it for work purposes, we've been seeing more cases of intimidation and abuse in the virtual world. The conventional wisdom is that working from home should free people from exposure to toxic workplace behaviour. But the new normal approach has actually opened the door for other forms of harassment. Harassment and intimidation based on gender or race has taken the form of being excluded from virtual meetings or bullied over video calls. Such provocations would have been harder to carry out in an office where other people are present. During not-so-formal meetings and conversations online, the boundaries between work and private life are blurred, which can also create a climate for harassment. Working out of our kitchens and living rooms can lead people to let their guard down and be more informal, or in some cases, improper. A comment about what colleagues, clients or other contacts see in the background at our house can all too easily be followed by unsolicited remarks about a person's appearance or by an inappropriate joke. Some companies have postponed investigations into harassment cases due to the pandemic. This is definitely not an encouraging sign. Virtual communication also provides a degree of anonymity that can lead people to act in ways they would not in person. The result has been the rise of cyberbullying as a global phenomenon. In Japan, the severity of the problem was driven home by the recent death of Hana Kimura, a 22-year-old professional wrestler and reality-TV star. She posted self-harm images on Twitter shortly before taking her life, implying she had suffered from cyberbullying. Her case has drawn attention once more to the delicate balance of regulation versus free speech. The bullying culture in Japan is so pervasive that Covid-related school closures and telecommuting have given rise to jokes about the unexpected benefits of staying at home -- a reprieve from school and workplace bullying. But the bullies are still there, lurking behind their screens. While those who have been defamed online can ask telecom providers and website operators to voluntarily disclose anonymous attackers' IP addresses, names and street addresses, the fact is governments have struggled to come up with effective solutions. Early this month, regulations to protect workers in Japan from abusive bosses and colleagues took effect. Large companies now must combat so-called power harassment, which includes such acts as striking an employee with one's bare hands or an object. Firms are legally required to have strict policies against workplace bullying. They must train employees and have a contact point for reporting cases of abuse. Companies allowing egregious abuse to occur will be publicly named. But cyberbullying is harder to police and not solely a Japanese problem. Similar cases have been reported in South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand. South Korean legislators have been pushing a bill that proposes making anti-cyberbullying education compulsory in schools, and allowing the identification and prosecution of those who post malicious online content. Of course, laws cannot fix every problem we face. Better behaviour should start with improved education in schools about how to use the internet more effectively and ethically. There is also no quick fix for office harassment and bullying, but employers can put more effort into offering training and following up on complaints. Companies, meanwhile, need to send a strong anti-harassment message and get more people involved in rooting out misconduct, while staff must be encouraged to speak up when they spot inappropriate behaviour. Experts also recommend easier reporting mechanisms for employees. As company managers focus on returning to work as virus concerns ease, healthy employment conditions must be a firm priority. Among those, concerns about harassment can't be ignored.",OVAA

""A handwritten note that was pessimistic about her life was found on a living room table,"" Lee Yong-pyo, commissioner of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency, told reporters. Fans mourning Koo's death flocked to her funeral home on Monday, while her colleagues cancelled their schedules and relayed condolences. Koo, 28, was discovered at her home in southern Seoul by her maid at around 6pm on Sunday, Lee said. Better known as Hara in other parts of Asia, Koo had spoken out against cyberbullying.

											Browbeating bullies										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/1781299/browbeating-bullies,"I'm not a fan of any boy bands or girl groups from South Korea but I was shocked by the news of the death of Sulli that made big headlines in Thailand two weeks ago. I didn't know much about her before but the speculation that her sudden death was suicide and that cyberbullying may have been a contributing factor saddened me and made me curious to know what happened to her life. Sulli was a 25-year-old K-pop star who began acting professionally when at the age of 11 and made her singing debut with the famous girl group f(x) when she was 15. However, she left the band six years later to focus on her acting career, which saw her in a string of movies and TV series that earned her a New Star Award. In the middle of this year, she made her debut as a solo artist and launched a single album of her own. At a glance, Sulli seemed to be a young happy girl with a bright future in the South Korean entertainment world. But what she had to endure along the path as an entertainer was far from entertaining at all. In real life, she was a victim of what many have described as ""toxic fan culture"" where many stars are left defenceless while having to encounter hateful comments, malicious rumours and cyberbullying online. In the case of Sulli, some Korean critics have related her falling prey to such mean behaviour to her being an unconventional girl who dared to speak her mind and refused to conform with social norms in deeply conservative Korean society where celebrities are expected to be respectful and reserved. On the contrary, she was often seen to attract controversy with her dating, clothing choices and outspoken comments on feminism. At the height of her singing career five years ago, Sulli was caught having been in a relationship with her much older boyfriend and received many vicious comments and false rumours to the point where she reportedly suffered from stress-related pain and decided to take a break from the music industry. Their relationship ended three years later but the verbal violence against her online never stopped. Sulli then drew a bigger and longer round of heavy criticism when she posted on her Instagram pictures of herself wearing a shirt without a bra. Just recently, she insisted that going braless was one's freedom and she expressed her wish that people would discard their prejudices. Looking from the outside, Sulli seemed to be a defiant girl who didn't care much about the anonymous haters who kept insulting her on social media and spoke out strongly against it. But last year she revealed on a TV show that the online abuse had contributed to her panic disorder and social phobia that she had suffered since she was young. Sadly, not many knew that prior to her death, she was suffering from severe depression. In the wake of her death, many of her fans, friends and also celebrities have demanded a change in the anonymous comment culture on the Internet where users are allowed to leave comments without revealing their real names. Lawmakers in Korea are proposing a new bill, nicknamed ""Sulli's Law,"" with the aim to enforce strict rules against malicious comments under anonymous titles. No matter to the exact causes of her death, it feels awfully bad to see a young talented and beautiful woman mentally tormented because she was honest about her own views and thoughts. Her death is a wake-up call for her country to take cyberbullying more seriously. Cyberbullying has caused a big headache in many countries. Research has found that it can cause significant emotional and psychological distress to people from any age or walk of life. In Thailand, harsh comments are everywhere on social media, mostly targeting certain politicians and celebrities. I'm not worried about them at all as most are tough enough to ignore the remarks and, in many cases, ready to fight back. But my concern is on our young children who are growing with the cyber world and are naturally fragile to unkind words. I don't know what it takes to successfully stop cyberbullying even though there have been efforts by many parties concerned over the years to protect children from being bullied online. But I think that it's equally important to promote a new generation of netizens and implant in them a sense of respect from a young age. They should be taught to understand and accept each other's differences and show their disagreement in a reasonable manner. As long as they can learn to respect the differences of individuals, they would not easily harbour hatred towards others. Then, I believe they will grow up to be open-minded adults who will not cross the line to inflict pain on anyone. Patcharawalai Sanyanusin is a writer for Life section of the Bangkok Post.",OVAA

The 2019 laureate will be revealed at 11:00 am (0900 GMT) at the Nobel Institute in Oslo. If one is to trust online betting sites like Ladbrokes, the favourite is 16-year-old Greta Thunberg, who has already received Amnesty International's top honour and the Right Livelihood Award, sometimes dubbed the ""alternative Nobel"". In August last year, she began sitting alone in front of Sweden's parliament on Fridays with a sign reading ""School Strike for the Climate"".  In little more than a year, she has galvanised millions of young people around the world to take part in demonstrations to raise awareness for action on climate change. She made global headlines in late September when she lambasted world leaders at the UN climate summit in New York. ""How dare you? You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words,"" she thundered, holding back tears. - 'Time to wait' - But despite her impassioned wake-up calls, experts are sceptical she'll be honoured. ""Extremely unlikely,"" Henrik Urdal, director of the Peace Research Institute in Oslo (Prio), told AFP, citing her young age and a lack of consensus on how climate change relates to armed conflict. ""The only way I could see that happen is that she would be part of a shared prize like Malala,"" Urdal said, referring to Pakistani activist Malala Yousafzai, who shared the 2014 prize -- at age 17 -- with Indian children's rights activist Kailash Satyarthi. Late Thursday, Norwegian broadcaster NRK put little faith in the idea, reporting that while ""bookmakers bet on Greta Thunberg, the Nobel Committee won't"". NRK journalist Knut Magnus Berge also pointed out that even though her achievements are impressive, Greta is so young, ""the Committee has time to wait"".  Experts think a more likely candidate would be Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who made peace with bitter foe Eritrea. ""Abiy Ahmed would be a good candidate, as his tenure has had peace-inducing effects in the country and on the region,"" said Peter Wallensteen, professor of Peace and Conflict Research at Sweden's Uppsala University.  Predicting the winner is always a challenge since the Norwegian Nobel Committee never reveals the names of the nominees. All that is known is that a total of 301 individuals and organisations have been nominated this year. - 'Age of fake news' - Experts also suggest that the five-person committee could this year decide to focus on freedom of expression and information, at a time when such freedoms are under pressure in both democracies and authoritarian regimes. ""In the age of fake news and information overload... and the lack of transparency, the lack of accountability in many political processes, this is something that I would hope the committee would take very seriously and consider,"" Urdal said. Press organisations such as Reporters Without Borders (RSF) or the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) could then be possible winners. As the migration crisis continues to dominate the political agenda, the UN refugee agency UNHCR and its head Filippo Grandi, as well as the organisation SOS Mediterranee, are also seen as potential winners. Broadly considered a controversial long shot, US President Donald Trump has nonetheless been mentioned for his efforts to mend old wounds with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Last year, the award -- consisting of a gold medal, a diploma, and nine million Swedish kronor (around $912,000 or 828,000 euro) -- was given to two champions fighting sexual violence, Congolese gynaecologist Denis Mukwege and Yazidi activist Nadia Murad. On Thursday, the Swedish Academy in Stockholm gave the 2019 Nobel Literature Prize to Austrian author Peter Handke. The 2018 prize, which the Academy had postponed in the wake of a sexual harassment scandal, was awarded to Polish writer Olga Tokarczuk. The Economics Prize will wrap up the 2019 Nobel prize season on October 14.",OVAA

											Emergency hotline hit by teen prank callers										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/526035/emergency-hotline-hit-by-teen-prank-callers,"Deputy Public Health Minister Somsak Chunharas has appealed to parents in Ratchaburi to warn their children after the 1669 medical emergency hotline in the province was flooded with prank calls from teenagers. “Such acts are definitely unacceptable. This medical emergency hotline concerns ‘critical minutes of life’. Making prank calls could undermine the survival chances of people who really need [urgent medical services],” Dr Somsak said after inspecting the emergency communications centre at Ratchaburi Hospital. Dr Somsak said the centre had received about 100 phone calls a day from Thai and Myanmar people in this western province during the first few days of Songkran, a 50% increase from the same period last year.  But half of the calls were prank calls made mostly by local youngsters. The teenagers contacted the 1669 hotline mostly during the daytime. They called but did not speak, or pretended to ask for information about prepaid mobile phone packages from the centre operators.  Female staff also received several calls a night from male adults that were verbal sexual harassment. “I ask parents to give stern warnings to their offspring not to [call the hotline], and to help raise awareness about helping other fellow human beings in society,” Dr Somsak said.",OVAA

											Pandemic of abuse										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/1958095/pandemic-of-abuse,"Stay-at-home and lockdown measures have helped to contain the greatest public-health threat the world has seen in decades. But as Covid-19 receded in many countries, a new public-health crisis was emerging behind closed doors, with increased domestic violence against women and children. With people stuck at home and schools closed, it has become harder to tap the usual sources of support such as friends, extended family or professionals, leaving victims unable to seek and obtain help, say health professionals. Stress occurring during the pandemic and economic instability have also been catalysts that exacerbate the risk of violence, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Data compiled by the WHO showed that even in normal times, almost one in three women worldwide report experiencing physical and/or sexual violence by their partner or sexual violence by someone else in their lifetime. The UN Population Fund (UNFPA), meanwhile, estimated in May that if lockdowns continue for six months, an extra 31 million cases of gender-based violence could be expected globally. ""Often abused women and children are afraid to talk because of fear or shame. This 'window' to speak up and seek help is, during confinement, even more restricted,"" says Mariya Gabriel, the European Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth. ""As a matter of fact, in some countries, we have seen an increase in reports of domestic violence since the outbreak of Covid-19."" Najat Maalla M'jid, special representative of the UN Secretary-General for Violence against Children, shared the same view, adding that ""confinement measures and the disrupted provision of already limited child protection services exacerbated the vulnerability of children to various forms of violence"". CHILD VICTIMS Violence against children, according to the WHO, encompasses all forms of violence including abuse and neglect occurring to children under 18 years of age. It can be physical and/or emotional ill-treatment, sexual abuse, neglect, or other exploitation, which results in actual or potential harm to the child's health, survival and development. The health agency's Global Status Report on Preventing Violence Against Children 2020, released last month, shed light on the prevalence of violence against children. It estimated that 300 million children -- nearly three out of four worldwide -- aged two to four years old regularly suffer physical punishment and/or psychological violence at the hands of parents and caregivers. Moreover, one in five women and one in 13 men report having been sexually abused as a child (before age 17), while 120 million girls and young women under age 20 have suffered some form of forced sexual contact. Child maltreatment often leaves serious life-long consequences. Physically, maltreatment causes stress associated with disruption in early brain development. Extreme stress can impair the development of the nervous and immune systems. Maltreated children, when they enter adulthood, are at increased risk for behavioural, physical and mental health problems such as perpetrating or being a victim of violence, depression, smoking, high-risk sexual behaviours, unintended pregnancy, alcohol and drug abuse, according to the report. The abused person is also more likely to become an abuser once they grow up. Therefore, violence is often passed down from one generation to the next, perpetuating a vicious cycle. More alarmingly, the health agency also documented that every year, there are an estimated 40,150 homicides in children under 18 years of age, some of which are likely linked to maltreatment. The agency, however, said that a significant proportion of deaths due to child maltreatment are often incorrectly attributed to falls, burns, drowning and other causes. Even though causes of maltreatment vary, the report emphasises that it is important to emphasise that children are the victims and are never to blame. The report shows that characteristics of an individual child that may increase the likelihood of being maltreated include ""being either under four years old or an adolescent, being unwanted, having special needs, having abnormal physical features, having an intellectual disability or neurological disorder, and identifying as or being identified as LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender)"", among others. The economic costs of the lifetime consequences of violence against children are also severe: In the United States alone, the WHO estimated, the costs amount to US$228 billion per year. To tackle the problem head-on, it's necessary to break the cycle of violence to create positive multi-generational impacts, by preventing child maltreatment before it begins. This requires an approach involving multiple parties. Effective prevention approaches, according to the WHO, include supporting parents and teaching positive parenting skills and enhancing laws to prohibit violent punishment. The global community has made some progress in addressing the issue. The good news is that 89% of countries have multiple sectors responsible for addressing violence against children, while 80% reported having at least one national action plan to prevent violence against children. The less encouraging news is that only 47% of countries said these plans, laws and rules were being strongly enforced. There is also a need to develop a quality education to empower children, allowing them to acquire knowledge, skills and experiences that build resilience and reduce risk factors for violence. Further, a systemic shift in restrictive and harmful gender and social norms around child-rearing, child discipline and gender equality are required. Governments play a central role in this endeavour. To put an end to violence against children, the report suggests governments strengthen their legislative framework, having laws that prohibit all forms of violence against children, and ensure that they have agencies with a mandate and appropriate resources to coordinate action to end violence against children. The report also suggests governments prioritise data collection on key violence-related indicators and use these to set measurable targets in national action plans. ONLINE ABUSE School closures as part of government lockdown measures have affected some 1.5 billion children worldwide. With the closures, online communities have played an important part in maintaining learning, support and play for many children. However, an increase in harmful online behaviour including cyberbullying, risky online behaviour and sexual exploitation have also been identified. From Asia to Europe, cases of online child sexual abuse have soared as children spend more time online, making them more vulnerable to abusers as Covid-19 gave predators access to new groups of children who before the lockdown didn't spend as much time online. In Australia, police warned that ""insidious"" online predators were targeting new victims after a surge in coronavirus infections put Melbourne under partial lockdown. During the earlier lockdown, traffic to websites hosting online child sexual abuse content skyrocketed and such material posted to the dark web doubled, said the police. ""We suspect that offenders will use this second wave of Covid-19 as an opportunity to find more potential child victims, as young people spend an increasing amount of time online with limited adult supervision,"" Australian Federal Police Commander Jamie Strauss said. In Australia, child exploitation has been on the rise in recent years. Nearly 22,000 cases were reported between July 2019 and June 2020, up by almost 50% from a year ago, official figures show. Lockdowns have also led to the rise another insidious activity: bullying and cyberbullying. Even before the lockdown, the United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef) ranked bullying among the top concerns of children. The issue is widespread throughout the world, affecting a significant percentage of children as victims, perpetrators or bystanders. In a 2019 Unesco report, Behind the Numbers: Ending School Violence and Bullying, bullying is highlighted a major problem worldwide, with 32% of students aged 11 to 15 bullied by their peers at school at least once in the last month. In a poll conducted by Unicef in 2019, more than a third of young people in 30 countries report being a victim of online bullying. Cyberbullying, which involves the posting or sending of messages, pictures or videos, aimed at harassing, threatening or targeting another person. Although the prevalence of cyberbullying is low compared with other forms of school violence and bullying, it is an increasing problem and is on the rise during the pandemic. ""During the Covid-19 pandemic, and the related school closures, we have seen a rise in violence and hate online - and this includes bullying. Now, as schools begin to reopen, children are expressing their fears about going back to school,"" said Unesco director-general Audrey Azoulay. To prevent bullying, legislation is needed to safeguard the rights of children and underpin policies to prevent and respond to school violence and bullying, train and support teachers to prevent and respond to school violence and bullying. There is also a need to empower victims by providing information and support to children to enable them to speak up and seek help. ABUSE IN SPORT Sport is another area where child abuse has long been prevalent, but where victims have been afraid to speak out until recently. Young people, especially those who aspire to become high-performance athletes, spend as much of their time around coaches as they do with their families and are often targets of exploitation or worse. A Human Rights Watch (HRW) report published this month, which documented the experiences of more than 800 athletes in 50 sports, found that in Japan, child athletes often suffer physical and verbal abuse and sometimes sexual abuse during training. The report titled ""I Was Hit So Many Times I Can't Count"": Abuse of Child Athletes in Japan, exposed a toxic culture in Japanese sport, which involves the use of physical violence as a coaching technique. Such practices are seen as essential to achieving excellence in competition and in personal character. Many child athletes had been punched, kicked or experienced verbal abuse, while others reported being ordered to eat excessively, denied water or told to train even when injured. The ""tradition"" makes eradicating physical abuse in sport hard because coaches, parents and some players believe that there's value in physical abuse. Abusive coaching techniques documented in the report include, but are not limited to, hitting children with bats or bamboo kendo sticks, slapping children, and simulated drowning. In 2013, the Japanese Olympic Committee (JOC), promised to take steps to eradicate violence among its sports federations after an internal survey revealed more than 10% of its athletes had been victims of bullying or harassment. However, the watchdog said that not enough had been done since then and demanded organisations such as the Japan Sports Council and the JOC use the upcoming Olympics as a catalyst for change. The watchdog's national director, Kanae Doi, said that even though child abuse in sports today is a global problem, the organisation chose to focus on Japan for 2020 because the Olympics and Paralympics will be held in Japan. Young athletes are often afraid to report abuse largely because Japanese culture emphasises respecting elders, leaving violent coaches to continue their harassment, said Takuya Yamazaki, a sports lawyer who worked on the HRW report. But Japan is not unique in this domain. In South Korea, the story of Choi Suk-hyeon, a promising triathlete who committed suicide in June, also exposed the culture of malpractice in the country. The story broke when Choi's family released a diary and secret recordings in which the young triathlete documented years of physical and psychological abuse that she said she suffered at the hands of her team's coach, doctor and two senior teammates. The diaries and recordings have set off a firestorm of criticism about the corruption and abuse that critics say has long pervaded the South Korean sports community. South Korea has slowly emerged as a global sports powerhouse, with its athletes winning Olympic gold medals and other prizes. But recurring scandals have revealed widespread physical violence, sexual assault and other forms of abuse against athletes, many of whom are young, vulnerable and live away from their families during training.",PVAC
1,1,2020-01-20 04:31:00,An imbalance of power,https://www.bangkokpost.com/life/social-and-lifestyle/1839504/an-imbalance-of-power,"After K-pop singer Lalisa Manoban, better known as Lisa, of the famous girl group Blackpink visited MQQN Cafe in Bangkok, its owner thought everything she touched would turn to gold. He started posting photos of Lisa on the cafe's Facebook page, bragging that someone wanted to buy a sofa on which the sexy star sat, before saying he in fact wasn't satisfied with the price offered. Then he joked about selling other things Lisa used during her visit, such as a glass, a spoon, a napkin and even a toilet seat. Last month, fans of the K-pop singer expressed their fury as they thought the comments posted by the cafe owner were inappropriate and were considered cyberbullying and harassment. The fans attacked the cafe on Facebook and created a Twitter trend, #LowClassMQQNCafe, which was used worldwide. The owner decided to post his apology to Lisa's fans while also telling them to calm down and that he didn't harass Lisa at all. After his ignorance, the cafe's Facebook page received lots of criticism. He eventually accepted his guilt and apologised to Lisa and her fans. The cafe has reportedly shut down indefinitely since the incident. This is just the latest case of sexual harassment that happens in a patriarchal society where many people -- including the MQQN Cafe owner and his friends -- don't even realise their actions constitute sexual harassment. This happens in part because Thai men have grown up with the attitude that they can express their sexual desires openly, said Jaded Chouwilai, director of the Women and Men Progressive Movement Foundation (WMP). ""Men are allowed to go to prostitutes when they have sexual desires. They haven't been trained to restrain themselves from their sexual drives and it becomes a problem. As boys, they like to lift the skirts of girls and tease them. When they grow up, they like to tease and wolf-whistle pretty women, and think it is something normal,"" Jaded said. In terms of international law, Jaded said that sexual harassment is a significant issue. ""Sexual harassment starts with whistling, staring, leering and unwelcome verbal conduct. Some men have the misperception that if he keeps approaching a woman, she will like him. There are cases of men getting closer to women to make plans to rape them,"" he added. Lalisa Manoban, better known as Lisa, from K-pop band Blackpink. Photo © lalalalisa_m : Instagram With this kind of attitude, lots of Thai women have encountered sexual harassment. According to a 2017 survey of about 1,600 public-transportation passengers by the Safe Cities for Women Network, one in three people experience sexual harassment while on public transport. Women, who accounted for around 45% of respondents, were harassed the most. LGBTI was the next group, followed by men. The unwelcome conduct that victims experienced most was looking under skirts or staring at their breasts (18.8%). Touching, leaning and cornering victims took second place (15.4%). Next was whistling at victims (13.9%). And uninvited or unwanted flirting was fourth (13.1%). Unfortunately, only 28% of the sexually harassed reported it to the police, while 12% chose to ignore the situation and walked away. Since we live in a male-dominated society, sexual harassment is treated like it isn't a serious issue. It is a misdemeanour charge. Asst Prof Tanawut Wonganan from the Faculty of Law, Valaya Alongkorn Rajabhat University under Royal Patronage, mentioned the case of Lisa on his Facebook page. He posted the definition of sexual harassment provided by the Royal Institute Dictionary's Psychology Vocabulary, saying it means any actions including leering, unwelcome sexual statements or other harassment that troubles, annoys or causes psychogenic pain. Tanawut posted that sexual harassment has a misdemeanour charge according to an amendment to Section 397 of the criminal code. ""Any actions that tend to be sexual harassment shall be liable to imprisonment for not longer than one month or a fine not exceeding 10,000 baht, or both,"" he posted. When it comes to sexual harassment, unwelcome verbal conduct or an unwanted action can be interpreted several ways. Naiyana Supapung, director of the Teeranat Kanjanauksorn Foundation (TKF), which promotes gender equality, explained that sexual harassment cases are different from others. ""When looking at a criminal case, we focus on the intent of an attacker. In a sexual harassment case, we concentrate on what a person who is harassed thinks or how a victim feels. In one case, a female bus conductor wasn't comfortable that a bus driver liked to slap her butt and make a dirty joke about her body. He claimed he did that to other bus conductors and nobody complained. Yet what he felt didn't matter. What mattered was how the conductor felt,"" the TKF director explained. ""Sexual harassment is about a person who has power harassing someone who has a lower status. We don't see a male employee harassing a factory owner or a daughter of the owner."" Fighting sexual harassment isn't easy. When someone faces sexual harassment, what should she or he do? Jaded suggested that victims need to collect evidence. And it is difficult to file a lawsuit if a victim is harassed by unwanted staring or unwelcome verbal conduct. ""Many victims who were harassed by leering or inappropriate comments didn't complain. They think if it wasn't a touching case, it would be difficult to make a case because we need clear evidence. Yet anyone who needs legal advice can come to WMP,"" Jaded said. ""There are counselling services available at the Department of Mental Health Hotline, 1323, the Department of Social Development and Welfare, 1300, and organisations helping women,"" Naiyana suggested. And if a victim can express her feelings to harassers, she should do so. ""A confrontation in a public place such as a workplace can make a harasser feel embarrassed and stop harassing. A harasser keeps harassing a woman because he knows that she is afraid of speaking up or thinks it is something normal,"" Jaded said. Naiyana echoed the idea. ""A person who can speak up must have had experience of power gender imbalance for a while. Thirty years ago, I felt that guys had power above me. A victim must know what she can do and what consequences will occur afterward,"" said Naiyana. Improving the unbalanced power structure in a male-dominated society, both Naiyana and Jaded believe, should start at the family level. The idea that sexual harassment isn't something normal should be implanted early. ""Don't think harassment is a normal practice,"" Jaded concluded. ""Don't get used to sexual harassment. When men have harassment ideas, they think about sex. If we don't change this action, it will be more violent or lead to a rape. Our education is also a failure. In textbooks, we have images of women as housewives who behave conservatively. The education system oppresses women and LGBTI, especially in a patriarchal society. We should learn about gender equality, and every gender is entitled to equal respect.""",PVAC

											'Vile' UK paedophile receives 13 life sentences										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/1195113/vile-uk-paedophile-receives-13-life-sentences,"LONDON - A retired English teacher was jailed for at least 16 years on Wednesday for what the judge called an ""appalling catalogue"" of sex offences against children in Thailand and Britain. Mark Frost, aka Andrew Tracey: Groomed, then raped young Thai and British boys. Mark Frost, 70, also known as Andrew Tracey admitted 45 sex offences against nine children in Thailand between 2009 and 2012, and two British pupils in the 1990s. The offences including rape, sexual assault and inciting sexual activity with a child under 13. His victims were aged between 10 and 15. At England's Central Criminal Court in London, he was sentenced to serve 13 concurrent life sentences and will spend a minimum of 16 years in jail. His crimes were ""the most appalling catalogue of sexual abuse"", judge Mark Lucraft said. ""It is clear you have an obsession with sexually abusing young boys with evidence of planning and grooming. Your conduct towards each and every one of these victims is horrific and deeply disturbing."" He added Frost's offences were ""truly shocking"" and that he was someone who will continue to pose a risk to children. The court heard how Frost groomed Thai boys with cash and sweets - then raped them and encouraged them to engage in sex acts. ""The harrowing evidence presented by the prosecution in this case outlined the suffering that Mark Frost caused to his victims,"" said Ruona Iguyovwe, from the state's Crown Prosecution Service. ""Over many years, Frost repeatedly exploited vulnerable young victims, both in the UK and in Thailand, for his own sexual gratification. ""His offending has caused severe psychological harm to all of the children he abused, many of whom are now old enough to realise the enormity of what happened to them."" The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) urged other potential victims to come forward. ""Mark Frost's vile campaign of sickening child abuse spanned over quarter of a century in the UK and abroad, and today's sentence will likely see him spending the rest of his days behind bars,"" a spokesman said. ""Frost was a prolific and dangerous paedophile who worked as a teacher and Scout leader for decades. We hope that anyone who suffered can now find the courage to speak out.""",PVAC

											Police search German allotment garden in Madeleine McCann case										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/1958875/police-search-german-allotment-garden-in-madeleine-mccann-case,"BERLIN - Police are searching an allotment plot in the northern German city of Hanover in connection with the disappearance of British girl Madeleine McCann, prosecutors said Tuesday. Madeleine went missing from her family's holiday apartment in the Portuguese holiday resort of Praia da Luz on May 3, 2007, a few days before her fourth birthday, as her parents dined with friends at a nearby tapas bar.  Despite a huge international manhunt, no trace of her has been found, nor has anyone been charged over her disappearance.  ""I can confirm that the search is being carried out in connection with our investigations into the Maddie McCann case,"" Brunswick prosecutor Julia Meyer told AFP, when asked about the operation first reported by local Hannoversche Allgemeine newspaper. Police began searching the site in the early hours of Tuesday morning, clearing trees and using an excavator, the newspaper report said. Meyer gave no details of how the plot was connected to the case or what they were hoping to find. Police revealed in June that they were investigating a 43-year-old German man over the 2007 disappearance of three-year-old ""Maddie"", saying they believe he killed her. The suspect, who was not named by police but identified by German media as Christian B., lived in Hanover from 2007, according to the Hannoversche Allgemeine. - Previous convictions - Christian B. has a history of previous convictions including child sex offences and rape. He is currently serving a sentence for drug trafficking in Kiel. He has applied to be released early on probation after having completed two-thirds of the sentence, with a decision still pending.  A court in Brunswick had separately sentenced Christian B. to seven years in prison last December for an assault against a 72-year-old American tourist in 2005 -- in the same seaside village of Praia da Luz where Maddie went missing. But that sentence has not yet been finalised pending an appeal by the defendant's lawyers over extradition technicalities. - 'Concrete evidence' - According to police, the suspect lived in the Algarve region of Portugal between 1995 and 2007.  He made a living doing odd jobs in the area where Madeleine was taken, and also burgled hotel rooms and holiday flats. German prosecutors said in June they had ""concrete evidence"" that Madeleine is dead, despite British police continuing to treat her disappearance as a missing persons case. However, despite repeated appeals for information, prosecutors have no forensic evidence and have so far not filed any formal charges. In a recent TV appeal, investigators said they were looking for the owner of a Portuguese mobile phone number that Christian B. had called in May 2007. While living in Hanover, Christian B. received fines for forgery in 2010 and for theft in 2013, according to a report by German news agency DPA. He split his time between Germany and Portugal from 2013 to 2015, the report said, citing prosecutors in Hanover. At the end of 2012, he reportedly opened a small shop in Brunswick with his then girlfriend. After they split up, he continued to run the shop alone until he gave it up 18 months later, along with the adjacent apartment. Investigators have said Christian B. would only be questioned in connection with the Madeleine McCann case after the investigation is concluded, so that they could present him with the findings of the probe.",PVAC

Mae Sot police yesterday took Sarim, 28, to the forest behind a Muslim community in Mae Sot district to carry out the reenactment of the crime. The girl's naked dead body was found on Saturday with wounds consistent with her having being tied with rope. Sarim was arrested the same day with the case enraging the community in Mae Sot district, a border town opposite Myanmar with many residents from the country. Many furious locals formed a crowd at the police station on Saturday and extra officers were deployed yesterday to ensure the reenactment could go ahead without disturbance. Police said Sarim had confessed to inviting the girl for a walk with him while he was under the influence of illegal drugs. He said he took the girl into a nearby patch of woods where he carried out the assault. He said he had not intended to kill the victim but his efforts to stifle her screams had resulted in her death. Sarim told police he had panicked and hid the body in bushes nearby before fleeing the scene. According to police, the suspect had served an eight-year sentence in jail for rape and murder before moving to work in Thailand. Pol Maj Gen Parinya Wisitdakul, chief of Tak provincial police, said the arrest had occurred after locals tipped off his officers about the likely culprit.

6,6,2020-06-16 04:00:00,Fighting a shadow pandemic,https://www.bangkokpost.com/life/social-and-lifestyle/1935600/fighting-a-shadow-pandemic,"Working from home during the height of Covid-19 was hell on earth for Bella*, a mother of two. Her abusive and alcoholic husband, whom she had been married to for a decade, had begun to physically and sexually violate her more now that she was working from home. The abuse often took place in front of the children, who were trying to keep up with schoolwork through remote learning. The abuse had become so severe that after an unprovoked altercation in the bedroom -- which left Bella with a broken nose -- paramedics were called by  neighbours to resuscitate her after they had been alerted by the couple's nine-year-old son who had found her on the bathroom floor with her nightgown drenched in blood. After recovering from her injuries, Bella opted to return to her abusive husband instead of going to a social welfare shelter because she feared getting infected with Covid-19. Bella's case is just one among many which demonstrates the rise in domestic violence incidents amid the coronavirus outbreak. Sadly, this is taking place not only in Thailand but across the globe. As a result of this unfortunate phenomenon, the 10th Asia Pacific Conference on Reproductive and Sexual Health Rights recently organised a discussion on the topic of ""Sexual and gender-based violence during Covid-19 in Asia and the Pacific regions"". At the event, panellists from Fiji, Tonga, Cambodia and Thailand shared how violence against women and children -- already a prevalent social problem in their individual communities -- had doubled in terms of reported cases amid the pandemic. While stats regarding the surge in violence against women and children are still scarce, news reports support the belief that there has been a significant increase in domestic violence as a result of the pandemic. Moreover, reports also seem to suggest that there has been a reduction in the number of survivors seeking support due to a combination of lockdown measures and/or women not opting to avail of health services due to fear of infection. A specialist for the UN Women Fiji Multi-Country Office for Ending Violence Against Women and Girls Programme, Abigail Erikson, stated that recent statistics show that last year alone, 243 million women and girls between 15 to 49 worldwide were subjected to sexual and physical violence by their intimate partner. The Pacific island countries have some of the highest recorded rates of sexual and gender-based violence, with nearly two out of three (67%) women experiencing sexual or physical violence by their partner. The violence is recurrent and severe and impacts women, girls, children, families and local communities at large. Public health measures adopted to fight the pandemic such as physical distancing and lockdown, she added, have confined people within their homes and added fuel to the fire. ""There has been an increase in calls to the national helpline numbers with 50% of women reporting a correlation between violence and some Covid-19 containment measure,"" Erikson said. ""Meanwhile, service providers have also reported that sexual and gender-based violence survivors who were already receiving support services have been experiencing more severe and more frequent violence. ""If we do not address the central drivers of gender inequality, violence and discrimination, then we are not going to deliver on the sustainable development goals [SDGs]. The money, resources and the political will that need to be put into addressing this issue should be unveiled against the backdrop of the pandemic and galvanise governments and civil society to direct all their efforts and resources into addressing all forms of such practices. If this happens, it would be a positive outcome of the pandemic."" Matcha Phorn-In, an ethnic minority lesbian feminist and founder of Sangsan Anakot Yawachon Development Project in Thailand, which works with marginalised and vulnerable members of society, remarked that due to increased travel restrictions, lockdown and home-­quarantine measures caused by Covid-19, there has been a rise in cases of sexual, physical and mental abuse, and gender-based violence in families she works with. The human rights defender said marginalised communities were already residing in crisis-like situations even prior to the pandemic. She described how a countless number of girls and women face poverty, discrimination and violation based on their ethnicity, stateless status, gender or sexual orientation. Meanwhile, the LGBTI community is also scared to seek public healthcare and/or other government services because homophobia and sexual discrimination hugely impacts their access to services. When Covid-19 struck, marginalised communities were hit the hardest, according to the executive director of the non-profit organisation. They ran out of food and were out of a job before others. Adding further insult to injury for the stateless and undocumented migrant workers and refugees living in Thailand without ID cards was that government aid during the pandemic was not available to them. This heightened their vulnerabilities. Matcha has made calls for safe access to abortion for all women; comprehensive sexual education in schools; legalisation of sex work; and laws to protect the rights of migrant workers, stateless people, sex workers and the LGBTI community. ""We need to change the system which fundamentally oppresses women,"" she said. ""This pandemic cannot be used as an excuse to stall progress made against sexual and gender-based violence. We require more engagement of women at the policy-making level and our government must listen to their voices to ensure an effective response to sexual and gender-based violence. ""In a culture such as ours which normalises domestic violence, the current Covid-19 measures have created an environment where women and children can become victims of abuse at the hands of a spouse or guardian more frequently because of the circumstances they are in."" While Thailand has not kept any statistics on this matter, social agencies have seen a drastic increase, Matcha explained. ""At recent engagements agencies such as the OSCC -- One Stop Crisis Center, or Social Help Center -- reported that the cases of domestic violence had doubled compared to the same time last year, while the Samaritans Thailand, a hotline for suicide prevention, have gone on record to say that they have found a three-fold increase in the number of callers, most of whom expressed concern over financial matters brought on due to Covid-19."" As for Cambodia, Dr Chivorn Var, executive director of the Reproductive Health Association of Cambodia (RHAC), said that confinement is likely to increase risks of partner violence as well as reduce access to regular lifesaving sexual and gender-based violence services. He said schools and most businesses in Cambodia had closed due to Covid-19 although it was not mandatory to stay at home. ""In Cambodia, we have laws, policies and programmes of action related to sexual and gender-based violence. We have to improve their implementation at the ground level through intersectoral coordination at the national and sub-national level. There is also a need to increase resources for continuity of care and lifesaving support and collection of age-specific data on gender issues."" Meanwhile, Ofa-Ki-Levuka Guttenbeil-Likiliki, director of the Women and Children Crisis Centre (WCCC), said that in Tonga, over 80% of sexual violence incidents, including child sexual abuse as well as rape and incest, happen within homes. ""Twenty-five percent of Tongan women have experienced either physical or sexual violence. But the majority of the support and response services -- like legal aid, safe houses or shelter homes, counselling services, sexual and reproductive health services -- for survivors of sexual and gender-based violence are on the main island. Women and children living in the five outer Tongan islands do not have direct access to these services."" Matcha added that addressing domestic and gender-based violence at its root is a must because, for one, the situation has reached a crisis point, with Thailand still lagging behind when it comes to making any tangible progress. She believes one of the reasons why men in general feel entitled to physically and sexually abusing women and children in Thailand is because of the mindset they have developed that the consequences of their actions will not get them into trouble. ""Thailand is a male-dominated society. The fact that we don't have a female representative to actually push our cause, both prior to Covid-19 and even now, makes the situation more dire for victims of abuse, especially with the implementation of work from home and quarantine restrictions that have exacerbated an already bad situation. ""We need to have the media work harder on campaigning against domestic violence and to raise awareness about it as a form of gross injustice and as a criminal act."" *Not her real name",PVAC

Local police took the man into custody after he surrendered to Khan Dong police on Wednesday, following a complaint by the girl’s mother, 26. She alleged that her uncle, her mother's younger brother, had raped her young daughter, police said. The 43-year-old suspect allegedly admitted having raped the girl. He said he called her in to play at his house around 11am on Monday. He took her to his bedroom, stripped the girl and then raped her. He said she had cried out in pain until he stopped 10 minutes later.  He said he raped the girl because his wife of 10 years had left him. He was lonely and drank heavily.  When he saw the girl on Monday he became aroused and so called her into his house.  Thai media reported the girl ran crying and bleeding from the house to her grandmother, and told her what happened. The woman took her grandchild to hospital for an examination, which confirmed the girl had been sexually abused. The girl's mother then filed a complaint against her uncle. The suspect was taken for a crime re-enactment on Thursday. He has been charged with four counts -  sexually abusing a minor aged below 13, performing an obscene act on a girl aged below 15, taking a girl aged below 15 for an obscene act, and depriving a girl aged below 15 of parental care. The man was due in court later on Thursday, when police would apply to detain him for another 12 days,  and oppose bail. ",PVAC
8,8,2020-06-01 04:30:00,Culture of rape,https://www.bangkokpost.com/life/social-and-lifestyle/1927492/culture-of-rape,"A recent rape case in Mukdahan province shocked the entire nation when it was brought to light that two underage female students were raped by five teachers and two school alumni. While the case was devastating on its own, it was all the more enraging when some netizens showed outright support to the perpetrators and shifted blame to the young victims. A teacher is generally a respected profession in the country. Even more so in rural areas where they play a role in the school and community. Thais are taught to be grateful to teachers for providing them with knowledge. The Mukdahan case has shone an unwanted spotlight on an ugly side of this profession, which experts see as an abuse of the power structure and patriarchy in our institutions and society. During a recent online panel discussion on the problem of rape and power, it was reported that about 50% of hundreds of rape and sexual violence attacks are on victims aged 11-20 years old, and that the perpetrators in about 5-10% of cases are teachers. These statistics were based on cases of rape and sexual violence as reported in the news from 2013-2017. But, as panellists pointed out, these numbers are much lower than what's really happening in society. ""This is a structural problem,"" said Varaporn Chamsanit, from the Women Wellbeing programme. ""It's not just about a child being unfortunate and running into bad teachers. These incidents are repeated over and over. However, we never get to know how prevalent it is in reality as some just don't get publicised. Many cases ended with both sides agreeing to a settlement. The perpetrators paid their way out. Some also married the victims."" Jaded Chouwilai, director of the Women and Men Progressive Movement Foundation, said the authoritarian nature within the bureaucratic system is held above the power of students who don't really have a say in what they want. The structure in educational institutions also gives power to teachers, not students. With their status, teachers are likely to know influential people, especially within rural communities, including policemen, leaders and local politicians, leading to many cases ending in a settlement. ""And when anything bad happens, people would automatically view that teachers -- believed to be virtuous by default -- would never do such a thing. Then, some just turn to attacking young victims instead,"" said Jaded. Children are bound to listen to teachers. And as they spend a lot of time together, a chance that teachers may abuse their power is also increased. ""In a way, it's a power bestowed from culture itself, which views that we are indebted to teachers. We don't respect them because of their individual knowledge, performance or behaviour. We just do for the fact that they are teachers, without considering much else. This mindset doesn't just affect children, but also their parents and people within the community,"" said Varaporn. Both Jaded and Varaporn said this rape epidemic is related to the patriarchy. ""Thai culture gives more freedom to men when it comes to sex, and urges and coerces them to be experienced. They cheat, have mistresses and pay people for sex, and society sort of compromises that it's acceptable to do so. But women are controlled and taught not to be promiscuous,"" said Varaporn. Jaded added that rape incidents happen everywhere with shared factors, including the inability to restrain oneself and the tendency to exercise and abuse one's power. Alcohol also plays a role as a catalyst. Whenever a rape case is reported, fingers are often pointed at female victims. The way they dress, the time they choose to commute, and even the place they happen to be at have become reasons for people to conclude that the victims were asking for trouble. With the Mukdahan case, social media erupted when a post made by a fellow teacher cheered for the perpetrators and expressed concerns for their wives and family, while saying the students were ungrateful for making the rape public. ""If you don't want your children to be raped by teachers, then just get them homeschooled,"" stated the Facebook post. Varaporn said that for people to show support for rapists and condemn victims, it shows that they accept violence and, in turn, support rape. ""It's like they're joining the perpetrators in raping and hurting victims again,"" she said. Thicha Na Nakorn, adviser of the Foundation for Children, Youth and Family, said that she has met with the victims of the Mukdahan case. They, too, have been attacked by their own peers for humiliating the school in their decision to expose the teachers' crimes. Thicha wished to see the Minister of Education himself visit the victims and show admiration for their courage in bringing this story to light. This is to discourage the rapists' supporters, while ensuring society that justice will be served. In previous rape cases, Thicha said victim blaming was common, which then harms the victim's self-esteem. She said that it's crucial to empower victims as it also influences their fight to prosecute the perpetrators. ""Empowering can be about changing the goal that the victims aren't fighting only for themselves and their family. A victim in a past rape case has said that she must've been chosen by the higher power. She doesn't want to see this happening to others, which was why she chose to proceed with the case. This is an empowered mindset,"" said Thicha. ""The process of empowerment can change a person from surrendering to being brave. They have a choice whether to stop or to go on,"" she said. If the victims choose to fight, Thicha said that the social mechanism must not isolate them and must accommodate and protect them during the entire process. In her experience, she has seen both civil society organisations and state agencies co-operating to help these victims. ""If state agencies can view civil society organisations as allies, we can recognise our individual strengths and work together to help people,"" said Thicha. The three panellists called for the Ministry of Education to take this issue seriously. Some of their suggestions include for schools to change their evaluation system and allow students, parents and the community be the ones who evaluate their own teaching staff. Thicha said students should be taught and empowered about their own rights at the school. ""If children know and can think for themselves, no teacher would be able to make silly threats like not giving them points or failing them in class [to force them to do things],"" said Thicha. Education Minister Nataphol Teepsuwan responded to the rape case by establishing a centre to protect students who have been sexually violated, with Hotline 1579 available to help victims. Jaded questioned the practicality of this centre and the hotline, suggesting that this mechanism needs to be a neutral space and should involve members from civil society organisations and academics to prevent the perpetrators from being helped by their own people. The panellists also agreed that the centre is only fixing problems at the end. In a campaign on Change.org, over 8,000 people have requested the Ministry of Education to join the victims as complainant against the perpetrators to protect the welfare of students. The petition was supported by a network of 92 organisations that protect women and children in Thailand. The campaign also asks for severe disciplinary actions for those who are found guilty, and asks the ministry to come up with preventive measures and to educate teachers about child's protection and gender equality. The online petition has since been submitted to the Minister of Education.",PVAC

											Checks on teachers for past abuse										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/1924064/checks-on-teachers-for-past-abuse,"Education Minister Nataphol Teepsuwan on Monday ordered the Office of the Teacher Civil Service and Educational Personnel Commission (OTEPC) to make sure that no teachers or school executives who have been convicted of child sexual abuse offences are able to return to the profession in any capacity. The move follows a school gang rape case in Mukdahan's Muang district early this month. Five teachers at a school in the area were suspended after being charged in connection with the repeated sexual assault of a 14-year-old girl. Two school alumni were also accused of having taken part, and all are said to have taken video clips of the acts. Amporn Pinasa, the OTEPC secretary-general, said yesterday a survey by her office found that about 180 teachers and school executives have been convicted of child sexual abuse over the past three years and all had been suspended or sacked. Ms Amporn said these convicted teachers have already had their teaching licences revoked and would not be able to reapply for work at a school. Nevertheless, she said her office would make details of the offenders available on a nationally accessible database to ensure that there are no loopholes that these offenders can take advantage of to find work where children might be present. The OTEPC chief also said she had been asked to conduct a study into what drove these teachers to commit child sex abuse crimes as well introduce better screening across all areas of teacher procurement and training to make sure that no individuals with a propensity for this type of crime slip through the net in the future. Ms Amporn added that in her experience the best teachers were not always the most knowledgable but often the ones who care the most about the wellbeing of their students and her office would do its best to make sure that trainee teachers who exhibit these characteristics would be fast-tracked into positions in schools across the country. She added that making sure that schools are ""safe spaces for students"" must be a national priority going forward.",PVAC

											School sex abuse cases spark alarm										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/special-reports/1923208/school-sex-abuse-cases-spark-alarm,"The three child sexual abuses cases which have taken place this month are clearly a wake-up call for all stakeholders to come up with better prevention methods. The latest case, of repeated gang rape in Mukdahan's Muang district earlier this month, was the most disturbing. Thais were shocked to learn the seven suspects were five teachers and two alumni from a public school. They were charged with allegedly raping two student girls aged 14 and 16. According to the police, the suspects first assaulted the victims in March 2019 and carried on at least six times until March this year. Some of the attacks even took place inside the school premises. The suspects denied the charges and were released on bail of 200,000 baht each. Another child abuse case took place in Chumphon's Pathiu district. A 32-year-old music teacher was accused of raping a 12-year-old female student at a resort. The father of the girl lodged a complaint against the teacher who denied the allegation. Another child abuse case occurred in Buri Ram's Ban Dan district when a 39-year-old teacher was arrested on charges of performing obscene acts on a 12-year-old student. He has admitted groping, but denied having sex with her. These alleged child sexual cases have gained significant public attention, raised concerns about the lack of protection for children in schools and prompted calls on the authorities involved to reinforce their efforts to prevent sexual harassment in schools. The Bangkok Post talked to a variety of stakeholders including educators, child experts, policymakers, police and criminologists, asking them how the problem can be dealt with, particularly the school gang rape case in Mukdahan. RESPONSIVE SCHOOLS Chulalongkorn University's education expert Athapol Anunthavorasakul said the cases represent a failure to protect children and should serve as a strong wake-up call to society to protect children better. ""Schools must be safe havens for children and no child should suffer from any form of violence in schools. Teachers must be the ones who protect children in their care, not the ones who harm them,"" he said. Mr Athapol said the supportive comments made by colleagues of the suspects also show how nepotism comes first in the Thai school system, not teachers' professional ethics nor morality. ""These men were sexually exploiting their students and treated the school as a brothel for over a year, yet their superiors and colleagues thought nothing was wrong with it. ""It is impossible that nobody knew about it, but nepotism made other teachers turn the other way. Had it not been for the fierce anger from the public, these men might have been spared by the school's nepotism again,"" he said. Mr Athapol said although most Thai schools have a student affairs division to provide support to students outside the classroom, many lack accessible and child-sensitive complaint mechanisms for students who are sexually abused. ""Most students who are victims of sexual violence don't know who they can turn to. They are afraid their complaints may not be taken seriously and fear reprisals. They need someone or a channel they can trust,'' he said. Mr Athapol said confidential reporting channels should be established in all schools and staff and students alike must know how to use them. Schools should also have clear referral pathways to social welfare agencies and work with multidisciplinary teams to provide support to survivors of violence and abuse. Teachers and other school staff can play an important role in preventing sexual harassment before it takes place by observing children, watching for signs of violence, abuse and neglect and reporting it when they have concerns, he added. ""Teachers should make a list of students in their classes who are vulnerable and at greater risk of sexual abuse such as those come from broken homes or live with step-parents or a single parent. More importantly, they must dare to stand up for victims even if the abusers are school staff members or their co-workers,"" he said. According to the Office of Basic Education Commission's Student Protection Centre, 624 student sexual assault cases were reported to the centre over the past five years. Out of these, 76 cases were committed by teachers or school staff. ''I'm certain that the true number is larger since so much of the problem goes unreported,'' Mr Athapol said. The expert also warned schools not to focus on protecting girls as sexual assaults can happen to anyone. Boys and LGBT children can fall victim to sexual predators as well. ""Boys and LGBT children have many of the same feelings and reactions as other survivors of sexual assault, but they may also face some additional challenges because of social attitudes and stereotypes about men and masculinity,'' he said. Child rights advocate Ticha Na Nakorn has called on the Education Ministry to rehabilitate the education system by reforming the spirit of the profession. She was referring to the case of the school gang rape by five teachers in Mukdahan. ""I do not come out in public to attack this profession because there are still decent teachers about. The challenge is how to help these good teachers and whistleblowers protect children,"" said Ms Ticha. The Justice Ministry is mulling compensating the victims by 110,000 baht each, while child psychologists from the Ministry of Social Development and Human Security have provided counselling. The 16-year-old victim, who is also a witness in the case of the 14-year-old, has been placed in the care of a Justice Ministry facility in Mukdahan province. COMPLAINT CENTRES Education Minister Nataphol Teepsuwan said he has ordered a complaint centre set up at the ministry for students to report any sexual misconduct by their teachers. He also instructed provincial officers to probe the school's director for possible negligence. The five teachers among the accused were immediately suspended and their licences revoked, Mr Nataphol said. ""This is a serious offence and I will not tolerate it. School is a second home to students. If the place is unsafe because of a teacher's behaviour, I have to put an end to it,"" the minister said. ""Under my watch, there will be no more transfers to inactive posts,"" he added. ""Every offender will be immediately fired."" UNICEF STEPS IN Unicef has called on the Ministry of Education to consider a review of protection measures, monitoring mechanisms and response protocols. ""The review, in partnership with professional bodies such as the Teachers' Council of Thailand, can also help in strengthening the code of conduct for teachers and other education staff, further ensure these codes are effectively implemented, and appropriate sanctions applied,"" it said. Teacher training curricula and professional development opportunities should include training about the causes of school-related violence and abuse, prevention activities, referral and response frameworks and ethical conduct.",PVAC

Under the revised law, adults who have sex with under-16-year-olds will be prosecuted for child sexual abuse or rape regardless of any alleged consent. Previously, teenagers aged 13 or older were held to be legally capable of consenting to sex, resulting in controversial cases and critics saying that sex offenders were escaping without punishment due to the low benchmark. In 2017, a 42-year-old man was found not guilty of raping a then 15-year-old on the grounds she had consented, provoking outrage and calls for the age limit to be raised.

The three teachers are Wipoj Saensuk, Anupap Banjong and Yutthana Phuthanonnok, according to Pol Lt Col Preecha Krongyut, the inspector at Phueng Daet police station overseeing the case. Although the teachers have been accused of organising the gang rape and asked others to join in, they will not be charged with human trafficking, said Pol Lt Col Preecha. The 16-year-old victim, a student at the same school, is serving as a witness in the first gang rape case against a 14-year-old girl. The teenager said she had been raped by some of the suspects accused in the other case and the information she had provided corroborated that given by the first victim. As of now, the second reported victim has been placed into the custody of the ministry of Social Development and Human Security. Sirikarn Klongdee, the child psychologist caring for her said the girl was under an extreme amount of stress following her ordeal. She has been given sedatives and psychological counseling, said Ms Sirikarn, adding that while the girl does not come from a poor family, her parents are divorced. Both victims were reportedly raped on a number of occasions over a one-year period starting in March 2019. The alleged gang rape case sparked national outrage when the grandmother of the 14-year-old girl filed a criminal complaint last week. So far, police had pressed charges against five teachers and two male alumni. All have denied the charges against them and requested bail, which was granted. One of suspects, Anupap Banjong has reportedly gone to stay at his father's home in nearby Nakhon Phanom province. Local media followed him and interviewed Manit Promdee, 77, his uncle who was shocked at the allegations against his nephew. Mr Manit described his nephew as ""polite man who couldn't harm a soul"". The uncle also told local media that Mr Anupap had told him that he had joined a party where the suspects drank alcohol together and met the girls. He said his nephew denies, however, sexually assaulting them. Meanwhile, police investigators scoured four sites connected with the alleged crimes -- the school gym, the volleyball court, the teacher rooms and their private residences. Pol Lt Col Preecha said they had recovered used condoms and a number of empty liquor bottles. He said the police are prepared to take the victims and witnesses into protective custody in the event of witness intimidation. Somsak Thepsutin, Minister of Justice, said officials from the ministry were already accompanying the victims and witnesses for their security. Both victims are also eligible to receive 110,00 baht each -- 40,000 baht for medical treatment, 20,000 for mental anguish and 50,000 for punitive damages.",PVAC

											World standing by as children harmed by conflict: charity										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/1857489/world-standing-by-as-children-harmed-by-conflict-charity,"LONDON - Governments were on Thursday urged to do more to protect children from the effects of war and serious violence, after a new report suggested record numbers were living in a conflict zone. Save the Children said wars were becoming more dangerous for children, with youngsters facing an increased risk of death and injury, being recruited by armed groups or sexual abuse. ""It's staggering that the world stands by while children are targeted with impunity,"" the charity's chief executive Inger Ashing said in a statement to accompany the report. ""Since 2005, at least 95,000 children were recorded to have been killed or maimed, tens of thousands of children abducted, and millions of children denied access to education or health services after their hospitals were attacked."" Ashing warned that ""the destruction of children's lives"" will continue if nothing is done and those responsible for crimes are not brought to account. - Record numbers - The report said nearly one in six children around the world -- some 415 million children -- were living in a conflict zone in 2018, more than double the figure recorded in 1995. Incidents of ""grave violations"" against them had risen by  170 percent since 2010, the ""Stop the War on Children"" study found. African children were the worst affected, with 170 million living in war zones, although a higher proportion were hit in the Middle East, where almost one in three were surrounded by conflict.  The report also found record numbers of children being subjected to grave violations: killing and maiming; recruitment by armed forces; abduction; attacks on schools or hospitals; denial of humanitarian access; and rape and other forms of sexual violence. For individual countries, the situation was worst in Afghanistan followed by Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iraq and Mali. Different threats faced by boys and girls was analysed for the first time.  ""Girls are at far higher risk of sexual and other forms of gender-based violence, including child, early and forced marriage,"" the study found. ""Boys are much more likely to be exposed to killing and maiming, abductions and recruitment,"" it added. - Kidnapping, child soldiers - Victims from both genders recounted their experiences in the report, including Samira, a 15-year-old Yazidi girl from Iraq who is mother to a two-year-old child.  She was kidnapped with her mother and sisters in 2016, kept in captivity and sold to at least three people who beat and sexually assaulted her. She was then forced into marriage with an Islamic State fighter and gave birth, returning home while her child remained under the care of authorities in Syria.  ""I would prefer to stay in slavery and live in camps my whole life rather than leave my child,"" she was quoted as saying. ""I did not want to leave her to live without (her) mother or to live the life that I lived. I wanted to give her the rights that I have been denied as a child."" Another recounted how a young boy called Peter was recruited by an armed group in South Sudan before escaping to Uganda.  ""They gave us weapons for shooting,"" he said. ""They trained you how to load a gun, how to put in the bullet and release the trigger for the gun to shoot. ""My heart was happy when I arrived in Uganda,"" he added.  ""I saw schools and hospitals. I was excited and said, 'this is the place where you can at least study and get medication whenever you are sick'.""",PVAC

The 25-year-old was arrested at the high-security compound on Sunday a day after the alleged incident at the living quarters for local housekeeping staff. Police officer Yogesh Kumar told AFP preliminary medical tests confirmed the girl had been raped. The man was charged under child rape laws that carry the death penalty. The sprawling diplomatic compound is one of the most secure in Delhi, with multiple layers of manned and electronic security.  A US Embassy spokesperson in New Delhi said Friday that it was ""deeply disturbed"" by the allegations and it took ""prompt action"" including reporting the incident to the police and helping arrange medical assistance. ""We are cooperating with the Indian-led investigation. We extend our sympathy and full support to the child and her family,"" the spokesperson said in a statement. India is struggling to combat a growing number of sexual assault cases in the country. Violence against women in the South Asian nation has been under the international spotlight following the brutal gang-rape and murder of a Delhi student on a bus in 2012. Almost 34,000 rapes were reported in 2018, according to official data, with activists claiming the figure is just the tip of the iceberg. Experts said most child victims are known to their abusers, with their families frequently choosing not to report the crimes to authorities amid social taboos against speaking out.",PVAC

Men, women and children can all end up behind bars for committing criminal acts. Ignorance of the law is no excuse. Many jurists advocate that laws be reconsidered periodically to determine whether they are still applicable. Some turn into the Blue Laws of yore, still on the books but no longer enforced. Others get overturned. One More LieAmy Lloyd Arrow389ppAvailable at Asia Books and leading bookshops315 baht A case in point is the banning of alcohol in the US in 1920. So many people broke that law that it was finally rescinded 13 years later. Marijuana laws have similarly been criticised. The prevailing attitudes appear to be changing. Time will tell. Even with so many laws being revised, perpetrators of serious crimes like robbery, rape and murder still fill prisons. Devil worship, human trading and sacrifices are so horrific that they are played down by the media, their adherents labelled ""evil"". The citizenry is so irate at the blood lust of those arrested that they want to tear them apart. Yet what if the evil ones are children themselves? Do they deserve leniency? In One More Lie by Welsh writer Amy Lloyd, age is taken into consideration, but it's not just a tap on the wrist. Charlotte, who as a preteen is involved in the horrific murder of another child, gets a new identity, psychiatric counselling and a band around her ankle to monitor her movements. Finally, at the age of 28, she is deemed fit to re-enter society and gets a job in customer relations. She has not had any contact with Sean, her partner in crime, since the incident 17 years before. Heavy on psychology, the plot is about Charlotte trying to adjust to her newfound freedom, such as it is. A spanner is thrown in the works when Sean tries to re-establish contact. She refuses him. For her, it was a one-time thing. But it has branded her. Awake or asleep, she can think of nothing else. The action is set in Wales and Scotland. Lloyd doesn't look at the locals through rose-tinted glasses. They, the ones her protagonist meets at least, are rather short-tempered, rarely polite. One constable is a decent fellow, the other isn't. Her shrink writes to her, but doesn't give her patient her return address. The story has no ending as such. Charlotte does her job and has her memories. She wonders how Sean is doing, yet has no intention of ever meeting him again. Life goes on. Critics have praised One More Lie as superb, thought-provoking, well-worth reading, etc. I question whether you will enjoy perusing it in one sitting. This reviewer has read many books in one sitting, but this isn't one of them. Charlotte is more a sympathetic than a likeable character. Then again, their childhood crime can't be condoned. As Dostoevsky pointed out, laws are about crime and punishment. The criminal justice system specifies how much jail time be accorded for the felonies and misdemeanours committed. Defence lawyers plead mitigating circumstances to lessen the severity of the verdict. Prosecutors are determined to throw the book at the defendant. Elevator PitchLinwood BarclayHQ455ppAvailable at Asia Books and leading bookshops550 baht Which is where motive plays a major part. The defence will try to make it appear as if the defendant had compelling reasons. To the prosecutor, this will be irrelevant; the act speaks for itself. To be sure, motives do greatly vary. Having had abusive parents is a common one. This warps a child's concept of human relationships. Blind jealousy is another common motive, as an infuriated wife or husband learns their spouse has betrayed their marriage vows. Then there's the co-ed who killed and chopped up her classmate for coming on to her best friend's boyfriend. Or what of the gunman massacring a crowd, claiming he's a political activist? Vengeance is in a class of its own, because it applies to countries as well as individuals. Countries that have lost a war and, with it, possessions and/or territory, often look for an excuse to wage a new war to redress the balance. Individuals may harbour thoughts of vengeance for wrongs, real or imagined, done to them or their loved ones. Crime thriller novelists are particularly fond of this variety. US author Linwood Barclay has a go in Elevator Pitch. Set in Manhattan, it focuses on its ubiquitous skyscrapers, filled with offices and thousands upon thousands of people coming and going every day. In the The classic film The Towering Inferno a packed skyscraper catches fire. Not all survived. We don't even need fiction to imagine such scenarios; the 9/11 suicide attacks on the Twin Towers left around 3,000 dead. In Elevator Pitch the scrivener zeros in on the lifts; regardless of the floor button pressed, it shoots to the top, then plummets to the bottom, fatal to all aboard. A tragic, inexplicable accident. Or is it? When it happens again the next day, the media starts asking questions. The third such crash a day later shuts down the offices. A body is found with its hands cut off, delaying identification. Elevator inspectors and the NYPD find other means to reach the top. Sure enough, the gear had been sabotaged. Why? There's an intense investigation, a journalist at the forefront. It all adds up to not very much.",PVAC

During her schooling years, things didn't change much. She was victimised by teachers and professors, senior figures she had little power to bring to justice. The subservient Fai could hardly come to terms with her misfortune when she began working, as her bosses continued the vicious cycle of sexual abuse. Years of abuse made her numb, both to the physical and emotional pain, pushing her into depression. It was only when Fai became suicidal that she sought help. While the 30-something is still coming to terms with her past, she has found solace in volunteering her time to help counsel other rape victims. ""Fai's case is not an isolated one,"" said Varaporn Chamsanit, programme manager for the Women's Wellbeing and Gender Justice Programme, a women's movement network. Women's social welfare groups in Thailand confirm that the rate of physical and sexual violence against females of all ages has reached a pandemic level. ""We live in a male-dominated society in which sexual inequality causes men to believe that they have the right to suppress the fairer sex. There is, however, much more to it than meets the eye,"" Varaporn said. ""While laws will take time to amend, and society's attitudes even longer to iron out, we can collectively work to address all forms of violence against women by getting involved. We cannot sit idly any longer and say that it is not our problem.  ""It is not justifiable to say that you do not want to get involved because it is a marital or family dispute. It is because of such excuses that perpetrators get away with physical and sexual violence against women. ""If everyone is more emphatic toward women and girls in distress, I believe we can constructively work towards addressing this issue of national concern more productively."" Varaporn has for years worked to promote and protect the rights of Thai women and children. She said that rapists are often acquainted with their victims.  A 2013 UN study of 10,000 men in Asia and the Pacific found that 71% said they felt sexually entitled to violate women. Nearly half, 44%, said the motivation for rape stemmed from boredom, or was enacted as a form of entertainment or fun. Thirty-five percent said rape was used as a form of revenge. Seventeen percent mentioned alcohol and drugs as the motivator. ""The sexual culture in Thailand is one in which men are rarely taught to control and channel their sexual urges in the right manner. Women, on the other hand, are taught to refrain from sex until they are married and be subservient. This is why when a woman is raped, she feels an enormous sense of shame and defilement.   ""It is highly accepted for boys to explore their sexuality through the use of porn magazines, and the common practice of them losing their virginity to a prostitute is encouraged. People with money have an even wider selection of sexual outlets. ""This lenient attitude often gives our male-dominated society the impression that they are allowed to do whatever they please to satisfy their sexual drive."" The glorification of rape in Thai soap operas also sends the wrong signals to viewers, she said. Watching the hero force himself on a woman before they eventually fall in love should not be considered acceptable.  ""It is likely that viewers can become desensitised watching such content and go on to commit what is termed 'romantic rape'. Even though we do not have any statistics to prove this, we cannot rule out the influence television serials have on viewers."" When children and elderly women are raped, studies show the perpetrators are often male relatives or neighbours. While a child often does not report being raped due to fear of retribution, older women often shy away due to shame.    Varaporn said rapists can subdue their victims in non-physical ways. Some may feel entitled to do so because of their higher status in society, a senior position at work or financial dominance.   The ability to get away with rape empowers perpetrators to repeat the crime, she said. This is why society needs to seriously and objectively address the issue.   ""Despite the fact that it is the woman that is the victim, she is often blamed by both the police and media for leading the man on and bringing it on herself,"" said Varaporn.  ""This is one of a handful of reasons why rape has a stigma attached to it. It is imperative for everyone concerned with handling rape cases to understand the victim, who often feels shame and looks at herself as 'damaged property'. ""There is also a certain amount of privacy she is entitled to at this time, which is often overlooked, especially by the media. Sharing the intimate details of the rape to the police officer on duty is the most dreadful moment for victims. Some can insensitively tell the victim that it is useless to file a rape charge when she can't present evidence. This can add to the women's feelings of despondency and lack of self-worth.''   Varaporn said it is important to make the present generation more accountable for their behaviour, and to teach the younger generation to practice safe sex. ""The fabric of society has to be put under scrutiny,"" she said. ""Centuries-old practices have to addressed, and with introspection we can all work toward a solution. Public forums are equally important to explore ways by which to share knowledge on how to understand and constructively address the issue of rape at its roots. ""Schools and parents must also become more accountable in educating young men to respect women. A husband does not have the right to force sex on his wife, while the wife has the right to refuse sex. Mutual respect has to be instilled in our culture.""     Rape is not only a women's issue — men also need to get involved to jump-start change in society's mindset by becoming positive role models. Additionally, parents need to change their views on how to raise their sons to respect women.",PVAC

Poor farmers burn their fields since they can't afford any other method of weeding. Hill tribe people burn the common forest because it generates mushrooms after the first rains, which apparently earn them 2,000 baht a day at markets. The police are too poorly staffed to catch a few offenders and make examples of them, and the average northern villager is too poorly educated to understand the hazards of an environment made smoky from routine burning of organic rubbish. As for the poor officials, they just blame it all on the poor old people in Myanmar. The ''solution'' is to be rich enough to afford air-conditioning and air purifiers, since no one else seems willing or able to tackle the underlying causes. Matt Balmain With regard to the fine column from Voranai Vanijaka in last Sunday's Bangkok Post, ''Values face off'', I am not only amazed but also dumbfounded that in Thailand a young man with sexual urges is subtly advised through the O-Net exam to go and play football with his friends. It seems there is certainly a lack of understanding of the psychology and physiology of the young test takers. And, of course, a complete denial of the facts on the ground in a land where sex sells on every street corner and newsstand. Just look around, almost every Thai magazine on the stand is like soft porn. They shamelessly target teenagers and contain a healthy dose of risque gossip, nudity, vulgarity and profanity.You can find these magazines in every corner of high schools and universities. What values are we talking about? The O-Net test preparation team must be nuts, and I am pretty sure they must be disappointed with all the wrong answers. It is quite clear from their tweets that the students are having the last laugh. Dr Kuldeep NagiAssumption University, Bangkok I arrived at Suvarnabhumi airport after a twelve-hour flight from England. The immigration process was absolute chaos, with very long queues. I waited two hours in line before it was my turn. I have a problem with one leg, which means I should not stand for lengthy periods. After this experience at the airport I spent the next four days in my hotel, unable to walk any distance. I will certainly not return again to Thailand. Anthony Sneddon  I have noted in the past month the moaning and groaning of a few individuals over the immigration queues at Suvarnabhumi airport. All of my 15 or so arrivals and departures at Suvarnabhumi in the past two year have been swift, and I've usually not had to endure more than three minutes of processing. I would imagine that my experiences are representative of the majority of people. However, visitors and frequent travellers alike should always have tolerance and understanding when venturing to other countries and cultures. Everyone should realise that long queues can be a fact at any big international airport, and even at small ports of entry. I can state this with confidence as I am a former immigration officer myself at an overseas international airport terminal. Next time you take to the road or air, please remember the virtues of tolerance and understanding, or stay jai yen yen as we say in the Land of Smiles.

											Police search German allotment garden in Madeleine McCann case										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/1958875/police-search-german-allotment-garden-in-madeleine-mccann-case,"BERLIN - Police are searching an allotment plot in the northern German city of Hanover in connection with the disappearance of British girl Madeleine McCann, prosecutors said Tuesday. Madeleine went missing from her family's holiday apartment in the Portuguese holiday resort of Praia da Luz on May 3, 2007, a few days before her fourth birthday, as her parents dined with friends at a nearby tapas bar.  Despite a huge international manhunt, no trace of her has been found, nor has anyone been charged over her disappearance.  ""I can confirm that the search is being carried out in connection with our investigations into the Maddie McCann case,"" Brunswick prosecutor Julia Meyer told AFP, when asked about the operation first reported by local Hannoversche Allgemeine newspaper. Police began searching the site in the early hours of Tuesday morning, clearing trees and using an excavator, the newspaper report said. Meyer gave no details of how the plot was connected to the case or what they were hoping to find. Police revealed in June that they were investigating a 43-year-old German man over the 2007 disappearance of three-year-old ""Maddie"", saying they believe he killed her. The suspect, who was not named by police but identified by German media as Christian B., lived in Hanover from 2007, according to the Hannoversche Allgemeine. - Previous convictions - Christian B. has a history of previous convictions including child sex offences and rape. He is currently serving a sentence for drug trafficking in Kiel. He has applied to be released early on probation after having completed two-thirds of the sentence, with a decision still pending.  A court in Brunswick had separately sentenced Christian B. to seven years in prison last December for an assault against a 72-year-old American tourist in 2005 -- in the same seaside village of Praia da Luz where Maddie went missing. But that sentence has not yet been finalised pending an appeal by the defendant's lawyers over extradition technicalities. - 'Concrete evidence' - According to police, the suspect lived in the Algarve region of Portugal between 1995 and 2007.  He made a living doing odd jobs in the area where Madeleine was taken, and also burgled hotel rooms and holiday flats. German prosecutors said in June they had ""concrete evidence"" that Madeleine is dead, despite British police continuing to treat her disappearance as a missing persons case. However, despite repeated appeals for information, prosecutors have no forensic evidence and have so far not filed any formal charges. In a recent TV appeal, investigators said they were looking for the owner of a Portuguese mobile phone number that Christian B. had called in May 2007. While living in Hanover, Christian B. received fines for forgery in 2010 and for theft in 2013, according to a report by German news agency DPA. He split his time between Germany and Portugal from 2013 to 2015, the report said, citing prosecutors in Hanover. At the end of 2012, he reportedly opened a small shop in Brunswick with his then girlfriend. After they split up, he continued to run the shop alone until he gave it up 18 months later, along with the adjacent apartment. Investigators have said Christian B. would only be questioned in connection with the Madeleine McCann case after the investigation is concluded, so that they could present him with the findings of the probe.",PVAC

											Belgium reopens case with possible link to McCann suspect										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/1933240/belgium-reopens-case-with-possible-link-to-mccann-suspect,"BRUSSELS - Belgium reopened an investigation on Thursday into the 1996 murder of a German teenager because of a possible link with the man suspected of murdering British girl Madeleine McCann. Carola Titze, 16, was found dead and mutilated in July 1996 in the resort town of De Haan on the Belgian coast.  The public prosecutor's office in Bruges ""is indeed reopening the file relating to this murder"", a spokesman told AFP, without giving further details. At the time, Titze was on holiday with her parents and the investigation turned to a German suspect in his early 20s. The man had bragged to her about his criminal past, according to the Belgian media, but he was never found. Following the identification of the German suspect in the ""Maddie"" case, Paul Gevaert, the now retired investigator in charge of the Titze murder probe, said there was ""certainly a connection to be made"".  The suspect, named as 43-year-old ""Christian B."" by German media, has a history of sex offences, including child abuse and rape. ""The description fits,"" Gevaert told Belgian newspaper De Standaard. His investigation was closed unsolved in 2016.  McCann went missing from her family's holiday apartment in Portugal on May 3, 2007, a few days before her fourth birthday, as her parents dined with friends at a nearby tapas bar.  Her disappearance sparked one of the biggest searches of its kind in recent history and became a cause celebre in the British and world media. Last week, German police raised hopes that the case could finally be solved when they revealed they were investigating the new suspect. - Missing girls - According to German police, Christian B. lived in the Algarve in southern Portugal -- where McCann disappeared -- between 1995 and 2007. Currently held in solitary confinement at Kiel prison in the north of Germany, he is serving a jail term for drug trafficking. He has refused to speak about the McCann case, one of his lawyers told German television on Thursday. The possible link between the case of the missing British girl and the Titze investigation in Belgium is not the only one to be raised by investigators since the emergence of Christian B. as a suspect.  In Germany, a five-year-old girl named Inga from the town of Schoenebeck in Saxony-Anhalt in 2015 disappeared without a trace in the woods while on an outing with her family. And in Portugal, the stepfather of an eight-year-old girl who disappeared in 2004 has asked authorities to explore possible links.  Joana Cipriano disappeared in September 2004 in the village of Figueira, not far from Praia da Luz in the southern Algarve.  She has also never been found. In the Netherlands, investigators are taking a closer look at the unexplained disappearance in 1995 of Jair Soares, a seven-year-old Portuguese child.  The case was reopened in 2019, but now the Dutch police say they are ""closely monitoring"" investigations in Germany concerning Christian B., a spokesman told AFP in The Hague. Soares was last seen on August 4, 1995 on a beach just south of the Dutch capital.  mad-lf-jah-arp/jv ",PVAC

Madeleine, aged three, vanished from the family's holiday apartment in southern Portugal in 2007, sparking a huge investigation, global interest -- and a slew of theories about what might have happened to her. Detectives in Britain and Germany announced on Wednesday night that a 43-year-old German man with a history of child sex abuse was now a prime suspect.

The Daily Mail asked: ""Have they found man who took Maddie?""

""They have not given up hope of finding Madeleine alive, despite the length of time -- they've never given up that hope.  ""But they are realistic and they say that whatever the outcome of this appeal and the police work, they do need to know because they need to find peace."" - Unidentified suspect - Portuguese police closed their case in 2008 but London's Metropolitan Police, opened a separate missing persons inquiry in 2013, Operation Grange. On Wednesday, detectives told reporters the new suspect was identified in May 2017, after an appeal for information on the 10th anniversary of the little girl's disappearance. He was among more than 600 people previously identified as ""potentially significant"" but was not a suspect in the case then, the force said. Later that year the Met alerted their German counterparts, and police in Portugal were also contacted. The authorities in the southern Portuguese region of Faro confirmed on Wednesday evening they were working with UK and Germany police, including speaking to witnesses. Germany's federal criminal agency said the suspect is serving a ""long prison sentence"" for an unrelated matter and has previous convictions for child sexual abuse. Described as white with short blond hair in 2007, the man was about six feet (1.82 metres) tall, with a slim build. He regularly lived between 1995 and 2007 in the Algarve -- the same region as the Praia da Luz resort town the girl disappeared from -- and did occasional jobs in the area. ""There is information suggesting that he also earned his living by committing criminal offences, such as burglaries of hotel complexes and holiday flats, as well as trafficking in narcotic drugs,"" German police said. - 'Somebody knows something' - Police have released details and images of two vehicles the suspect was known to have used as well as two phone numbers linked to him. Officials believe he was living in one of the vehicles, a ""distinctive and slightly unusual"" VW camper van, at the time of Madeleine's disappearance. They say the registration of his other vehicle, a dark coloured Jaguar XJR 6 which bore a German plate from the city of Augsburg, was changed remotely the day after she vanished. Meanwhile, police add a mobile phone number belonging to the suspect held a 30-minute call in Praia da Luz around an hour before Madeleine was last seen. ""Somebody knows something,"" said Mark Cranwell, the UK's lead investigator, as he appealed for information. ""Some people will know the man we are describing today... I'm appealing to you directly."" The family's spokesman Mitchell echoed British police in calling the suspect's identification ""significant"". ""There has never been something as clear-cut as that from not just one, but indeed now three, police forces,"" he said. Unlike the British missing persons inquiry, Germany's lead investigator Christian Hoppe told ZDF television their probe had led police to suspect that the man had killed Madeleine.  Mitchell said the family wanted closure. ""They simply want to establish what happened to their daughter, to find out the truth and to bring whoever was responsible for her disappearance to justice,"" he said.",PVAC

											Protecting Asean's most vulnerable										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/1785419/protecting-aseans-most-vulnerable,"The risks are high for migrants who leave home in search of a better future for their families, but nothing can stem the tide of the exodus. The International Organisation for Migration (IOM) reports that the number of migrant workers in Thailand rose to 4.9 million in 2018, which includes around 3.9 million from Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam. Among these are an estimated 300,000-400,000 migrant children. This year marks the 30th anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). All Asean members have ratified the international treaty, which upholds children's rights to survival, protection, development, and social participation. Leaders at this weekend's 35th Asean Summit will adopt the Asean Declaration on the Rights of Children in the Context of Migration, according to the Ministry of Social Development and Human Security. As Bangkok gears up for the historic forum, experts are urging Thailand, as current chair of Asean, to curb child migration amid concerns over human trafficking. Premjai Vungsiriphisal, a senior researcher at Chulalongkorn University's Asian Research Centre for Migration, attributes the influx of migrant children from Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos to socio-economic deprivation. ""For example, the Rong Kluea border market in Sa Kaeo's Aranyaprathet district sees a large number of children doing jobs to support their families. From the Western perspective, child labour is unacceptable. However, the children must work to escape poverty. If authorities launch a new crackdown, what are these children going to do? There should be alternatives to law enforcement, such as raising awareness and providing development opportunities for kids,"" she told the Bangkok Post. Ms Premjai said migrant children in Thailand and other countries find doors through which they can escape poverty. ""Myanmar and Cambodia are developing rapidly, which creates a lot of [job] opportunities in urban areas. However, workers have to pay higher living expenses and compete with other job-seekers in cities. It is very difficult for children to find their feet. ""In Thailand, they earn higher incomes and have more opportunities, such as free education. Do you know that a lot of migrant children cross the border to go to our schools each day? If they have relatives here, they can stay with them overnight,"" she said. However, Ms Premjai warned that migrant children are at risk of being exploited. ""They can be forced into prostitution. Traffickers often lure these innocent girls into believing they will work in restaurants. In these cases, we can take legal action because they become victims of human trafficking. ""However, the problem is that some are willing to become sex workers. I interviewed 15-year-old migrant girls rescued from karaoke brothels a few years ago. When I questioned them, they said they knew what they had to do before starting the job. What should we do if it is their choice [to enter the sex trade]?"" she asked. Ms Premjai wants Thailand and other Asean countries to improve border controls in an effort to end human trafficking. ""Border checkpoints can screen and repatriate migrant children. However, there are other secret channels [for human trafficking]. If Asean joined hands to develop child welfare among its members, it would help reduce the number of illegal migrants in the region,"" she added. Meanwhile, Wanchai Roujanavong, chair of the Asean Commission on Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Women and Children, said verification of migrants remains a challenge. ""It is very difficult to screen them because they don't have identity cards. They can lie about their ages to get jobs. In some cases, they bribe local authorities to forge birth certificates for passport application,"" he said, citing the arrests of underaged migrant workers at massage parlours. Mr Wanchai also proposed that Asean members uphold a single standard for detention of illegal migrants and their children. ""Thailand has already changed its practice. Migrant children are now kept in separate shelters while awaiting repatriation,"" he said. Thientong Prasanpanich, director of Children and Youth System Development at the Ministry of Social Development and Human Security, said Thailand is beefing up cross-border collaboration with neighbouring countries. ""Although Asean members adopted the CRC, they implement policies and laws on child migration differently. Hence, it is difficult for home and host countries to work together. However, we are making progress this year. For instance, Myanmar is showing strong commitment to boosting coordination with us,"" she said. Ms Thientong admitted that Thailand is facing difficulty ensuring that all migrant children can access public services, especially education and health care. ""Thailand's education-for-all policy welcomes migrant children. However, illegal migrant parents fear that if they enrol their children in school, they will be prosecuted for sneaking into the country. Therefore, many kids remain out of school,"" she said. Last year, Thailand's IOM Mission estimated that more than 164,000 migrant children are enrolled in school, while around 200,000 get no formal education. ""Thais are entitled to the 30-baht health scheme because they pay tax. Migrant workers are required to purchase their own healthcare package, which covers their children,"" she said. When asked about other categories of children on the move, Ms Thientong said Thailand still has a reservation to Article 22 of the CRC relating to rights of child refugees and asylum seekers. ""We cannot remove the reservation because we don't have a law on the status of refugees."" However, Thailand's treatment of migrant children has improved since it adopted the CRC in 1992, she added.""The immigration law regards them as innocent even though their parents migrate to Thailand illegally.... The child protection act ensures protection for Thai and non-Thai children while the civil registration act offers registration of birth to anyone born in Thailand."" Ms Thientong reaffirmed the government's commitment to promoting all children's rights to public services. ""Migrant workers are a driving force of the bloc's economy. It is impossible to ignore their children's living conditions. Most importantly, we see them as citizens of Asean,"" she said.",PVAC

The Anti-Human Trafficking Network (ATN) called the DSI move ""unusual"" because it was the department which first recommended slapping human trafficking charges against Kampol Wirathepsuporn and Nipa Thiratrakulwattana, who allegedly owned the business and are now on the run. Thanakrit Jit-areerat, the justice minister's secretary, yesterday accepted the petition on Mr Somsak's behalf.

The crackdown took place following tip-offs by members of the public in August that a gang had lured boys and girls to sell sex so that its members could buy drugs, said Pol Maj Gen Worawat Watnakornbancha, chief of the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Division. Police said Narin Rob-rue was the leader of the gang. The other six suspects were Wayu Pasi, Sittichai Ektasang, Wissanu Montha, Tong (family name unknown), Thanongsak Suriyothai and Wasant Sae Tia. The suspects operated from a hotel near Hua Lamphong train station. “There were several groups of customers who were charged 300-500 baht per visit,” Pol Maj Gen Worawat said on Saturday. If the children refused to cooperate, they would be beaten or tortured with fire and blades. Fourteen boys and girls aged 10-16 fell victims to the gang, and the girlfriends of the suspects also sold sex, Pol Maj Gen Worawat said. Police first arrested Prinya Ruenpitak, who they said acted as a procurer, before seeking warrants for 13 others. The operation involved a lockdown of the venue and searches of six other locations during which mobile phones and bank passbooks were seized. “The suspects admitted to committing the crime for at least four months.

											PM urged to probe Victoria's Secret case										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/1760359/pm-urged-to-probe-victorias-secret-case,"Anti-human trafficking advocates are calling on Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha to look into a controversial decision to drop human trafficking charges against key suspects in last year's Victoria's Secret brothel crackdown. The Anti-Human Trafficking Network (ATN), a network consisting of 13 women’s rights and child protection organisations, yesterday submitted a petition to the PM urging him to order an investigation into the legality of the decision made by the director of the Department of Trafficking in Persons Litigation (DTPL). The prosecution has reversed its decision to have the suspects indicted on human trafficking charges since the lower court previously found the suspects guilty of procuring prostitutes illegally, said Chalirat Thimbut, a coordinator of the ATN, at a press conference called ahead of the petition’s submission. “However, the fact remains that on Jan 12, 2018, girls aged 18 and below were among the 113 Myanmar, Lao, Chinese and Thai nationals rescued from a massage parlour in the Rama IX area of Bangkok during a crackdown,” Ms Chalirat said. The investigation into the suspected human trafficking network was broken down into two cases, one for the suspects who worked at the massage parlour and the other for individuals who were believed to actually be the owners of the illegal business, including Kampol Wirathepsuporn and Nipa Thiratrakulwattana, who fled the country after the crackdown, she said. Former national police chief Somyot Poompanmoung last year admitted that he had borrowed “around 300 million baht” from Kampol, whom he described as a friend. Despite the prosecution dropping human trafficking charges, it has still upheld charges relating to money-laundering, Ms Chalirat added. The director of the Department of Special Investigation (DSI) had recommended the director of the DTPL to also indict the suspects on human trafficking charges. Subsequently, the DTPL director ordered a panel to be set up to consider the charges recommended by the DSI. After an investigation, the panel agreed with the DTPL’s recommendation to charge the suspects of human trafficking. However, after the suspects petitioned against the charges, the DTPL director later reversed the panel’s decision and dropped the human trafficking charges. That has raised questions over whether the decision was made solely by the DTPL director. The DTPL has insight about human trafficking at Victoria’s Secret because after a previous crackdown on the business, the agency had provided legal assistance to the rescued women and girls. Ronnasit Proeksayajiva, president of the Ronnasit Foundation and a member of the network, said that prior to the crackdown, the foundation had received a complaint from the parents of a girl forced into prostitution at the brothel, which prompted the foundation to send someone to confirm whether child prostitution was actually taking place. “The brothel offered services such as sex with virgin girls for which it charged customers as much as 100,000 baht as it was a ‘high demand service’,” Mr Ronnasit said. A check into the money trail led to a connection between the illegal business and the people believed to be the real owners, who have now managed to escape human trafficking charges, he said. If the government fails to take proper action against key suspects in this human trafficking case, Thailand will have to pay the price in the next US Trafficking in Persons Report (TIP), said Surapong Kongchantuek, a former member of the human rights committee of the Lawyers Council of Thailand.",PVAC

											Epstein accuser sues, prison guards 'asleep' when he died										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/1730239/epstein-accuser-sues-prison-guards-asleep-when-he-died,"NEW YORK - An alleged victim of pedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein sued for damages Wednesday as reports claimed his guards were asleep before the disgraced tycoon died from an apparent suicide in prison. Two employees of the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York failed to check on Epstein for three hours and then falsified prison logs to cover up their error, the New York Times reported. The staff members were meant to be inspecting Epstein's cell every 30 minutes but dozed off, several unnamed law enforcement and prison officials familiar with the matter told the newspaper. The revelations came a day after the warden of the high-security facility was temporarily reassigned and two guards put on administrative leave by the Bureau of Prisons, pending an investigation. Epstein, 66, was found dead in his cell on Saturday morning. The FBI and Justice Department are probing how he managed to apparently take his own life just weeks after an earlier reported suicide attempt. US newspapers reported that he had apparently been taken off suicide watch and left without a cellmate, against protocol, while the guards were working overtime due to major staff shortages at the jail. The multi-millionaire, who hobnobbed with numerous politicians and celebrities over the years, was awaiting trial charged with one count of sex trafficking of minors and one count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors. His death came a day after a court released documents in which one of his alleged victims said Epstein used her as a ""sex slave"" and that she was forced to have sex with well-known politicians and businessmen. Another woman, who says she was raped by Epstein as a teenager, sued his estate and former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell under a New York law that came into effect on Wednesday. - Lawsuit - Jennifer Araoz wrote a column in the New York Times saying she was filing a lawsuit under the Child Victims Act against Epstein, British-born socialite Maxwell and other accomplices. Maxwell's recent whereabouts had been unknown but Britain's Daily Mail newspaper reported Wednesday that she had been living in a mansion in Manchester-by-the-sea in Massachusetts. Araoz, now 32, filed the lawsuit in a state court in Manhattan, according to US media. The New York Post said the accomplices were three unidentified women. ""I'm angry he won't have to personally answer to me in the court of law. But my quest for justice is just getting started,"" she wrote in the New York Times. The new law extends the statute of limitations for victims of childhood sex abuse and is expected to trigger a wave of cases against Epstein and accused abusers in separate cases. Even though Epstein's death ended his criminal prosecution, US Attorney General Bill Barr has said prosecutors would pursue cases against anyone else involved in his alleged crimes. FBI agents raided Epstein's private Caribbean island on Little St. James in the US Virgin Islands on Monday. According to prosecutors he sexually exploited dozens of underage teens, some as young as 14, at his homes in Manhattan and Palm Beach, Florida, between 2002 and 2005. He denied the charges but faced up to 45 years in jail if found guilty. Epstein was convicted in Florida in 2008 of paying young girls for massages but served just 13 months in jail under a secret plea deal struck with the then state prosecutor.",PVAC

In the United States, state governors and the US president have the right to pardon prisoners or modify their sentences. Involving anyone under age 18 in commercial sex is considered sex trafficking under US federal law. But it is common for such minors to be charged with crimes such as prostitution, experts say. In the United States, as many as 1,000 children are arrested each year on charges of prostitution, according to Rights4Girls. Some 1.5 million people in the United States are victims of trafficking, mostly for sexual exploitation, according to anti-trafficking groups. Most sex-trafficking victims are children, they say. The campaign to free Brown, promoted as well by singer Rihanna, rapper Snoop Dogg and reality television star Kim Kardashian, comes amid a wave of new laws vacating convictions and expunging criminal records of child-trafficking victims. The measures are often referred to as safe-harbour laws.

Vu, whose name has been changed, knew trying to escape could mean being beaten or even killed by her pimp	 Filmed on a shaky camera phone, the successful rescue saved the Vietnamese teenagers from a brothel in China, where a huge surplus of males has fuelled the lucrative trade for brides and sex workers.  Bringing them home is dangerous work, pitting rescuers against vengeful husbands, pimps and organised trafficking networks who spin tens of millions of dollars selling women from poor Mekong countries.  ""No one wants their business to be broken,"" says a rescuer from Blue Dragon, a Hanoi-based non-profit. Blue Dragon has helped bring about 400 trafficked women and girls home from China since 2007. They are among tens of thousands trafficked into China from impoverished pockets of Vietnam, Cambodia, Myanmar and Laos.  They are tricked, lured or kidnapped and sold as wives and prostitutes across the border, some ending up deep inside the tightly-controlled Communist country.  Rescues are a complicated and all-consuming job, says the Blue Dragon rescuer whose identity has been concealed for safety reasons. The stress is constant and the phone buzzes around the clock.  ""But I couldn't walk away,"" the rescuer says. ""Imagine your child didn't come home at dinner time. What would you do?"" - 'Please help me' - Victims reach out via Chinese messaging services like WeChat and QQ or call the non-profit -- if they can get their hands on a phone.  ""I was trafficked to China please help me,"" reads one text. ""I'm praying for a miracle,"" says another.  But most girls -- especially sex workers -- are barred from contact with the outside world; an escaped girl means thousands of dollars lost for traffickers. With risks high, each rescue can take months to plan and execute.  One girl faked illness and checked into hospital where she called Blue Dragon rescuers, leading them to a remote corner of China where she had been trafficked as a bride.  Another who had been sold into a brothel secretly used customers' phones to contact rescuers before evading bouncers by escaping via a back door.  Blue Dragon helps to bring home up to eight people a month and gets one or two desperate pleas for help each day.   The organisation keeps photos and videos of successful missions -- weeping mothers reunited with daughters, teenaged girls grinning widely after being saved -- morale-boosting reminders of their work. ""If we don't get her out of there she's stuck, she's in slavery,"" said Michael Brosowski, the Australian founder of Blue Dragon, which also rescues and rehabilitates street kids, sexual abuse victims and other kids in crisis.  - 'Alive again' - Le Thi Vu knew trying to escape could mean being beaten or even killed by her pimp, who kept her in a brothel for four months in China's Guangxi province where she was forced to sleep with up to 12 men a day.  Traumatised and fearing pregnancy, she secretly bought a phone and got in touch with her family who connected with Blue Dragon.   She had no idea of her location and could not read the Chinese street signs outside, but Vu -- whose name has been changed -- found a phone number for a hotel across the street and relayed it. One morning two months later, the rescue unfolded.  She went into a hair salon next to the brothel with another Vietnamese woman and suddenly made a dash for the waiting car, praying not to get caught.  Within days the pair were back in Vietnam.  ""I felt like I had come back to life again, I was so happy to see my mother,"" said Vu, now 21 and training to be a spa technician.  Rescues have helped Blue Dragon prosecute 76 traffickers over the past five years in Vietnam, where the maximum sentence for selling people outside the country is 20 years. Vu's traffickers -- her friend and her friend's boyfriend -- were both jailed.   Nguyen Trang was saved last year, eight months into a forced marriage to a poor Chinese labourer in Hunan province. She slipped out of the house early one morning to meet a Blue Dragon contact, who guided her onto a bus bound for the border.  She was offered $2,100 not to testify against her trafficker -- a former boyfriend who sold her to brokers in China. But Trang, also using a pseudonym, refused and her ex was jailed in August for seven years. Today, the slight 20-year-old works in a Hanoi restaurant and has tried to put the dark chapter behind her.  ""In Hunan my spirit hurt... now I can live again,"" she says. ",PVAC

											Halting child trafficking remains tricky										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/1578266/halting-child-trafficking-remains-tricky,"One of the positive developments in Thailand in recent years has been the governmental commitment to eradicate human trafficking. It has been complemented by a spate of court cases against human traffickers, with some evident successes. Yet, there remains a challenging situation, particularly where children are the victims, compounded by the complexity of a transfrontier situation and the opacity of the vested interests behind the sex market. The country is now supported by an extensive policy and legal framework which provides the tools to take action. Thailand is a party to the main international treaty on the subject of human trafficking -- the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children, supplementing the UN Convention against Transnational Organised Crime (2000) (""Palermo Protocol""). This treaty defines ""trafficking in persons"" as comprising three elements; the criminal act (such as recruitment or transfer of a victim); the means used (such as coercion, deception or abuse of power); and the purpose based on exploitation (such as sexual exploitation and forced labour). In the case of child victims, however, it is not necessary to prove the second element (the means) and absolute protection is afforded to persons under 18 years old. Importantly, consent of the victim to the trafficking (whether adult or child) is immaterial, and the trafficker cannot use consent to rebut the claims of the victim. Furthermore, the Palermo Protocol calls for criminalisation of human trafficking, victim protection, safe repatriation, and prevention and cooperation measures, such as on border security. Implementation of this treaty in Thailand has been witnessed by the enactment of the Act on Prevention and Suppression of Trafficking in Persons (2008), with two subsequent amendments, most recently the Anti-Trafficking Act (2017). These laws follow the Palermo Protocol, while providing additions based on the Thai situation. In particular, the 2017 law spells out the notion of abuse of authority by bearing in mind the victim's physical and mental condition as well as educational level. Progressively, there has also been an increase in sanctions (fines, imprisonment and even the death penalty). In 2016, a law was also passed to lay down the procedures for dealing with human trafficking cases, with the establishment of court(s) to deal specifically with the crime of human trafficking, conferring more powers on the judges to undertake investigations (""inquisitorial role""), as well as expedited procedures targeting finalisation of cases in six months. These are supported by various national policies, most recently the human rights agenda adopted by the current administration, as well as the commitment to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. There is also a range of other laws that intersect with the anti-trafficking law, such as the Anti-Prostitution Act (1960) and the Criminal Code, remembering that the country is a party to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and its protocols. In cross-border cases, national immigration law comes into play. However, the immigration law stands astride the thin line between victim and wrongdoer; where a person crosses into Thailand without the proper papers and where it is unclear whether the person is a victim of human trafficking, such law might classify the person as an illegal immigrant, consequently leading to immigration detention. Nevertheless, there are now various Memoranda of Understanding between government and other agencies to shift victims of trafficking from the immigration authorities to the social welfare authorities and to house victims in the latter's shelters. A key challenge is how to identify the victims and how to ascertain their age, particularly to enable adequate protection to be accorded to children. While under the current national law and related procedure, the identification of the victim should be finalised within a week, this is hampered when it is not clear whether the person is under 18 years old. Should the age of the person be assessed through tests on the bones or teeth? Experiences from other regions, such as Europe, question the accuracy of tests based on bones/teeth, as there is a possible margin of error concerning the actual age of the person. What should not be forgotten is the need to consult the child, examine the background circumstances, and access the family to help confirm the age. In today's world, technology can also help, such as online communication with the country of origin and local communities. This is linked with situations where the victim claims to be over 18, when the reality may suggest otherwise. The interview process needs to be sensitive to the trauma already faced by the child and the pressures which may cause the child to be evasive, including over their real age, due to fear and apprehension. The environment facing the child may also inhibit the truth-seeking process: An interview at a police station hoping for quick results may be inappropriate if what the victim really needs is a comforting shelter to recover in before evidence-gathering begins. What if the person accused of exploiting a child claims that the latter had stated that they were over 18 and the accused believed them at the time of the incident, in addition to the fact that the person consented to the act of exploitation? The mere fact that a child claims that they are over 18 should not be definitive, and the presumption -- and benefit of the doubt -- should weigh in favour of the child. This is now the judicial position in other parts of the world; the accused is under strict liability to the child, irrespective of the latter's claim of being over 18 years old. Add to that the global position today that criminal responsibility arises in trafficking cases, irrespective of whether the victim consents to the act of exploitation.

											13-year-old lured into sex trade										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/1551590/13-year-old-lured-into-sex-trade,"CHON BURI: A young female suspect has been nabbed by police after she allegedly procured a 13-year-old girl to have sex with an elderly Japanese man in Pattaya resort town. Her arrest adds to a growing concern that the age of suspects in sex crimes is getting lower. At the age of 20, Phloiphan Mueangdit allegedly runs a sex trade, and procured the victim for the Japanese man, himself caught two days earlier at his condominium on Jomtien beach in Chon Buri's Bang Lamung district. Ms Phloiphan was detained after she was found on Wednesday by officers at a food shop in Soi Map Yai Lia 31 in the district. She was accused of luring an underage girl for a sex service, an act that will also implicate her in a human trafficking charge, according to investigators led by Pattaya police chief Pol Col Aphichai Kropphet. An initial investigation found another Thai male was also involved in the wrongdoing, police said. Police are making further probes so as to bring this male suspect to justice. On Monday, they nabbed Hiroyuki Nakashima at his room after finding the 71-year-old allegedly contacted Ms Phloiphan to send him an underage girl. Among items confiscated from his room were pornographic magazines, sex toys and a camera secretly installed on the ceiling. It is believed this was set up to record him having sex with the girl, police said. Earlier in June this year, a 17-year-old girl was arrested on a charge of providing a 14-year-old-girl to have sex with an Indian tourist in Pattaya while a teenage boy allegedly procured senior high-school students for six customers in Nakhon Sawan. In August, police nabbed a 19-year-old female for allegedly procuring a 15-year-old girl to provide sex services for a drug network in the northeastern province of Roi Et.",PVAC

											ACT speaks righteously										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/1505462/act-speaks-righteously,"Hats off to the Anti-Corruption Organisation of Thailand (ACT) for its combination request-rebuke over the country's two biggest cases of graft. This group quite properly took the National Anti-Corruption Commission to task. The NACC has fulfilled neither its duty to the constitution nor its obligation to the public. It has convinced everyone it is dragging its collective feet on the cases, on purpose. ACT is quite properly calling the NACC to act more responsibly. The two high-profile alleged corruption cases involve the current first Deputy Prime Minister, Gen Prawit Wongsuwon, and the former police chief, Pol Gen Somyot Poompunmuang. Gen Prawit has been officially ""under investigation"" over a collection of high-priced wristwatches and jewellery seen in his possession, and worth well over US$1 million. Pol Gen Somyot is directly tied up in a probe into a nasty case that involves child sex, sex trafficking and a loan of 300 million baht. The two cases aren't legally related. ACT linked them because they have other commonality. Both involve public figures of high visibility. Both spent their careers in public service, yet emerged as extremely well off. As ACT's every sentence of its Sunday criticism implied, it seems to the public as if the cases of Gen Prawit and Pol Gen Somyot involve figures too big to criticise, too important to indict.

											Indonesia orders recall of ""vulgar"" children's sex-education book										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/1202944/indonesia-orders-recall-of-vulgar-childrens-sex-education-book,"JAKARTA - Indonesia has ordered a publisher to withdraw a sex-education book for children, which addresses the subject of masturbation, for being too vulgar. The publisher of ""I Dare to Sleep Alone and I Learn to Control Myself"" apologised for causing any offence but said the book aimed to help parents teach children how to protect themselves from sexual harassment. The Education Ministry said the book, written by Fita Chakra, contained pornographic content and cited a depiction of a cartoon boy's thoughts as he hugs a bolster pillow when he can't sleep. It also includes a part where the boy finds a new game of putting his hand inside his trousers. ""The content of the book is not appropriate for children. It's too vulgar,"" the ministry said in a statement, adding the publisher must recall the book or face ""strict sanction"". Sex education in Indonesia, which has the world's largest Muslim population, is uncommon and casual conversations about sex are considered taboo. Awaluddin Tjalla, head of the ministry's centre of curriculum and books, also said the ministry was speaking to an association of publishers to urge it to take action against the publisher. He did not elaborate. The author was not immediately available for comment, but the publisher, Tiga Serangkai, said it had consulted psychologists as well as paediatricians when compiling the book. ""Our intention in launching the book was so that we can help parents explain to children about the importance of protecting themselves ... from people with ill-intention towards them,"" it said in a statement. The book also contained educational material on sexually transmitted diseases and ""basic knowledge that is important for a child to know from early age"", it said. On its Instagram account, Tiga Serangkai said: ""We understand that some in our society are not ready for sex education at an early age"", adding that those who had bought the book could return it and get a refund. The publisher said the book had been withdrawn since December, but that it had found copies still on sale in some online stores. Some Indonesians turned to social media to complain. An Instagram user with handler @revitatiaman said: ""I've seen a few pages of the book and I don't think there's any education in here. Only damaging a child's moral and brain."" ""It is better to soothe a kid who is learning to sleep by himself at night through reading or reciting a praying,"" said @pipijippie. ""For Muslims, it can be done by reading the Koran, not by introducing the kid to sexual activity.""",PVAC

											Poll: Half of female revellers groped during Songkran										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/922377/poll-half-of-female-revellers-groped-during-songkran,"Just over half of the women and young girls surveyed complained they had been sexually harrassed during past Thai New Year water festivals, it was revealed at the launch of a ""Happy Songkran"" safety campaign on Tuesday. The survey involved 1,793 people, aged 10-40, in Bangkok, Nakhon Pathom, Samut Prakan, Chiang Mai, Lampang, Amnat Charoen, Chumphon, Chon Buri and Khon Kaen, said Charee Srisawat, of the Women and Men Progressive Movement Foundation. It found that 51.9% of the respondents said they had been sexually harassed by drunken men taking part in Songkran celebrations, The big majority of the respondents, about 86%, said they disliked the sexual harassment and wanted  steps taken to stop it. The remaining 14% felt it was normal and that such behaviour was acceptable, said Ms Charee. The majority wanted wanted authorities to seriously enforce the law and address the problem during the festival. Booths could be set up at festival venues to receive public complaints of sexual harassment and safe areas could be designated, the activist said. She urged people to celebrate Songkran in a constructive way. The survey clearly showed that most women saw sexual harassment during the festival as unacceptable, Ms Charee said. Men should respect the rights of women regarding body touching. Ms Charee revealed the results of the survey during an activity on Tuesday organised by the foundation, the Metropolitan Police Bureau’s children and women welfare sub-division, and the Thai Health Promotion Foundation (ThaiHealth) to campaign for safety during the festival under the theme, ""Happy Songkran….no alcohol, no sexual harassment and no violence.’’ Punika Apirakkraisri, of Thammasat Unversity’s Lampang centre, said the poll showed the Songkran festival had became a platform for sexual harassment and that some people saw such acts as normal. She pointed to the 14% of respondents who said being groped was acceptable. A 24-year-old Bangkok woman said she had been sexually harassed by a group of male youths during the festival. They had thrown water at her and some of them put talcum powder on her face, and used this opportunity to touch her breasts and further down her body. She shouted for help and scolded her attackers. However, the youths clearly did not feel any guilt, the woman said.",PVAC

											US report calls out 'severe' curbs on human rights										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/605120/us-report-calls-out-evere-curbs-on-human-rights,"Thailand has seen ""severe"" restrictions on freedom of expression, assembly and the media since last year's military coup, while human rights problems persist in the Far South, the United States concluded in its annual human rights report released in Washington Thursday. In its compendium of reports about the human-rights situation during 2014 in countries around the world, the US State Department chronicles the sweeping changes imposed by the military, detailing the ""numerous decrees severely limiting civil liberties, including restrictions on freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, and freedom of the press"". The report states no outright opinions or judgements on the events that transpired last year. In fact, in introducing the report, Secretary of State John Kerry said it was not intended to be ""sanctimonious,"" as every country, including the United States, had room for improvement. ""We couldn't help but have humility when we have seen what we have seen in the last year in terms of racial discord and unrest. So we approach this with great self-awareness,"" he said. But in the preface to the report, Mr Kerry placed Thailand  alongside China, Egypt, Iran, Russia and Saudi Arabia as countries that  were stifling the development of civil society. ""The military overthrew a democratically elected government,  repealed the constitution, and severely limited civil liberties,"" he said. ""Subsequent efforts by the military government to rewrite the  country's constitution and recast its political intuitions raised  concerns about lack of inclusivity in the process."" The lengthy chapter on Thailand details the long list of curbs put in place since May 22 as well as rights concerns that remained unresolved under democratic governments. The report notes that, since the coup, 900 political leaders, academics and journalists have been temporarily detained. At the same time, the US noted the marked increase in lese majeste cases brought under Section 112 of the Criminal Code for defaming the monarchy. ""The interim constitution, promulgated on July 22, set the framework for the adoption of a new constitution but did not provide citizens the ability to change their government peacefully,"" the US writes. ""Instead, it established a process in which unelected individuals would serve as interim legislators and a separate appointed body would draft a new constitution."" Other human rights problems cited include ""arbitrary arrests and detention; poor, overcrowded, and unsanitary prison and detention facilities; insufficient protection for vulnerable populations, including refugees; violence and discrimination against women; sex tourism; sexual exploitation of children; trafficking in persons; discrimination against persons with disabilities, minorities, hill tribe members, and foreign migrant workers; child labour; and some limitations on worker rights."" US Secretary of State John Kerry departs after speaking at a briefing on the ""2014 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices"" at the State Department on June 25 in Washington. (AFP photo) A large percentage of the report was dedicated to the continuing strife in the three southernmost provinces. ""The most persistent human rights problems consisted of abuses by government security forces and local defence volunteers,"" the State Department wrote, calling out ""occasional excessive use of force by security forces, including police killing, torturing, and otherwise abusing criminal suspects, detainees, and prisoners"". Police and military abuses got special attention, with the report's authors citing specific cases of alleged torture, including the case of two Myanmar men accused of the murder and rape of two British backpackers on Koh Tao in September. ""Official impunity, however, continued to be a serious problem, especially in provinces where the 2005 Emergency Decree and the 2008 Internal Security Act (ISA) remained in effect,"" the report said, noting that insurgents in the south also ""continued to commit human rights abuses, including attacks on civilian targets"". State Department Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor writers spent considerable portions of their 2014 Thailand assessment on detention and arbitrary arrest of coup dissenters, as well as insurgency suspects in the South. ""After the coup, security forces detained hundreds of activists and in some instances withheld information about their safety for brief periods before announcing their whereabouts,"" the report states, singling out the case of Kittisak Soomsri at a teacher-training centre in Bangkok. He was held for six days before being named one of the ""men in black"" who allegedly initiated violent acts during the 2010 street protests. In the far South, ""emergency decree provisions make it very difficult to challenge a detention before a court"", the report concludes. ""Under the decree, detainees should have access to legal counsel, but in practice, there was no assurance of prompt access to counsel or family members, nor were there transparent safeguards against the mistreatment of detainees."" Furthermore, the US states, security forces are given blanket protection against prosecution for anything they do while on duty, military and police officials do not always provide suspects, particularly indigent ones, with free counsel as required by law, and the process for obtaining arrest warrants is flawed. ""The system for issuing arrest warrants was subject to misuse by police as well as a judicial tendency to approve automatically all requests for warrants,"" the State Department said.  ""The law provides for access to counsel for criminal detainees, but lawyers and human rights groups claimed police often conducted interrogations without providing access to an attorney,"" the report states, adding that when free counsel is provided it was on an ""intermittent, voluntary basis"" and ""of low quality"". The US also highlights numerous cases in which Thai police allegedly use torture to coerce confessions and took particular note of the near daily re-enactments suspects are forced to perform in front of media and the public. ""There were continued reports that security forces at times used excessive and lethal force against criminal suspects and committed or were connected to extrajudicial, arbitrary, and unlawful killings,"" the report said, noting that ""police, military, and other agencies killed 45 suspects during the arrest process"". ""The interim constitution protects 'all human dignity, rights, [and] liberties', but it does not specifically prohibit torture. Credible nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and legal entities continued to report that police and military officials occasionally tortured and beat suspects to obtain confessions, and newspapers continued to report numerous cases of citizens accusing police and other security officials of brutality."" Soldiers close skywalk near Bangkok Art Centre to prevent an anti-coup protest June 1. (Photo by Pattarapong Chatpattarasill) Two cases that drew special attention in that section of the report included the disappearance and suspected killing of ethnic Karen activist Porlajee ""Billy"" Rakchongcharoen and the 29-day detention and alleged torture of red-shirt leader Kritsuda Khunasen. It also highlighted the torture claims of two Myanmar nationals accused of killing two British tourists in September. They too were forced to re-enact their alleged murders. ""Although police regulations require that suspects 'confess' before re-enactments, police often obtained these 'confessions' by coercion, including physical assault. Human rights organisations criticised forced re-enactments because they violate the presumption of innocence and encourage violence against suspects."" Once criminal suspects pass through police stations, human rights problems continue, the US said in the report. ""Conditions in prisons and various detention centres -- including drug rehabilitation facilities and immigration detention centres -- remained poor and most were overcrowded. In some prisons sleeping accommodations were insufficient, the lack of medical care was a serious problem, and communicable diseases were widespread."" Finally, the report makes special note of the increase in prosecutions under the lese majeste law, noting ""international and domestic human rights organizations and academics expressed concern over the chilling effect on freedom of expression"". The US said it was listing human rights concerns even as nongovernmental organisations in Thailand have been impeded in their efforts to address them under the junta. ""NGOs that dealt with sensitive political matters, such as opposition to government-sponsored development projects or border matters, faced periodic harassment,"" the US said. ""Human rights workers focusing on violence in the southern provinces were particularly vulnerable to harassment and intimidation by government agents and militant groups. The government accorded very few NGOs tax-exempt status, which sometimes hampered their ability to secure adequate funding."" Thailand certainly was not alone in being criticised by the US report for human rights abuses, with China, Myanmar, Cuba and Iran targeted with more-pointed comments. The State Department report criticised Tehran for having the second-highest execution rate in the world and said proceedings often did not comply with constitutional protections. On Cuba, the department said that while Havana had largely eased travel restrictions in January, the government still denied passport requests for certain opposition figures, or harassed them upon their return to the country. The report criticised Myanmar, with which the United States has been working hard to improve relations, saying abuses of minority Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine State remained ""severely troubling"" despite a ""broader trend of progress since 2011"" in the country.",PVAC
41,41,2015-01-27 06:00:00,Permanent scars of violence,https://www.bangkokpost.com/life/social-and-lifestyle/460755/permanent-scars-of-violence,"It can be said that no one else in the world could ever love a child more than the parents. While that statement is usually true, on the flip side of the coin, it is often the child's own parents who inflict the greatest pain through acts of violence. After all, it always hurts more to be hurt by someone near and dear to you. The print advert for the 'End Violence Against Children' campaign. According to the Ministry of Public Health, in 2013, about 19,000 Thai children were victims of violence, 70% of which was sexual harassment. Among children under five, most violence was carried out by parents. Those numbers came from data collected from hospitals nationwide, meaning they only represent children who were treated in hospital. That's just the tip of the colossal iceberg — many other cases were left unreported. Another recent study also revealed that 50% of Thai children surveyed said they had experienced violent punishment by their parents, caretakers or teachers. Even sadder is the fact that many of those children believed it was their fault. Unicef and the Ministry of Social Development and Human Security recently kicked off the ""End Violence Against Children"" campaign to create awareness about the negative impacts of corporal punishment and other violent actions on children. ""Violence against children persists because it is often accepted by adults, and the children themselves, as part of life,"" said Bijaya Rajbhandari, representative for Unicef Thailand. ""It doesn't only harm the well-being of children, but also undermines the productivity and prosperity of the country as a whole."" According to Rajbhandari, most violence against children takes place behind closed doors, undetected and unreported. Many adults have seemingly logical explanations for their violence, unaware of the negative impact on the child. The definition of violence does not just include hitting someone. There are many other forms of violence: seeing parents fighting aggressively, verbal abuse, being neglected, or having to carry too much expectation. Like corporal punishment, these actions too can affect children's physical and mental health. Sirirath Chunnasart, child protection officer of Unicef Thailand, said many parents often say that they hit their children because they want to teach them a lesson. Scientific evidence confirms that it's the opposite. ""Naturally, when children are being physically punished, the fright activates the part of the brain responsible for the fight-or-flight response, not the frontal part which learns logic,"" she said. ""The child would only learn how to avoid being hit the next time."" For parents who argue that they have turned out well-adjusted only because they were spanked as children, Sirirath pointed out that such reasoning cannot be proven, and is therefore not a logical argument. ""Who knows? You might have turned out even better if you had never been physically punished,"" she said. Studies have shown that children who have suffered from violence have an increased risk of mental health disorders, depression, anxiety, self-harm and suicide. Violence also impairs the ability to learn and socialise and increases the chance of children engaging in risky sexual behaviours and becoming violent adults. Dr Panpimol Wipulakorn, deputy director-general, Department of Mental Health, cited a recent survey by the Ministry of Social Development and Human Security, which surveyed 30,000 children and 20,000 adults. All of them admitted violence had been a part of their upbringing, whether it was spanking, yelling, name calling, threatening or other mistreatments. ""To stop this problem, blaming the parents is not going to work, because by blaming them, we are also using a violence. The best way is to educate parents, teachers, caretakers, and society as a whole about the negative consequence of violence against children,"" she said. The End Violence Against Children campaign urges the public to stop all forms of violence and adopt a positive, disciplined approach to raising children. The campaign will be promoted through several channels such as TV commercials, nationwide roadshow activities and online. Visit www.endviolencethailand.org ",PVAC

											Schools should be a safe haven from discrimination										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/410361/schools-should-be-a-safe-haven-from-discrimination,"Millions of Thai public school students headed back to class last week, ideally, to a safe and nurturing learning environment. However, the reality for LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) students in Thailand is often far from ideal. School run: Almost a quarter of bullied pupils describe themselves as ‘depressed’. For many of these youngsters, returning to school means re-entering a world where dealing with the fear of being bullied and of verbal, physical and even sexual abuse, all too often overwhelms their ability to learn, leaving them vulnerable to long-term social problems and health risks. A study conducted by Plan International, Unesco and Mahidol University was released to coincide with yesterday’s International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia and contains disconcerting findings on the issue. In total, 31% of students who identified themselves as LGBT reported having experienced physical abuse, 29% were targets of verbal abuse and 24% said they faced sexual harassment because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. The study, the first of its kind in Thailand, collected data from more than 2,000 students from five provinces in four regions through a computerised, self-administered survey. A further 450 people, including students, teachers and school administrators shared insights through in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. Those surveyed spoke of being exposed to a range of abusive behaviours at school that fit the commonly accepted definition of bullying. This included abuse that was verbal (name-calling, both online and in person), physical (slapping and kicking), social (being excluded or ostracised) and sexual (unwanted touching) in nature. Many LGBT students said that even going to the toilet at school was an ordeal, since they were not accepted at washrooms designated for either sex. Those who didn’t identify with their biological sex expressed frustration at being prevented from wearing the uniforms and hairstyles to match their gender identity. According to the study, 7% of those bullied said they had attempted suicide in the past year, while 23% suffered from depression. Anxiety, low self-esteem, withdrawal and social isolation were some of the other toxic side effects of bullying on these young people. These psychological after effects pose other threats to their physical well-being. Victims of bullying are more susceptible to engaging in illegal drug use and unprotected sex, increasing their risk of exposure to HIV. Fear of further discrimination and abuse means they are often less likely to access potentially life-saving HIV and sexual and reproductive health services and information. Safeguards for young people and efforts to respond to this complex issue need to be increased. After interviewing administrators and teachers for the study, researchers found that most schools lack a general anti-bullying policy, let alone one that focuses on LGBT students. Bullies are often punished at the discretion of teachers. In some cases, victims said they were accused of inviting the bullying behaviour upon themselves. Change, however, appears to be within reach. During the course of the study and since its completion, teachers and school administrators expressed a wish to have access to learning materials that can help them respond more effectively to the needs of the LGBT community and improve their learning environment. Unesco and its partners responded to that call by launching lesson plans last week that can be used all year round to bring discussions on sexual and gender diversity into the classroom. Further work to build teacher capacity to address these issues is also under way through a strengthened partnership between Unesco and Plan Thailand, with support from the Netherlands Ministry of Education, Culture and Science and the Swedish International Development Agency. The idea is to promote a “whole-school approach” to tackling bullying, that aims to make all schools safe havens for learning. We need to raise awareness around this often ignored or discounted issue. To that end, Unesco Bangkok, UN Aids Asia and the Pacific, and regional youth networks Youth Voices Count and Youth Lead joined up last week for the first “School Rainbow” campaign. Chalk rainbows have been drawn in front of schools throughout Bangkok by students, teachers and school staff, as well as members of the community to show support to end discrimination and bullying targeting young LGBT people. It is hoped that the rainbows appearing throughout the city will serve as a symbol of respect for diversity, and also as a symbol of renewal for the system in which we educate our children.

											Our domestic violence shame won't go away										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/379524/our-domestic-violence-shame-won-t-go-away,"For most Thais, Monday was an emotionally tumultuous day because of the Preah Vihear ruling and the increasingly heated political situation that risks plunging the country into another round of violent conflict. After monitoring the news all day, the latent stress that kept me awake that night was not thinking about the Bangkok Post's front-page reports the next day on the Preah Vihear ruling or the escalation of mass protests. It was a piece of news tucked away on Page 5 under this headline: ""Mother-in-law confesses ordering Jakkrit's murder"". More precisely, the troubling question was what I - as a mother - would have done had I been in her shoes. That story involves the high-profile murder of national sports shooter Jakkrit Panichpatikum, a macho athlete who was notorious for his violent outbursts and wife-beating scandals. In mid-July, he was briefly put behind bars for a shooting spree at the family home. It was his own mother, Mrs Boonkid, who took Jakkrit's wife, Nitiwadee Pucharoenyos, to seek help from the police. He was subsequently charged with attempted murder, assault, illegal possession of firearms and committing violent acts. According to news reports at the time, his mother said Jakkrit beat up his wife, threatened her and their children at gunpoint, barred his wife from leaving the house, shot at her and one of the children, and used a stun gun on her. Mrs Boonkid said Jakkrit also suffered paranoia from use of narcotics. Obviously, the wife had been subjected to horrific domestic violence for years. And no one in the family could stop him. ""I couldn't stand it any more,"" she was quoted as saying in the Bangkok Post's Spectrum magazine. ""I told her to leave the house, but my son threatened to kill them all and everyone in the house if she left. That is why she stayed put."" Jakkrit was eventually released on bail after he publicly vowed to his family to turn over a new leaf. Obviously, that did not last long. He returned to the headlines when he charged his wife for opening his safe at the bank without his approval. Last month, he was gunned down by a motorcycle pillion rider. On Monday, his mother-in-law, 70-year-old Surang Duangjinda, turned herself in at a media-packed news event. She confessed to hiring the gunman to kill Jakkrit in order to protect her daughter from further abuses. What followed was an explosion of I-am-the-judge comments on social media vilifying both Mrs Surang and her daughter Dr Nitiwadee. Wife-beating is bad, they said, but murder is much worse. They also didn't believe that the mother-in-law acted alone without complicity from her daughter, thinking that the duo were after their sports hero's money despite the fact that Dr Nitiwadee is a rich woman from running her beauty clinic. They also dismissed Dr Nitiwadee's plea for society to pay heed to the problem of domestic violence which destroyed her family. If their hero was that bad, they argued, Dr Nitiwadee should have left him long ago. ""Why stay?"" they asked. Jakkrit's father, a former shooting sportsman, also told a TV programme that wife-beating is an ""ordinary matter"" in family life. He reportedly added that the couple couldn't have lasted for six years had they both not been ""sadists"". If anything, such comments echo the total lack of understanding of how chronic wife-beating paralyses the victims with helplessness and fear. They are also part of the blame-the-victim mindset which perpetuates all forms of sexual violence from rape and wife-beating to sexual harassment. At the news conference, a reporter asked Mrs Surang why she did what she did. ""When I saw my daughter got hurt, as a mother I felt much more pain inside,"" she replied. After six years of seeing her daughter being trapped in a helpless situation that only got worse, the assault which resulted in her daughter's miscarriage was the last straw. ""I'm an old woman. The main thing I want in my life is to see my daughter happy, my grandchildren too. Do you understand the feelings of a mother?"" she asked. There is one woman who does. It's Jakkrit's own mother, Mrs Boonkid. ""I understand how a mother feels, ""she said in her quiet grief. As long as wife-beating is still seen as an ""ordinary matter"" in family life as Jakkrit's father and many online commentators feel, women's grief from domestic violence will see no end.
