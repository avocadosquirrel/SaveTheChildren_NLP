											Facebook too big a platform to allow fake users										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/1303415/facebook-too-big-a-platform-to-allow-fake-users,"There's something in common between the amazing story of ""Nicole Mincey"", the pseudonymous Twitter user with 146,000 followers who was retweeted by US President Donald Trump and then disappeared overnight along with a few other online personae, and a recent prank by a Berliner frustrated with his inability to get Twitter to remove hate speech. The common element is the obvious solution to both problems, which rarely surfaces in discussions of trolling, fake news and cyberbullying. Social networks should be obliged to ban anonymous accounts. If they refuse to do so voluntarily, government regulators should force the issue. Nicole Mincey was apparently a fake African-American identity that helped sell Trump-related merchandise online. It was part of an enterprise supported by pro-Trump social media posts from several fake accounts representing people whose backgrounds, looks (illegally used stock photos, actually) and views might appeal to potential buyers. The whole scam blew up after the Trump retweet prompted the owner of the photo stock to look into the matter. But how many other pro-Trump and anti-Trump accounts on Twitter and Facebook are actually fake? How do we figure out which of the famous internet echo chambers are even real? The German story also involves a retweet by a top government official -- Justice Minister Heiko Maas. In a video Mr Maas tweeted this week, Shahak Shapira, an Israeli-born satirist and musician living in Berlin, explains that he tried to flag about 300 tweets violating Germany's hate speech laws to Twitter, but the few replies he received alleged that the posts didn't go against the platform's policy. Mr Shapira then traveled to Hamburg, where Twitter's German office is located, and spray-painted the tweets on the pavement in front of the office building. ""Jewish pigs,"" one said. ""If you hate Muslims, retweet,"" said another. The accounts that tweeted this used pseudonyms, of course. Germany has a recently-passed law obliging social networks to delete hate speech within 24 hours of it being reported. With the link to Mr Shapira's video, Mr Maas also tweeted a report from a government-funded study showing that Twitter only deletes 1% of hate-speech posts after they're reported by users, while Facebook erases 39% of such posts and YouTube 90%. All three platforms delete almost 100% of the posts after being contacted again via e-mail. ""#HeyTwitter, that's not enough!"" Mr Maas wrote. Both with Mincey and with the racist tweets in Germany, it took particularly persistent users to draw attention to spurious and offensive content. The networks, though they profess a willingness to fight fakes, cyberbullying and other abuses, aren't particularly proactive about it, and they have a plausible explanation: They cannot police their vast user bases, and they need a lot of help. But there's an easy answer to that defence. Neither ""Mincey"" nor most of the tweets Mr Shapira sprayed on the pavement in Hamburg would have been possible had Twitter required identifying information from users before creating accounts. The platform's anonymity -- its privacy policy specifically allows pseudonyms and multiple accounts -- gives bigots, swindlers and bullies a sense of impunity. It's not clear what else it does for users; after all, the accounts with the most followers -- those of public personalities and journalists -- are, as a rule, verified by Twitter. People don't attach much value to anonymous opinions. They may appreciate an account that specialises in a certain kind of content or even an interesting bot -- but what would be the harm in identifying their creators? Facebook, unlike Twitter, has a strict policy against multiple personal accounts and pseudonyms -- which it doesn't enforce. If an account has been reported as using a fake name or impersonating someone, it may require an image of a government-issued ID. But the company vehemently protests when people try to force it to identify users. A UK court case in 2013 is a great example. When the parents of an underage girl who had repeatedly used Facebook to hook up with men proposed the pre-identification of users, Facebook made a number of surprising statements. ""Facebook cannot proactively prevent an individual from registering and creating a Facebook account and profile,"" the company testified. ""It is simply not feasible to review over 1 billion profiles to locate a single user who may be lying about his or her name. No technical programme or mechanism exists to prevent an individual from lying about his or her identity and/or age."" All it could do, Facebook said, was shut down the girl's accounts -- the new ones she set up every time -- after the fact. The judge sided with Facebook. In reality, both Facebook and Twitter would be able to identify users if they wanted to. It would be enough for them to require a valid credit or debit card, the way one does in application stores or on Amazon. That way, all accounts linked to one card would be tied to their actual owner, and underage users' accounts would be tied to their parents' identities. This would immediately resolve the problems of fake names, anonymous bullies, troll armies and hate-speech law violations. There would still be cases of identity theft, but the platforms could easily alert a user if a new account attempted to use his or her card data. Such identification would hurt whistleblowers and opposition activists in oppressive regimes. But, for their own safety, those who want to hide their identities should stay off Facebook and Twitter, anyway: There's a greater chance that a hostile government or corporation will track them down there than on more secure, encrypted messaging platforms or on the Dark Web. There's plenty of anonymity to be had on the internet. There is, however, no reason the huge corporate platforms (which essentially trade in our personal information) should be allowed to get on a high horse as defenders of privacy. These platforms have as little to do with the internet's early ideals as today's Apple has with the company Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak launched in a garage in the 1970s. They should be regulated in the same way as a TV station or a newspaper, which always knows the authors of the information it publishes. The social platforms hold on desperately to anonymity because it's the basis for their inflated user numbers, which they sell to advertisers and the stock market. If they give it up -- in reality, not just on paper like Facebook -- competitors will spring up to offer it. They should face up to their responsibility and start caring whether their users are real -- and why they might not want to give their real names if they are.â€‰(Bloomberg View) Leonid Bershidsky is a Bloomberg View columnist."

											The flipside to 'Nott'										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/1133365/the-flipside-to-nott,"As social media becomes the bright shining tool for normal people to unearth irregularities and fight injustice, incidents of cyberbullying are lurking in the shadows and becoming an increasing cause for concern. Thailand is among the top countries in the world in terms of social media users. About 60% of the population or more than 40 million people are Facebook subscribers while more than 26 million are on YouTube. It is no exaggeration to say that there is no talk of the town, major scandal, or newsworthy opinion that do not find their underpinning on the new media platform. While their connectedness, easy access and massive reach have made social media, whether Facebook, YouTube, Twitter or Instagram, successful tools in empowering people and giving them a sense of social equalisation, the very same capabilities have given rise to a worrying trend toward hate speech, trolling and cyberbullying. An example can be found in the latest case of a TV talk show host who became the subject of nationwide condemnation overnight after a video clip, which showed him repeatedly punching a motorcyclist and telling him to prostrate to his car, went viral last week. Akanat ""Nott"" Ariyaritwikul, 28, was filmed as he accused the motorcycle driver of hitting the tail light of his car, a Mini Cooper that costs more than two million baht, and trying to flee the scene. In an apparent rage, the celebrity not only punched the motorcyclist in the face a few times but also told him to kraab rot ku, or get down on the ground and pay respect to the car. The incident took place last Friday and the two men settled their conflict on the same day, according to police. It was after the video clip showing Akanat's violent outburst and demeaning demands later became available online that a public furore erupted. The backlash against Akanat, not so much for his resorting to violence to settle the conflict over what appeared to be a minor accident, than his seemingly mean-spirited demand for the man to pay respect to his car, was so strong that his employer GMMTV decided to terminate his contract. Thai PBS suspended the airing of the programme Thailand Science Challenge, which Akanat hosts. An organisation which gave him a role model award in September asked that the accolade be returned as well. But these are not all the punishments. In venting their anger, ten of thousands of Facebook users left messages criticising the TV talk show host not only on his account but wherever his photos appeared. Some took to lambasting his parents. Many also reportedly harassed a restaurant where Akanat is an investment partner and campaigned for people to stop patronising the place. It is ironic that people who denounced Akanat's violent behaviour would post messages threatening not just the talk show host but his family and those associated with him on online and social media forums. Many publicly urged people to boycott the celebrity until he has no place left in society. This form of social sanction is obviously going too far. Following the public uproar, Akanat was faced with a new police complaint for physical assault by the injured motorcyclist who received hit-and-run complaint in return. The case is in the hands of police who have promised to handle it with speed and care. The cyberbullying must stop. The kraab rot ku scandal has reinforced the belief that social media sanctions work effectively in setting the record straight when it comes to improper behaviour. The unwelcome byproducts of trolling and cyberbullying, however, must be curtailed before they spiral completely out of control."

											Twitter moves to stem violent threats, abuse										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/tech/536267/twitter-moves-to-stem-violent-threats-abuse,"WASHINGTON - Twitter on Tuesday began implementing a new policy aimed at curbing use of the social network to incite violence, and to crack down on abuse and harassment on the service. Twitter began implementing a newÂ policy aimed at curbing use of the network to incite violence, and to crack down on abuse and harassment	 The new rules are the latest implemented by social networks aiming to stem violence and harassment while attempting to safeguard freedom of online speech. ""We need to ensure that voices are not silenced because people are afraid to speak up,"" said Twitter's head of product management Shreyas Doshi in a blog post. ""To that end, we are today announcing our latest product and policy updates that will help us in continuing to develop a platform on which users can safely engage with the world at large."" Some of the changes were outlined last week in a Washington Post column by Twitter general counsel Vijaya Gadde. On Tuesday, Doshi noted that Twitter had updated its  policy on violent threats ""so that the prohibition is not limited to 'direct, specific threats of violence against others' but now extends to 'threats of violence against others or promot(ing) violence against others."" He said the previous policy ""was unduly narrow and limited our ability to act on certain kinds of threatening behavior."" Twitter's new policy also allows the social network to ""lock"" abusive accounts for specific periods of time, which could help crack down on so-called cyberbullying and spam. ""This option gives us leverage in a variety of contexts, particularly where multiple users begin harassing a particular person or group of people,"" Doshi said. Doshi also noted that Twitter would be testing ""a product feature to help us identify suspected abusive Tweets and limit their reach."" The new tool, which was not described in detail, could help Twitter identify abusive activity by looking at ""a wide range of signals and context that frequently correlates with abuse including the age of the account itself, and the similarity of a tweet to other content that our safety team has in the past independently determined to be abusive,"" said Doshi. This tool ""will not affect your ability to see content that you've explicitly sought out, such as tweets from accounts you follow, but instead is designed to help us limit the potential harm of abusive content,"" he noted. Twitter's actions follow initiatives by Facebook as well as Facebook-owned Instagram that aim to crack down on abusive conduct and use of the platforms to promote violence. Social networks have been struggling with defining acceptable content and freedom of expression, and radical extremism and violence increasingly linked to these services. Facebook said last month it will not allow the social network to be used to promote terrorism or hate speech as it unveiled a wide-ranging update of its ""community standards."""

											Philippines arrests 43 for cybersex										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/432970/philippine-agents-arrest-43-in-cybersex-raids,"MANILA â€” Philippine authorities say they have arrested 43 suspected members of a syndicate that runs a lucrative online cybersex operation catering to clients worldwide. The Presidential Anti-Organised Crime Commission said government agents arrested 43 men and women and seized 115 computers in raids on three locations late Wednesday in Dinalupihan town in Bataan province west of Manila. Police said Thursday that the syndicate operated a website at which clients could ask women to perform lewd acts for a fee. The government has been cracking down on cybercrimes in recent years. Easy access to the Internet, a relatively low risk of arrest and big financial gains have caused such crimes to flourish in recent years in countries such as the Philippines."

											Philippine police arrest 36 in cybersex raid										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/tech/215528/philippine-police-arrest-36-in-cybersex-raid,"Thirty-six people have been arrested in the Philippines for illegally selling Internet sex to web users in the United States, authorities said Tuesday. Thirty-six people have been arrested in the Philippines for illegally selling Internet sex to web users in the United States. Police said they would chat with clients via online messaging and persuade customers to part with their credit card details in exchange for obscene pictures or videos.	 The 36 were arrested in a raid on Monday on a supposed Internet cafe that was actually being used to sell pictures and videos of naked women to US clients, said local police officer Myra Sapa. Those detained would chat with clients via online messaging, posing as women and offering to disrobe and perform live sex acts in front of a webcam, said Sapa, based in the northern city of Dinalupihan where the raid took place. ""They would talk about sex and nudity until they convinced their clients to give them their credit card account number. Then they would send pictures and videos,"" she said. ""They pretended that they were these people on the videos. But it was not them. They were giving pre-recorded videos."" It was not known who the actual women on the videos were, said Sapa, adding they were not among those arrested in the raid. The 36 face charges of distributing obscene material and for trafficking of women, Sapa said. If found guilty, they face years in jail. Sapa said some men were among the 36 detained, and they had been posing as women when chatting online to the US clients. However she said the majority of those detained were women. Cybersex dens, where women also disrobe and perform sex acts in return for payment from foreign viewers over the Internet, have become a growing problem in the impoverished Philippines, according to law enforcers and social workers. The National Bureau of Investigation's computer crimes chief, Migdonio Congzon, told AFP in a recent interview that authorities were conducting raids on cybersex dens almost every week. However the number of people arrested in Monday's raid made it one of the biggest to have been reported in the Philippines."

											Cops nab online trickster over sextortion scam										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/1909560/cops-nab-online-trickster-over-sextortion-scam,"CHIANG MAI: A man who allegedly posed as a woman to blackmail a male university student online was arrested yesterday, according to police. Acting on an arrest warrant by the Criminal Court, the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Division (ATPD) and the Thailand Internet Crimes Against Children (TICAC) Task Force arrested Natthawut Klinhom, 20, a native of Chiang Mai. Mr Natthawut has been charged with extortion. According to the authorities, the victim, 19, filed a complaint against Mr Natthawut accusing him of blackmail. The victim said he met Mr Natthawut as a woman online and started a romantic relationship on social media. He said Mr Natthawut started asking for nude photos and he obliged. Mr Natthawut then began extorting money while threatening to release the pictures if the victim refused to pay. The student initially paid, but he could no longer do so after spending 19,000 baht to prevent Mr Natthawut from publishing the photos. The victim then filed the complaint, which led to Mr Natthawut's arrest. The authorities raided Mr Natthawut's home in the province and found the student's photos on a computer and mobile phones. Mr Natthawut reportedly confessed, saying he committed the crime because he needed the money. Meanwhile, ATPD and TICAC law enforcement agents arrested Piyawat Benjawan, 40, for allegedly possessing child porn. Pol Maj Gen Weerachon Boonthawee, investigation chief of Provincial Police Bureau 5, said the TICAC was informed by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation that an individual in the country had downloaded porn featuring minors. Police arrested Mr Piyawat at his home. He reportedly said he downloaded the images because he was bored in self-isolation."

											'Sextortion' aÂ blind spot in fight against corruption										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/700812/sextortion-a-blind-spot-in-fight-against-corruption,"The US immigration officer told a young Colombian woman that he wanted sex, once or twice, and in return would give her a green card, the coveted document that would allow her to live and work in the United States permanently. What he did not know was that the conversation was recorded on a digital camera in her pocket and used as evidence in a case of ""sextortion"", a form of corruption that involves officials abusing their power to obtain a sexual favour. ""Sextortion is very widespread, but it is one of the hardest-to-prove forms of corruption,"" said Nancy Hendry, senior adviseor at the International Association of Women Judges (IAWJ). Statistics are hard to come by but Interpol says reports indicate that sextortion is a growing problem with hundreds of thousands of victims around the world. Prosecutors often have hard evidence and anti-corruption laws to charge people in positions of authority caught taking bribes. But when sex is involved, prosecution is harder because evidence is elusive, the law is unclear and victims often are reluctant to come forward for fear of being shamed. As a result, corruption prosecutions for sextortion remain relatively few. Through heightened awareness, the judges hope to see sextortion get the same attention and penalties as sexual harassment and domestic violence -- crimes that were once ignored or unquestioned. ""People tend to dismiss is, partly because it is seen as part of life,"" Hendry told delegates at the International Anti-Corruption Conference in Malaysia last week. ""But it shouldn't be, just like sexual harassment or domestic violence are unacceptable."" The demand for a sexual favour can be explicit or implicit, and usually employs fear rather than physical forms of coercion. It does not have to involve sexual intercourse or even physical touching, but could be any form of unwanted sexual activity, including exposing body parts or posing for sexual photographs or videos, the IAWJ says. Many sextortion cases happen in the workplace or in educational institutions, where ""sex for grades"" cases may be prosecuted under sexual harassment laws. Han Chee Rull, deputy commissioner at the office of legal research of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission, said sextortion was hard to prove as it is carried out in secrecy. ""Proof is also often hard to obtain due to a lack of evidence of physical violence because perpetrators and victims exchange sexual favours as a quid pro quo -- an exchange of services,"" he told delegates, adding that Malaysia has prosecuted only two cases. Justice Engera Kileo, chairwoman of the Tanzania Women Judges Association, said Tanzania in 2007 recognised the solicitation of sexual favours through abuse of authority as a form of corruption, but the law was too weak to deal with sextortion cases. ""Building awareness and training officials is a key part of our work to stop sextortion from happening in the first place,"" she said. A 2014 study by the IAWJ and the Thomson Reuters Foundation on laws in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Kenya, Mexico, Taiwan, Uganda and the UK found that none of the nine countries had adopted laws that actually use the term sextortion. Interpol has warned that as internet access continues to expand, especially in developing countries, there are likely to be more victims as explicit material is posted online to blackmail people. An Interpol-coordinated operation targeting organised crime networks behind sextortion cases around the world resulted in the arrest of 58 people last year. Thomson Reuters Foundation"

											Google acts to curb 'revenge porn' from search results										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/tech/598136/google-acts-to-curb-revenge-porn-from-search-results,"WASHINGTON - Google said Friday it was taking steps to remove from search results ""revenge porn,"" or sexually explicit images of people posted without their consent. Google said it would soon put up an online form that will allow ""revenge porn"" victims to make requests to remove these items from search queries	 The Internet search giant said it would soon put up an online form that will allow victims to make requests to remove these items from Google search queries. ""We've heard many troubling stories of 'revenge porn': an ex-partner seeking to publicly humiliate a person by posting private images of them, or hackers stealing and distributing images from victims' accounts,"" Google search vice president Amit Singhal said in a blog post. ""Some images even end up on 'sextortion' sites that force people to pay to have their images removed. Our philosophy has always been that search should reflect the whole web. But revenge porn images are intensely personal and emotionally damaging, and serve only to degrade the victims -- predominantly women."" Singhal said Google will ""honor requests from people to remove nude or sexually explicit images shared without their consent from Google search results."" He said it was ""a narrow and limited policy, similar to how we treat removal requests for other highly sensitive personal information, such as bank account numbers and signatures,"" that may surface in search results. ""We know this won't solve the problem of revenge porn -- we aren't able, of course, to remove these images from the websites themselves -- but we hope that honoring people's requests to remove such imagery from our search results can help."" Twitter implemented a similar policy earlier this year, banning ""intimate photos or videos that were taken or distributed without the subject's consent."" Reddit also moved to curb the posting of explicit images without consent of the people in them, after the online bulletin board was criticized for allowing the distribution of hacked nude pictures of Hollywood stars. Google is facing a legal dispute in Europe on a similar matter, after an EU panel ordered the US tech giant to honor requests from individuals to have links to information about them deleted from searches in certain circumstances, such as if the data is outdated or inaccurate."

											Bullying debate after death of K-pop star Goo Hara										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/1801699/bullying-debate-after-death-of-k-pop-star-goo-hara,"SEOUL: Fans mourned and questions were asked Monday after K-pop star and revenge porn victim Goo Hara was found dead in a possible suicide, which would make her the second female singer in a month to take her own life in the high-pressure industry. The body of Goo, a member of former girl group Kara, was discovered Sunday evening at her home in Cheongdam, one of Seoul's wealthiest neighbourhoods. Police were still investigating her cause of death and Yonhap news agency reported they were ""keeping the possibility of suicide in consideration"". In May, the 28-year-old star apologised to her fans after being hospitalised following a suspected suicide attempt, saying she had been ""in agony over a number of issues"". Goo was abused by an ex-boyfriend last year who -- after they split -- blackmailed her over their sex videos. The ex, hairdresser Choi Jong-bum, threatened ""to end her entertainment career"" by leaking the footage, and a CCTV clip of the couple showed the singer kneeling before him apparently begging him not to. In the conservative South, women who appear in such videos often feel shame -- despite being the victims -- and face ostracism and social isolation if the images become public. The man was convicted of multiple crimes including blackmail in August and was given a suspended jail term, but the star had been targeted by abusive online comments since the incident. Before her body was discovered on Sunday her Instagram account was flooded with hate comments about her appearance and her history with her ex. Goo made her debut in 2008 with Kara -- for several years one of the two biggest K-pop girl groups -- and pursued a solo career after the group broke up, completing a tour of Japan last week. Her death sparked an online petition on the website of the Southâ€™s presidential office calling for stronger punishments for cybercrimes and abusive online comments, which garnered more than 20,000 signatures in less than a day. ""It was not long ago that we lost someone through hate comments and this cannot happen again,"" the petition said. ""Please protect the people from hate comments and criticisms that are spreading like a virus."" Goo's last Instagram post on Saturday evening showed her in bed with the caption, ""Good night"".  

 South Korea has one of the world's highest rates of suicide which, according to recent government figures, is among the top causes of death for those under 40. Taboos about mental illness also dissuade many South Koreans from seeking help. Goo's death comes a month after Sulli -- a fellow K-pop star and her close friend -- took her own life in October after a long struggle with online bullying. Beneath the glitz and glamour, the K-pop industry is known for its cut-throat competitiveness, lack of privacy, online bullying, and relentless public pressure to maintain a wholesome image at all times and at any cost. K-pop stars like Goo and Sulli are picked up by agencies at a young age -- usually in their early- or mid-teens -- and live under tight control, with their days taken over by gruelling singing and dancing training. Earlier this year Goo had spoken out about abusive comments, depression, and her difficult life as a celebrity. ""We have to be careful about every move we make in our lives and are suffering from a pain that we can't share even with our friends and family,"" said Goo, adding that anyone can struggle with depression. ""You all have freedom of expression, but can you please look back on yourself before posting a hate comment?"" she said. Fans mourned the star's death and lamented that she was unable to hear the voices of support. ""The stars appear to have a shining presence but they live with a pain that no one will understand,"" a fan wrote on Goo's Instagram account. ""How many more victims after Sulli and Goo will there have to be to understand that hate comments hurt others?"" the writer added. Another fan wrote: ""Maybe you couldn't hear the voices of love and support because the voices of hate were too loud. My heart aches.""

Jung Joon-young (centre) appeared at the court for a hearing hours earlier and said he had ""committed unforgivable crimes"". The singer-songwriter last week admitted to filming himself having sex and sharing the footage without his partners' consent. The videos of at least 10 women were shared through mobile chat rooms in 2015 with recipients including fellow K-pop star Seungri of Big Bang. The Seoul Central District Court issued the arrest warrant late Thursday, hours after Jung appeared at a hearing and apologised for committing ""unforgivable crimes"", the South's Yonhap news agency reported. ""I am sorry. I made a big and inexcusable mistake, and I admit my guilt,"" he said. ""I will live my days repenting for the sins."" Following the hearing, the 30-year-old was led away in handcuffs and taken to a police station to await the court's decision on the warrant. Jung announced his retirement from the entertainment industry last week and two other male singers have also quit after admitting they watched the illicit videos. South Korea has been battling a growing epidemic of so-called ""molka"", or spycam videos -- mostly of women, secretly filmed by men in schools, toilets and offices. ""Revenge porn"" -- videos taken of sexual relations without the partner's consent -- is believed to be equally widespread. Thousands of women protested in Seoul last year on several occasions against the videos as part of the country's growing #MeToo movement."

											Facebook to use photo-matching to block repeat 'revenge porn'										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/tech/1227663/facebook-to-use-photo-matching-to-block-repeat-revenge-porn,"SAN FRANCISCO - Facebook Inc is adding tools on Wednesday to make it easier for users to report so-called ""revenge porn"" and to automatically prevent the images from being shared again once they have been banned, the company said. ""Revenge porn"" refers to the sharing of sexually explicit images on the internet, without the consent of the people depicted in the pictures, in order to extort or humiliate them. The practice disproportionately affects women, who are sometimes targeted by former partners. Facebook has been sued in the United States and elsewhere by people who said it should have done more to prevent the practice. The company in 2015 made clear that images ""shared in revenge"" were forbidden, and users have long had the ability to report posts as violating the terms of service. Beginning on Wednesday, users of the world's largest social network should see an option to report a picture as inappropriate specifically because it is a ""nude photo of me,"" Facebook said in a statement. The company also said it was launching an automated process to prevent the repeat sharing of banned images. Photo-matching software will keep the pictures off the core Facebook network as well as off its Instagram and Messenger services, it said. Users who share ""revenge porn"" may see their accounts disabled, the company said. Facing criticism, the company last year met representatives from more than 150 women's safety organisations and decided it needed to do more, Antigone Davis, global head of safety at Facebook, said in a phone interview. A specially trained group of Facebook employees will provide human review of each reported image, Davis said. The process to prevent repeat sharing requires Facebook to retain the banned pictures in a database, although the images are blurred and only a small number of employees have access to the database, the company said. Prosecutors and lawmakers have also sought ways to prevent the spread of ""revenge porn,"" seeking additional penalties for a practice that they said has ruined careers and families and even led to suicide."

											Fury at Singapore's weak penalties for attacks on women										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/1973583/fury-at-singapores-weak-penalties-for-attacks-on-women,"SINGAPORE: Sexual harassment and assaults against women are not being taken seriously enough in Singapore, activists warn, after students at elite universities were given punishments criticised as too lenient for their crimes. In the most recent incident, a 23-year-old spent just 12 days behind bars after he tried to strangle his ex-girlfriend during a vicious assault. The city-state is known for its tough approach to law and order, with vandalism punishable by caning, while drug trafficking and murder carry the death penalty. But campaigners say crimes against women have long been minimalised -- marital rape was only criminalised this year. ""The justice system is very harsh on people who vandalise state-owned property. But you want to threaten and violate a woman's life? Oh yeah, sure. It's not as serious, is the message (authorities) are giving,"" said Pamela Ng, a spokeswoman for the Aim For Zero campaign against sexual violence. There are also concerns the academic potential of male perpetrators is being prioritised over the actual effect of sex crimes on women. This echoes criticisms of incidents at prestigious schools in the US, including the six-month imprisonment of Brock Turner for three counts of sexual assault, where a judge feared a longer sentence would severely ""impact"" the Stanford University swimmer. Last year, National University of Singapore (NUS) student Monica Baey took to social media to protest the light punishment given to a male student who filmed her in a dormitory shower. Her decision to go public was dubbed the city-state's #MeToo moment and is credited with encouraging other victims to come forward. But critics say recent cases involving men of privilege show not enough has changed. - 'Slap on the wrists' - In July, Yin Zi Qin, a dentistry student at NUS, was jailed for less than two weeks and asked to conduct 80 hours of community service despite pleading guilty to strangling his ex-girlfriend and pressing his thumb into her eye until she lost consciousness. The judge opted for softer ""community-based sentencing"" put forward by the prosecution as he was a first offender, cooperated with authorities, and voluntarily sought counselling and to apologise to the victim. But it provoked a public backlash with some angry the privileged only get a ""slap on the wrists"" for serious crimes. ""I can't believe the sentence is so light! I guess NUS students have such a bright future that they can get away with any crime,"" commented Maruko Chan on a social media post about the ruling. ""Because he's a medical student and a future doctor?... Go ahead do more of wrist slapping,"" said netizen Huew Lim. In another case, NUS student Terence Siow Kai Yuan was sentenced to 21 months of supervised probation for molesting a woman on a train and at a station. The judge rejected the prosecution's call for a custodial sentence saying he had a high chance of being rehabilitated given his academic record and ""relatively minor"" nature of his acts, according to court documents. However, his victim told The New Paper, the attack was not ""spur of the moment"" and the impact on her had not been minor. Siow was later jailed for two weeks after prosecutors appealed. Following the July case, women's rights group AWARE raised concerns that more consideration was being shown for the assailant than the impact on the victims. ""Rehabilitation is important but this should not depend on the educational status of the perpetrator,"" AWARE executive director Corinna Lim adds. - 'Sexual violence normalised' - Vanessa who runs Instagram account upand.out, which aims to empower youth, says the system must treat everyone equally. ""23-years-old = fully functioning adult. He is fully capable of higher thinking if he was accepted in one of our top university's most competitive courses. If SG is taking a more compassionate stance for crimes now, it should be reflected in every case,"" the 22-year-old, who gave only her first name, added. There were 56 cases of sexual misconduct involving students from six Singapore universities between 2015 and 2017, according to information Education Minister Ong Ye Kung provided to Parliament last May. NUS toughened penalties for sexual misconduct after the Baey case in 2019, and said Yin Zi Qin is suspended pending disciplinary proceedings. Despite the growing concerns, Singapore lawyer Gloria James-Civetta cautioned that the judiciary could only operate within the ""boundaries prescribed by legislators"". ""In some instances, the academic background of the offender may be indicative of the offender's possibilities for reform,"" she explained. Singapore has toughened some of its sex crime laws, with ""cyber-flashing"" -- sending unsolicited images of one's private parts -- and ""revenge porn"" recently outlawed. And public anger has forced government action -- Home Affairs and Law Minister K. Shanmugam has announced a review of how sentencing decisions are made in such cases. But campaigners warn it will take a shift in attitudes at every level for real change to happen. Ng says sexual violence has been ""normalised"" to such an extent that it shaped society's attitudes and responses to crime's against women. She added: ""It's inherited false beliefs that survivors are somehow responsible for the crimes against them and that somehow if you are Singapore-Chinese, male and educated, you are somehow less responsible or accountable for such violent crimes."""

											Microsoft joins effort to curb 'revenge porn'										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/tech/631452/microsoft-joins-effort-to-curb-revenge-porn,"WASHINGTON - Microsoft announced Wednesday it was joining an effort to curb so-called ""revenge porn,"" by helping victims remove links to sexually explicit images of them posted without their consent. Microsoft says revenge porn victims still need stronger protections across the Web	 ""When someone shares intimate images of another person online without that person's consent, the effects can be truly devastating,"" said Microsoft chief online safety office Jacqueline Beauchere in a blog post. ""Unfortunately, revenge porn is on the rise across the globe. It can damage nearly every aspect of a victim's life: relationships, career, social activities. In the most severe and tragic cases, it has even led to suicide."" Beauchere said Microsoft has honored requests to take down such content, but that it has now established a new reporting page that makes the process easier. The page is currently available in English ""and will be expanded to other languages in the coming weeks,"" Beauchere said. ""When we remove links or content, we will do so globally."" Google, Twitter, Reddit and others have implemented similar policies. ""Clearly, this reporting mechanism is but one small step in a growing and much-needed effort across the public and private sectors to address the problem,"" Beauchere said. ""It's important to remember, for example, that removing links in search results to content hosted elsewhere online doesn't actually remove the content from the Internet -- victims still need stronger protections across the Web and around the world."""

											Get a grip on bullying										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/1938840/get-a-grip-on-bullying,"As a corporate employee, I feel privileged that I'm able to work from home for most of the week. While the nature of my job allows me and my small team to carry on as usual, many other kinds of work require the physical presence of staff in a place of business. But the more time I've spent at home, the more distressing news I've been seeing about harassment, abuse and domestic violence. Online abuse is a growing concern. In Japan, the number of people who called a government hotline to report online abuse exceeded 5,100 in the fiscal year ending in March, compared to slightly over 1,000 nine years ago, a recent report showed. With home-bound people spending even more time on social media, some of it for work purposes, we've been seeing more cases of intimidation and abuse in the virtual world. The conventional wisdom is that working from home should free people from exposure to toxic workplace behaviour. But the new normal approach has actually opened the door for other forms of harassment. Harassment and intimidation based on gender or race has taken the form of being excluded from virtual meetings or bullied over video calls. Such provocations would have been harder to carry out in an office where other people are present. During not-so-formal meetings and conversations online, the boundaries between work and private life are blurred, which can also create a climate for harassment. Working out of our kitchens and living rooms can lead people to let their guard down and be more informal, or in some cases, improper. A comment about what colleagues, clients or other contacts see in the background at our house can all too easily be followed by unsolicited remarks about a person's appearance or by an inappropriate joke. Some companies have postponed investigations into harassment cases due to the pandemic. This is definitely not an encouraging sign. Virtual communication also provides a degree of anonymity that can lead people to act in ways they would not in person. The result has been the rise of cyberbullying as a global phenomenon. In Japan, the severity of the problem was driven home by the recent death of Hana Kimura, a 22-year-old professional wrestler and reality-TV star. She posted self-harm images on Twitter shortly before taking her life, implying she had suffered from cyberbullying. Her case has drawn attention once more to the delicate balance of regulation versus free speech. The bullying culture in Japan is so pervasive that Covid-related school closures and telecommuting have given rise to jokes about the unexpected benefits of staying at home -- a reprieve from school and workplace bullying. But the bullies are still there, lurking behind their screens. While those who have been defamed online can ask telecom providers and website operators to voluntarily disclose anonymous attackers' IP addresses, names and street addresses, the fact is governments have struggled to come up with effective solutions. Early this month, regulations to protect workers in Japan from abusive bosses and colleagues took effect. Large companies now must combat so-called power harassment, which includes such acts as striking an employee with one's bare hands or an object. Firms are legally required to have strict policies against workplace bullying. They must train employees and have a contact point for reporting cases of abuse. Companies allowing egregious abuse to occur will be publicly named. But cyberbullying is harder to police and not solely a Japanese problem. Similar cases have been reported in South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand. South Korean legislators have been pushing a bill that proposes making anti-cyberbullying education compulsory in schools, and allowing the identification and prosecution of those who post malicious online content. Of course, laws cannot fix every problem we face. Better behaviour should start with improved education in schools about how to use the internet more effectively and ethically. There is also no quick fix for office harassment and bullying, but employers can put more effort into offering training and following up on complaints. Companies, meanwhile, need to send a strong anti-harassment message and get more people involved in rooting out misconduct, while staff must be encouraged to speak up when they spot inappropriate behaviour. Experts also recommend easier reporting mechanisms for employees. As company managers focus on returning to work as virus concerns ease, healthy employment conditions must be a firm priority. Among those, concerns about harassment can't be ignored."

""A handwritten note that was pessimistic about her life was found on a living room table,"" Lee Yong-pyo, commissioner of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency, told reporters. Fans mourning Koo's death flocked to her funeral home on Monday, while her colleagues cancelled their schedules and relayed condolences. Koo, 28, was discovered at her home in southern Seoul by her maid at around 6pm on Sunday, Lee said. Better known as Hara in other parts of Asia, Koo had spoken out against cyberbullying. In June, a month after she was found unconscious at her home and hospitalised, she said on social media that it was difficult to fight depression and vowed to respond sternly to malicious online comments. ""It is so sad that she had to suffer from vicious, inhumane comments at such a young age just because she was a celebrity,"" said 20-year-old student Kim Nam-gun, one of about two dozen fans who gathered at the funeral home. Koo debuted with the five-member band Kara in 2008. They helped fan the global K-pop wave, building large fan bases in Japan, China and other countries. After her deal with a South Korean management agency was terminated, Koo launched a solo career in Japan and held a concert there this month. Another K-pop star, Sulli, a former member of girl group f(x) and a close friend of Koo's, was found dead at her home in October. Sulli, 25, whose real name was Choi Jin-ri, had also spoken out about cyberbullying."

											Browbeating bullies										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/1781299/browbeating-bullies,"I'm not a fan of any boy bands or girl groups from South Korea but I was shocked by the news of the death of Sulli that made big headlines in Thailand two weeks ago. I didn't know much about her before but the speculation that her sudden death was suicide and that cyberbullying may have been a contributing factor saddened me and made me curious to know what happened to her life. Sulli was a 25-year-old K-pop star who began acting professionally when at the age of 11 and made her singing debut with the famous girl group f(x) when she was 15. However, she left the band six years later to focus on her acting career, which saw her in a string of movies and TV series that earned her a New Star Award. In the middle of this year, she made her debut as a solo artist and launched a single album of her own. At a glance, Sulli seemed to be a young happy girl with a bright future in the South Korean entertainment world. But what she had to endure along the path as an entertainer was far from entertaining at all. In real life, she was a victim of what many have described as ""toxic fan culture"" where many stars are left defenceless while having to encounter hateful comments, malicious rumours and cyberbullying online. In the case of Sulli, some Korean critics have related her falling prey to such mean behaviour to her being an unconventional girl who dared to speak her mind and refused to conform with social norms in deeply conservative Korean society where celebrities are expected to be respectful and reserved. On the contrary, she was often seen to attract controversy with her dating, clothing choices and outspoken comments on feminism. At the height of her singing career five years ago, Sulli was caught having been in a relationship with her much older boyfriend and received many vicious comments and false rumours to the point where she reportedly suffered from stress-related pain and decided to take a break from the music industry. Their relationship ended three years later but the verbal violence against her online never stopped. Sulli then drew a bigger and longer round of heavy criticism when she posted on her Instagram pictures of herself wearing a shirt without a bra. Just recently, she insisted that going braless was one's freedom and she expressed her wish that people would discard their prejudices. Looking from the outside, Sulli seemed to be a defiant girl who didn't care much about the anonymous haters who kept insulting her on social media and spoke out strongly against it. But last year she revealed on a TV show that the online abuse had contributed to her panic disorder and social phobia that she had suffered since she was young. Sadly, not many knew that prior to her death, she was suffering from severe depression. In the wake of her death, many of her fans, friends and also celebrities have demanded a change in the anonymous comment culture on the Internet where users are allowed to leave comments without revealing their real names. Lawmakers in Korea are proposing a new bill, nicknamed ""Sulli's Law,"" with the aim to enforce strict rules against malicious comments under anonymous titles. No matter to the exact causes of her death, it feels awfully bad to see a young talented and beautiful woman mentally tormented because she was honest about her own views and thoughts. Her death is a wake-up call for her country to take cyberbullying more seriously. Cyberbullying has caused a big headache in many countries. Research has found that it can cause significant emotional and psychological distress to people from any age or walk of life. In Thailand, harsh comments are everywhere on social media, mostly targeting certain politicians and celebrities. I'm not worried about them at all as most are tough enough to ignore the remarks and, in many cases, ready to fight back. But my concern is on our young children who are growing with the cyber world and are naturally fragile to unkind words. I don't know what it takes to successfully stop cyberbullying even though there have been efforts by many parties concerned over the years to protect children from being bullied online. But I think that it's equally important to promote a new generation of netizens and implant in them a sense of respect from a young age. They should be taught to understand and accept each other's differences and show their disagreement in a reasonable manner. As long as they can learn to respect the differences of individuals, they would not easily harbour hatred towards others. Then, I believe they will grow up to be open-minded adults who will not cross the line to inflict pain on anyone. Patcharawalai Sanyanusin is a writer for Life section of the Bangkok Post."
