											Pandemic of abuse										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/1958095/pandemic-of-abuse,"Stay-at-home and lockdown measures have helped to contain the greatest public-health threat the world has seen in decades. But as Covid-19 receded in many countries, a new public-health crisis was emerging behind closed doors, with increased domestic violence against women and children. With people stuck at home and schools closed, it has become harder to tap the usual sources of support such as friends, extended family or professionals, leaving victims unable to seek and obtain help, say health professionals. Stress occurring during the pandemic and economic instability have also been catalysts that exacerbate the risk of violence, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Data compiled by the WHO showed that even in normal times, almost one in three women worldwide report experiencing physical and/or sexual violence by their partner or sexual violence by someone else in their lifetime. The UN Population Fund (UNFPA), meanwhile, estimated in May that if lockdowns continue for six months, an extra 31 million cases of gender-based violence could be expected globally. ""Often abused women and children are afraid to talk because of fear or shame. This 'window' to speak up and seek help is, during confinement, even more restricted,"" says Mariya Gabriel, the European Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth. ""As a matter of fact, in some countries, we have seen an increase in reports of domestic violence since the outbreak of Covid-19."" Najat Maalla M'jid, special representative of the UN Secretary-General for Violence against Children, shared the same view, adding that ""confinement measures and the disrupted provision of already limited child protection services exacerbated the vulnerability of children to various forms of violence"". CHILD VICTIMS Violence against children, according to the WHO, encompasses all forms of violence including abuse and neglect occurring to children under 18 years of age. It can be physical and/or emotional ill-treatment, sexual abuse, neglect, or other exploitation, which results in actual or potential harm to the child's health, survival and development. The health agency's Global Status Report on Preventing Violence Against Children 2020, released last month, shed light on the prevalence of violence against children. It estimated that 300 million children -- nearly three out of four worldwide -- aged two to four years old regularly suffer physical punishment and/or psychological violence at the hands of parents and caregivers. Moreover, one in five women and one in 13 men report having been sexually abused as a child (before age 17), while 120 million girls and young women under age 20 have suffered some form of forced sexual contact. Child maltreatment often leaves serious life-long consequences. Physically, maltreatment causes stress associated with disruption in early brain development. Extreme stress can impair the development of the nervous and immune systems. Maltreated children, when they enter adulthood, are at increased risk for behavioural, physical and mental health problems such as perpetrating or being a victim of violence, depression, smoking, high-risk sexual behaviours, unintended pregnancy, alcohol and drug abuse, according to the report. The abused person is also more likely to become an abuser once they grow up. Therefore, violence is often passed down from one generation to the next, perpetuating a vicious cycle. More alarmingly, the health agency also documented that every year, there are an estimated 40,150 homicides in children under 18 years of age, some of which are likely linked to maltreatment. The agency, however, said that a significant proportion of deaths due to child maltreatment are often incorrectly attributed to falls, burns, drowning and other causes. Even though causes of maltreatment vary, the report emphasises that it is important to emphasise that children are the victims and are never to blame. The report shows that characteristics of an individual child that may increase the likelihood of being maltreated include ""being either under four years old or an adolescent, being unwanted, having special needs, having abnormal physical features, having an intellectual disability or neurological disorder, and identifying as or being identified as LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender)"", among others. The economic costs of the lifetime consequences of violence against children are also severe: In the United States alone, the WHO estimated, the costs amount to US$228 billion per year. To tackle the problem head-on, it's necessary to break the cycle of violence to create positive multi-generational impacts, by preventing child maltreatment before it begins. This requires an approach involving multiple parties. Effective prevention approaches, according to the WHO, include supporting parents and teaching positive parenting skills and enhancing laws to prohibit violent punishment. The global community has made some progress in addressing the issue. The good news is that 89% of countries have multiple sectors responsible for addressing violence against children, while 80% reported having at least one national action plan to prevent violence against children. The less encouraging news is that only 47% of countries said these plans, laws and rules were being strongly enforced. There is also a need to develop a quality education to empower children, allowing them to acquire knowledge, skills and experiences that build resilience and reduce risk factors for violence. Further, a systemic shift in restrictive and harmful gender and social norms around child-rearing, child discipline and gender equality are required. Governments play a central role in this endeavour. To put an end to violence against children, the report suggests governments strengthen their legislative framework, having laws that prohibit all forms of violence against children, and ensure that they have agencies with a mandate and appropriate resources to coordinate action to end violence against children. The report also suggests governments prioritise data collection on key violence-related indicators and use these to set measurable targets in national action plans. ONLINE ABUSE School closures as part of government lockdown measures have affected some 1.5 billion children worldwide. With the closures, online communities have played an important part in maintaining learning, support and play for many children. However, an increase in harmful online behaviour including cyberbullying, risky online behaviour and sexual exploitation have also been identified. From Asia to Europe, cases of online child sexual abuse have soared as children spend more time online, making them more vulnerable to abusers as Covid-19 gave predators access to new groups of children who before the lockdown didn't spend as much time online. In Australia, police warned that ""insidious"" online predators were targeting new victims after a surge in coronavirus infections put Melbourne under partial lockdown. During the earlier lockdown, traffic to websites hosting online child sexual abuse content skyrocketed and such material posted to the dark web doubled, said the police. ""We suspect that offenders will use this second wave of Covid-19 as an opportunity to find more potential child victims, as young people spend an increasing amount of time online with limited adult supervision,"" Australian Federal Police Commander Jamie Strauss said. In Australia, child exploitation has been on the rise in recent years. Nearly 22,000 cases were reported between July 2019 and June 2020, up by almost 50% from a year ago, official figures show. Lockdowns have also led to the rise another insidious activity: bullying and cyberbullying. Even before the lockdown, the United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef) ranked bullying among the top concerns of children. The issue is widespread throughout the world, affecting a significant percentage of children as victims, perpetrators or bystanders. In a 2019 Unesco report, Behind the Numbers: Ending School Violence and Bullying, bullying is highlighted a major problem worldwide, with 32% of students aged 11 to 15 bullied by their peers at school at least once in the last month. In a poll conducted by Unicef in 2019, more than a third of young people in 30 countries report being a victim of online bullying. Cyberbullying, which involves the posting or sending of messages, pictures or videos, aimed at harassing, threatening or targeting another person. Although the prevalence of cyberbullying is low compared with other forms of school violence and bullying, it is an increasing problem and is on the rise during the pandemic. ""During the Covid-19 pandemic, and the related school closures, we have seen a rise in violence and hate online - and this includes bullying. Now, as schools begin to reopen, children are expressing their fears about going back to school,"" said Unesco director-general Audrey Azoulay. To prevent bullying, legislation is needed to safeguard the rights of children and underpin policies to prevent and respond to school violence and bullying, train and support teachers to prevent and respond to school violence and bullying. There is also a need to empower victims by providing information and support to children to enable them to speak up and seek help. ABUSE IN SPORT Sport is another area where child abuse has long been prevalent, but where victims have been afraid to speak out until recently. Young people, especially those who aspire to become high-performance athletes, spend as much of their time around coaches as they do with their families and are often targets of exploitation or worse. A Human Rights Watch (HRW) report published this month, which documented the experiences of more than 800 athletes in 50 sports, found that in Japan, child athletes often suffer physical and verbal abuse and sometimes sexual abuse during training. The report titled ""I Was Hit So Many Times I Can't Count"": Abuse of Child Athletes in Japan, exposed a toxic culture in Japanese sport, which involves the use of physical violence as a coaching technique. Such practices are seen as essential to achieving excellence in competition and in personal character. Many child athletes had been punched, kicked or experienced verbal abuse, while others reported being ordered to eat excessively, denied water or told to train even when injured. The ""tradition"" makes eradicating physical abuse in sport hard because coaches, parents and some players believe that there's value in physical abuse. Abusive coaching techniques documented in the report include, but are not limited to, hitting children with bats or bamboo kendo sticks, slapping children, and simulated drowning. In 2013, the Japanese Olympic Committee (JOC), promised to take steps to eradicate violence among its sports federations after an internal survey revealed more than 10% of its athletes had been victims of bullying or harassment. However, the watchdog said that not enough had been done since then and demanded organisations such as the Japan Sports Council and the JOC use the upcoming Olympics as a catalyst for change. The watchdog's national director, Kanae Doi, said that even though child abuse in sports today is a global problem, the organisation chose to focus on Japan for 2020 because the Olympics and Paralympics will be held in Japan. Young athletes are often afraid to report abuse largely because Japanese culture emphasises respecting elders, leaving violent coaches to continue their harassment, said Takuya Yamazaki, a sports lawyer who worked on the HRW report. But Japan is not unique in this domain. In South Korea, the story of Choi Suk-hyeon, a promising triathlete who committed suicide in June, also exposed the culture of malpractice in the country. The story broke when Choi's family released a diary and secret recordings in which the young triathlete documented years of physical and psychological abuse that she said she suffered at the hands of her team's coach, doctor and two senior teammates. The diaries and recordings have set off a firestorm of criticism about the corruption and abuse that critics say has long pervaded the South Korean sports community. South Korea has slowly emerged as a global sports powerhouse, with its athletes winning Olympic gold medals and other prizes. But recurring scandals have revealed widespread physical violence, sexual assault and other forms of abuse against athletes, many of whom are young, vulnerable and live away from their families during training."

He started posting photos of Lisa on the cafe's Facebook page, bragging that someone wanted to buy a sofa on which the sexy star sat, before saying he in fact wasn't satisfied with the price offered. Then he joked about selling other things Lisa used during her visit, such as a glass, a spoon, a napkin and even a toilet seat. Last month, fans of the K-pop singer expressed their fury as they thought the comments posted by the cafe owner were inappropriate and were considered cyberbullying and harassment. The fans attacked the cafe on Facebook and created a Twitter trend, #LowClassMQQNCafe, which was used worldwide. The owner decided to post his apology to Lisa's fans while also telling them to calm down and that he didn't harass Lisa at all. After his ignorance, the cafe's Facebook page received lots of criticism. He eventually accepted his guilt and apologised to Lisa and her fans. The cafe has reportedly shut down indefinitely since the incident. This is just the latest case of sexual harassment that happens in a patriarchal society where many people -- including the MQQN Cafe owner and his friends -- don't even realise their actions constitute sexual harassment. This happens in part because Thai men have grown up with the attitude that they can express their sexual desires openly, said Jaded Chouwilai, director of the Women and Men Progressive Movement Foundation (WMP). ""Men are allowed to go to prostitutes when they have sexual desires. They haven't been trained to restrain themselves from their sexual drives and it becomes a problem. As boys, they like to lift the skirts of girls and tease them. When they grow up, they like to tease and wolf-whistle pretty women, and think it is something normal,"" Jaded said. In terms of international law, Jaded said that sexual harassment is a significant issue. ""Sexual harassment starts with whistling, staring, leering and unwelcome verbal conduct. Some men have the misperception that if he keeps approaching a woman, she will like him. There are cases of men getting closer to women to make plans to rape them,"" he added. Lalisa Manoban, better known as Lisa, from K-pop band Blackpink. Photo © lalalalisa_m : Instagram With this kind of attitude, lots of Thai women have encountered sexual harassment. According to a 2017 survey of about 1,600 public-transportation passengers by the Safe Cities for Women Network, one in three people experience sexual harassment while on public transport. Women, who accounted for around 45% of respondents, were harassed the most. LGBTI was the next group, followed by men. The unwelcome conduct that victims experienced most was looking under skirts or staring at their breasts (18.8%). Touching, leaning and cornering victims took second place (15.4%). Next was whistling at victims (13.9%). And uninvited or unwanted flirting was fourth (13.1%). Unfortunately, only 28% of the sexually harassed reported it to the police, while 12% chose to ignore the situation and walked away. Since we live in a male-dominated society, sexual harassment is treated like it isn't a serious issue. It is a misdemeanour charge. Asst Prof Tanawut Wonganan from the Faculty of Law, Valaya Alongkorn Rajabhat University under Royal Patronage, mentioned the case of Lisa on his Facebook page. He posted the definition of sexual harassment provided by the Royal Institute Dictionary's Psychology Vocabulary, saying it means any actions including leering, unwelcome sexual statements or other harassment that troubles, annoys or causes psychogenic pain. Tanawut posted that sexual harassment has a misdemeanour charge according to an amendment to Section 397 of the criminal code. ""Any actions that tend to be sexual harassment shall be liable to imprisonment for not longer than one month or a fine not exceeding 10,000 baht, or both,"" he posted. When it comes to sexual harassment, unwelcome verbal conduct or an unwanted action can be interpreted several ways. Naiyana Supapung, director of the Teeranat Kanjanauksorn Foundation (TKF), which promotes gender equality, explained that sexual harassment cases are different from others. ""When looking at a criminal case, we focus on the intent of an attacker. In a sexual harassment case, we concentrate on what a person who is harassed thinks or how a victim feels. In one case, a female bus conductor wasn't comfortable that a bus driver liked to slap her butt and make a dirty joke about her body. He claimed he did that to other bus conductors and nobody complained. Yet what he felt didn't matter. What mattered was how the conductor felt,"" the TKF director explained. ""Sexual harassment is about a person who has power harassing someone who has a lower status. We don't see a male employee harassing a factory owner or a daughter of the owner."" Fighting sexual harassment isn't easy. When someone faces sexual harassment, what should she or he do? Jaded suggested that victims need to collect evidence. And it is difficult to file a lawsuit if a victim is harassed by unwanted staring or unwelcome verbal conduct. ""Many victims who were harassed by leering or inappropriate comments didn't complain. They think if it wasn't a touching case, it would be difficult to make a case because we need clear evidence. Yet anyone who needs legal advice can come to WMP,"" Jaded said. ""There are counselling services available at the Department of Mental Health Hotline, 1323, the Department of Social Development and Welfare, 1300, and organisations helping women,"" Naiyana suggested. And if a victim can express her feelings to harassers, she should do so. ""A confrontation in a public place such as a workplace can make a harasser feel embarrassed and stop harassing. A harasser keeps harassing a woman because he knows that she is afraid of speaking up or thinks it is something normal,"" Jaded said. Naiyana echoed the idea. ""A person who can speak up must have had experience of power gender imbalance for a while. Thirty years ago, I felt that guys had power above me. A victim must know what she can do and what consequences will occur afterward,"" said Naiyana. Improving the unbalanced power structure in a male-dominated society, both Naiyana and Jaded believe, should start at the family level. The idea that sexual harassment isn't something normal should be implanted early. ""Don't think harassment is a normal practice,"" Jaded concluded. ""Don't get used to sexual harassment. When men have harassment ideas, they think about sex. If we don't change this action, it will be more violent or lead to a rape. Our education is also a failure. In textbooks, we have images of women as housewives who behave conservatively. The education system oppresses women and LGBTI, especially in a patriarchal society. We should learn about gender equality, and every gender is entitled to equal respect."""

											'Vile' UK paedophile receives 13 life sentences										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/1195113/vile-uk-paedophile-receives-13-life-sentences,"LONDON - A retired English teacher was jailed for at least 16 years on Wednesday for what the judge called an ""appalling catalogue"" of sex offences against children in Thailand and Britain. Mark Frost, aka Andrew Tracey: Groomed, then raped young Thai and British boys. Mark Frost, 70, also known as Andrew Tracey admitted 45 sex offences against nine children in Thailand between 2009 and 2012, and two British pupils in the 1990s. The offences including rape, sexual assault and inciting sexual activity with a child under 13. His victims were aged between 10 and 15. At England's Central Criminal Court in London, he was sentenced to serve 13 concurrent life sentences and will spend a minimum of 16 years in jail. His crimes were ""the most appalling catalogue of sexual abuse"", judge Mark Lucraft said. ""It is clear you have an obsession with sexually abusing young boys with evidence of planning and grooming. Your conduct towards each and every one of these victims is horrific and deeply disturbing."" He added Frost's offences were ""truly shocking"" and that he was someone who will continue to pose a risk to children. The court heard how Frost groomed Thai boys with cash and sweets - then raped them and encouraged them to engage in sex acts. ""The harrowing evidence presented by the prosecution in this case outlined the suffering that Mark Frost caused to his victims,"" said Ruona Iguyovwe, from the state's Crown Prosecution Service. ""Over many years, Frost repeatedly exploited vulnerable young victims, both in the UK and in Thailand, for his own sexual gratification. ""His offending has caused severe psychological harm to all of the children he abused, many of whom are now old enough to realise the enormity of what happened to them."" The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) urged other potential victims to come forward. ""Mark Frost's vile campaign of sickening child abuse spanned over quarter of a century in the UK and abroad, and today's sentence will likely see him spending the rest of his days behind bars,"" a spokesman said. ""Frost was a prolific and dangerous paedophile who worked as a teacher and Scout leader for decades. We hope that anyone who suffered can now find the courage to speak out."""

											Police search German allotment garden in Madeleine McCann case										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/1958875/police-search-german-allotment-garden-in-madeleine-mccann-case,"BERLIN - Police are searching an allotment plot in the northern German city of Hanover in connection with the disappearance of British girl Madeleine McCann, prosecutors said Tuesday. Madeleine went missing from her family's holiday apartment in the Portuguese holiday resort of Praia da Luz on May 3, 2007, a few days before her fourth birthday, as her parents dined with friends at a nearby tapas bar.  Despite a huge international manhunt, no trace of her has been found, nor has anyone been charged over her disappearance.  ""I can confirm that the search is being carried out in connection with our investigations into the Maddie McCann case,"" Brunswick prosecutor Julia Meyer told AFP, when asked about the operation first reported by local Hannoversche Allgemeine newspaper. Police began searching the site in the early hours of Tuesday morning, clearing trees and using an excavator, the newspaper report said. Meyer gave no details of how the plot was connected to the case or what they were hoping to find. Police revealed in June that they were investigating a 43-year-old German man over the 2007 disappearance of three-year-old ""Maddie"", saying they believe he killed her. The suspect, who was not named by police but identified by German media as Christian B., lived in Hanover from 2007, according to the Hannoversche Allgemeine. - Previous convictions - Christian B. has a history of previous convictions including child sex offences and rape. He is currently serving a sentence for drug trafficking in Kiel. He has applied to be released early on probation after having completed two-thirds of the sentence, with a decision still pending.  A court in Brunswick had separately sentenced Christian B. to seven years in prison last December for an assault against a 72-year-old American tourist in 2005 -- in the same seaside village of Praia da Luz where Maddie went missing. But that sentence has not yet been finalised pending an appeal by the defendant's lawyers over extradition technicalities. - 'Concrete evidence' - According to police, the suspect lived in the Algarve region of Portugal between 1995 and 2007.  He made a living doing odd jobs in the area where Madeleine was taken, and also burgled hotel rooms and holiday flats. German prosecutors said in June they had ""concrete evidence"" that Madeleine is dead, despite British police continuing to treat her disappearance as a missing persons case. However, despite repeated appeals for information, prosecutors have no forensic evidence and have so far not filed any formal charges. In a recent TV appeal, investigators said they were looking for the owner of a Portuguese mobile phone number that Christian B. had called in May 2007. While living in Hanover, Christian B. received fines for forgery in 2010 and for theft in 2013, according to a report by German news agency DPA. He split his time between Germany and Portugal from 2013 to 2015, the report said, citing prosecutors in Hanover. At the end of 2012, he reportedly opened a small shop in Brunswick with his then girlfriend. After they split up, he continued to run the shop alone until he gave it up 18 months later, along with the adjacent apartment. Investigators have said Christian B. would only be questioned in connection with the Madeleine McCann case after the investigation is concluded, so that they could present him with the findings of the probe."

											Reenactment of child rape sparks anger										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/1946232/reenactment-of-child-rape-sparks-anger,"A Myanmar man who raped and choked a five-year-old girl to death in Tak province reenacted the assault yesterday amid tight police protection to prevent attacks from enraged bystanders. Mae Sot police yesterday took Sarim, 28, to the forest behind a Muslim community in Mae Sot district to carry out the reenactment of the crime. The girl's naked dead body was found on Saturday with wounds consistent with her having being tied with rope. Sarim was arrested the same day with the case enraging the community in Mae Sot district, a border town opposite Myanmar with many residents from the country. Many furious locals formed a crowd at the police station on Saturday and extra officers were deployed yesterday to ensure the reenactment could go ahead without disturbance. Police said Sarim had confessed to inviting the girl for a walk with him while he was under the influence of illegal drugs. He said he took the girl into a nearby patch of woods where he carried out the assault. He said he had not intended to kill the victim but his efforts to stifle her screams had resulted in her death. Sarim told police he had panicked and hid the body in bushes nearby before fleeing the scene. According to police, the suspect had served an eight-year sentence in jail for rape and murder before moving to work in Thailand. Pol Maj Gen Parinya Wisitdakul, chief of Tak provincial police, said the arrest had occurred after locals tipped off his officers about the likely culprit. Meanwhile, in Kanchanaburi, provincial police took Korakot Sukdee, 28, who had been arrested for raping a deaf-mute woman, 27, on June 28, to reenact the crime at a rental house in Muang district. According to investigators, the suspect had been released from prison in April after serving a sentence for theft."

2020-06-16 04:00:00,6,2020-06-16 04:00:00,Fighting a shadow pandemic,https://www.bangkokpost.com/life/social-and-lifestyle/1935600/fighting-a-shadow-pandemic,"Working from home during the height of Covid-19 was hell on earth for Bella*, a mother of two. Her abusive and alcoholic husband, whom she had been married to for a decade, had begun to physically and sexually violate her more now that she was working from home. The abuse often took place in front of the children, who were trying to keep up with schoolwork through remote learning. The abuse had become so severe that after an unprovoked altercation in the bedroom -- which left Bella with a broken nose -- paramedics were called by  neighbours to resuscitate her after they had been alerted by the couple's nine-year-old son who had found her on the bathroom floor with her nightgown drenched in blood. After recovering from her injuries, Bella opted to return to her abusive husband instead of going to a social welfare shelter because she feared getting infected with Covid-19. Bella's case is just one among many which demonstrates the rise in domestic violence incidents amid the coronavirus outbreak. Sadly, this is taking place not only in Thailand but across the globe. As a result of this unfortunate phenomenon, the 10th Asia Pacific Conference on Reproductive and Sexual Health Rights recently organised a discussion on the topic of ""Sexual and gender-based violence during Covid-19 in Asia and the Pacific regions"". At the event, panellists from Fiji, Tonga, Cambodia and Thailand shared how violence against women and children -- already a prevalent social problem in their individual communities -- had doubled in terms of reported cases amid the pandemic. While stats regarding the surge in violence against women and children are still scarce, news reports support the belief that there has been a significant increase in domestic violence as a result of the pandemic. Moreover, reports also seem to suggest that there has been a reduction in the number of survivors seeking support due to a combination of lockdown measures and/or women not opting to avail of health services due to fear of infection. A specialist for the UN Women Fiji Multi-Country Office for Ending Violence Against Women and Girls Programme, Abigail Erikson, stated that recent statistics show that last year alone, 243 million women and girls between 15 to 49 worldwide were subjected to sexual and physical violence by their intimate partner. The Pacific island countries have some of the highest recorded rates of sexual and gender-based violence, with nearly two out of three (67%) women experiencing sexual or physical violence by their partner. The violence is recurrent and severe and impacts women, girls, children, families and local communities at large. Public health measures adopted to fight the pandemic such as physical distancing and lockdown, she added, have confined people within their homes and added fuel to the fire. ""There has been an increase in calls to the national helpline numbers with 50% of women reporting a correlation between violence and some Covid-19 containment measure,"" Erikson said. ""Meanwhile, service providers have also reported that sexual and gender-based violence survivors who were already receiving support services have been experiencing more severe and more frequent violence. ""If we do not address the central drivers of gender inequality, violence and discrimination, then we are not going to deliver on the sustainable development goals [SDGs]. The money, resources and the political will that need to be put into addressing this issue should be unveiled against the backdrop of the pandemic and galvanise governments and civil society to direct all their efforts and resources into addressing all forms of such practices. If this happens, it would be a positive outcome of the pandemic."" Matcha Phorn-In, an ethnic minority lesbian feminist and founder of Sangsan Anakot Yawachon Development Project in Thailand, which works with marginalised and vulnerable members of society, remarked that due to increased travel restrictions, lockdown and home-­quarantine measures caused by Covid-19, there has been a rise in cases of sexual, physical and mental abuse, and gender-based violence in families she works with. The human rights defender said marginalised communities were already residing in crisis-like situations even prior to the pandemic. She described how a countless number of girls and women face poverty, discrimination and violation based on their ethnicity, stateless status, gender or sexual orientation. Meanwhile, the LGBTI community is also scared to seek public healthcare and/or other government services because homophobia and sexual discrimination hugely impacts their access to services. When Covid-19 struck, marginalised communities were hit the hardest, according to the executive director of the non-profit organisation. They ran out of food and were out of a job before others. Adding further insult to injury for the stateless and undocumented migrant workers and refugees living in Thailand without ID cards was that government aid during the pandemic was not available to them. This heightened their vulnerabilities. Matcha has made calls for safe access to abortion for all women; comprehensive sexual education in schools; legalisation of sex work; and laws to protect the rights of migrant workers, stateless people, sex workers and the LGBTI community. ""We need to change the system which fundamentally oppresses women,"" she said. ""This pandemic cannot be used as an excuse to stall progress made against sexual and gender-based violence. We require more engagement of women at the policy-making level and our government must listen to their voices to ensure an effective response to sexual and gender-based violence. ""In a culture such as ours which normalises domestic violence, the current Covid-19 measures have created an environment where women and children can become victims of abuse at the hands of a spouse or guardian more frequently because of the circumstances they are in."" While Thailand has not kept any statistics on this matter, social agencies have seen a drastic increase, Matcha explained. ""At recent engagements agencies such as the OSCC -- One Stop Crisis Center, or Social Help Center -- reported that the cases of domestic violence had doubled compared to the same time last year, while the Samaritans Thailand, a hotline for suicide prevention, have gone on record to say that they have found a three-fold increase in the number of callers, most of whom expressed concern over financial matters brought on due to Covid-19."" As for Cambodia, Dr Chivorn Var, executive director of the Reproductive Health Association of Cambodia (RHAC), said that confinement is likely to increase risks of partner violence as well as reduce access to regular lifesaving sexual and gender-based violence services. He said schools and most businesses in Cambodia had closed due to Covid-19 although it was not mandatory to stay at home. ""In Cambodia, we have laws, policies and programmes of action related to sexual and gender-based violence. We have to improve their implementation at the ground level through intersectoral coordination at the national and sub-national level. There is also a need to increase resources for continuity of care and lifesaving support and collection of age-specific data on gender issues."" Meanwhile, Ofa-Ki-Levuka Guttenbeil-Likiliki, director of the Women and Children Crisis Centre (WCCC), said that in Tonga, over 80% of sexual violence incidents, including child sexual abuse as well as rape and incest, happen within homes. ""Twenty-five percent of Tongan women have experienced either physical or sexual violence. But the majority of the support and response services -- like legal aid, safe houses or shelter homes, counselling services, sexual and reproductive health services -- for survivors of sexual and gender-based violence are on the main island. Women and children living in the five outer Tongan islands do not have direct access to these services."" Matcha added that addressing domestic and gender-based violence at its root is a must because, for one, the situation has reached a crisis point, with Thailand still lagging behind when it comes to making any tangible progress. She believes one of the reasons why men in general feel entitled to physically and sexually abusing women and children in Thailand is because of the mindset they have developed that the consequences of their actions will not get them into trouble.

											Man charged with rape of niece's 5-year-old daughter										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/1933100/man-charged-with-rape-of-nieces-5-year-old-daughter,"BURI RAM: A 43-year-old man has been arrested for the alleged rape of his niece's 5-year-old  daughter at his house in Khan Dong district. Local police took the man into custody after he surrendered to Khan Dong police on Wednesday, following a complaint by the girl’s mother, 26. She alleged that her uncle, her mother's younger brother, had raped her young daughter, police said. The 43-year-old suspect allegedly admitted having raped the girl. He said he called her in to play at his house around 11am on Monday. He took her to his bedroom, stripped the girl and then raped her. He said she had cried out in pain until he stopped 10 minutes later.  He said he raped the girl because his wife of 10 years had left him. He was lonely and drank heavily.  When he saw the girl on Monday he became aroused and so called her into his house.  Thai media reported the girl ran crying and bleeding from the house to her grandmother, and told her what happened. The woman took her grandchild to hospital for an examination, which confirmed the girl had been sexually abused. The girl's mother then filed a complaint against her uncle. The suspect was taken for a crime re-enactment on Thursday. He has been charged with four counts -  sexually abusing a minor aged below 13, performing an obscene act on a girl aged below 15, taking a girl aged below 15 for an obscene act, and depriving a girl aged below 15 of parental care. The man was due in court later on Thursday, when police would apply to detain him for another 12 days,  and oppose bail. "
2020-06-01 04:30:00,8,2020-06-01 04:30:00,Culture of rape,https://www.bangkokpost.com/life/social-and-lifestyle/1927492/culture-of-rape,"A recent rape case in Mukdahan province shocked the entire nation when it was brought to light that two underage female students were raped by five teachers and two school alumni. While the case was devastating on its own, it was all the more enraging when some netizens showed outright support to the perpetrators and shifted blame to the young victims. A teacher is generally a respected profession in the country. Even more so in rural areas where they play a role in the school and community. Thais are taught to be grateful to teachers for providing them with knowledge. The Mukdahan case has shone an unwanted spotlight on an ugly side of this profession, which experts see as an abuse of the power structure and patriarchy in our institutions and society. During a recent online panel discussion on the problem of rape and power, it was reported that about 50% of hundreds of rape and sexual violence attacks are on victims aged 11-20 years old, and that the perpetrators in about 5-10% of cases are teachers. These statistics were based on cases of rape and sexual violence as reported in the news from 2013-2017. But, as panellists pointed out, these numbers are much lower than what's really happening in society. ""This is a structural problem,"" said Varaporn Chamsanit, from the Women Wellbeing programme. ""It's not just about a child being unfortunate and running into bad teachers. These incidents are repeated over and over. However, we never get to know how prevalent it is in reality as some just don't get publicised. Many cases ended with both sides agreeing to a settlement. The perpetrators paid their way out. Some also married the victims."" Jaded Chouwilai, director of the Women and Men Progressive Movement Foundation, said the authoritarian nature within the bureaucratic system is held above the power of students who don't really have a say in what they want. The structure in educational institutions also gives power to teachers, not students. With their status, teachers are likely to know influential people, especially within rural communities, including policemen, leaders and local politicians, leading to many cases ending in a settlement. ""And when anything bad happens, people would automatically view that teachers -- believed to be virtuous by default -- would never do such a thing. Then, some just turn to attacking young victims instead,"" said Jaded. Children are bound to listen to teachers. And as they spend a lot of time together, a chance that teachers may abuse their power is also increased. ""In a way, it's a power bestowed from culture itself, which views that we are indebted to teachers. We don't respect them because of their individual knowledge, performance or behaviour. We just do for the fact that they are teachers, without considering much else. This mindset doesn't just affect children, but also their parents and people within the community,"" said Varaporn. Both Jaded and Varaporn said this rape epidemic is related to the patriarchy. ""Thai culture gives more freedom to men when it comes to sex, and urges and coerces them to be experienced. They cheat, have mistresses and pay people for sex, and society sort of compromises that it's acceptable to do so. But women are controlled and taught not to be promiscuous,"" said Varaporn. Jaded added that rape incidents happen everywhere with shared factors, including the inability to restrain oneself and the tendency to exercise and abuse one's power. Alcohol also plays a role as a catalyst. Whenever a rape case is reported, fingers are often pointed at female victims. The way they dress, the time they choose to commute, and even the place they happen to be at have become reasons for people to conclude that the victims were asking for trouble. With the Mukdahan case, social media erupted when a post made by a fellow teacher cheered for the perpetrators and expressed concerns for their wives and family, while saying the students were ungrateful for making the rape public. ""If you don't want your children to be raped by teachers, then just get them homeschooled,"" stated the Facebook post. Varaporn said that for people to show support for rapists and condemn victims, it shows that they accept violence and, in turn, support rape. ""It's like they're joining the perpetrators in raping and hurting victims again,"" she said. Thicha Na Nakorn, adviser of the Foundation for Children, Youth and Family, said that she has met with the victims of the Mukdahan case. They, too, have been attacked by their own peers for humiliating the school in their decision to expose the teachers' crimes. Thicha wished to see the Minister of Education himself visit the victims and show admiration for their courage in bringing this story to light. This is to discourage the rapists' supporters, while ensuring society that justice will be served. In previous rape cases, Thicha said victim blaming was common, which then harms the victim's self-esteem. She said that it's crucial to empower victims as it also influences their fight to prosecute the perpetrators. ""Empowering can be about changing the goal that the victims aren't fighting only for themselves and their family. A victim in a past rape case has said that she must've been chosen by the higher power. She doesn't want to see this happening to others, which was why she chose to proceed with the case. This is an empowered mindset,"" said Thicha. ""The process of empowerment can change a person from surrendering to being brave. They have a choice whether to stop or to go on,"" she said. If the victims choose to fight, Thicha said that the social mechanism must not isolate them and must accommodate and protect them during the entire process. In her experience, she has seen both civil society organisations and state agencies co-operating to help these victims. ""If state agencies can view civil society organisations as allies, we can recognise our individual strengths and work together to help people,"" said Thicha. The three panellists called for the Ministry of Education to take this issue seriously. Some of their suggestions include for schools to change their evaluation system and allow students, parents and the community be the ones who evaluate their own teaching staff. Thicha said students should be taught and empowered about their own rights at the school. ""If children know and can think for themselves, no teacher would be able to make silly threats like not giving them points or failing them in class [to force them to do things],"" said Thicha. Education Minister Nataphol Teepsuwan responded to the rape case by establishing a centre to protect students who have been sexually violated, with Hotline 1579 available to help victims. Jaded questioned the practicality of this centre and the hotline, suggesting that this mechanism needs to be a neutral space and should involve members from civil society organisations and academics to prevent the perpetrators from being helped by their own people. The panellists also agreed that the centre is only fixing problems at the end. In a campaign on Change.org, over 8,000 people have requested the Ministry of Education to join the victims as complainant against the perpetrators to protect the welfare of students. The petition was supported by a network of 92 organisations that protect women and children in Thailand. The campaign also asks for severe disciplinary actions for those who are found guilty, and asks the ministry to come up with preventive measures and to educate teachers about child's protection and gender equality. The online petition has since been submitted to the Minister of Education."

											Checks on teachers for past abuse										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/1924064/checks-on-teachers-for-past-abuse,"Education Minister Nataphol Teepsuwan on Monday ordered the Office of the Teacher Civil Service and Educational Personnel Commission (OTEPC) to make sure that no teachers or school executives who have been convicted of child sexual abuse offences are able to return to the profession in any capacity. The move follows a school gang rape case in Mukdahan's Muang district early this month. Five teachers at a school in the area were suspended after being charged in connection with the repeated sexual assault of a 14-year-old girl. Two school alumni were also accused of having taken part, and all are said to have taken video clips of the acts. Amporn Pinasa, the OTEPC secretary-general, said yesterday a survey by her office found that about 180 teachers and school executives have been convicted of child sexual abuse over the past three years and all had been suspended or sacked. Ms Amporn said these convicted teachers have already had their teaching licences revoked and would not be able to reapply for work at a school. Nevertheless, she said her office would make details of the offenders available on a nationally accessible database to ensure that there are no loopholes that these offenders can take advantage of to find work where children might be present. The OTEPC chief also said she had been asked to conduct a study into what drove these teachers to commit child sex abuse crimes as well introduce better screening across all areas of teacher procurement and training to make sure that no individuals with a propensity for this type of crime slip through the net in the future. Ms Amporn added that in her experience the best teachers were not always the most knowledgable but often the ones who care the most about the wellbeing of their students and her office would do its best to make sure that trainee teachers who exhibit these characteristics would be fast-tracked into positions in schools across the country. She added that making sure that schools are ""safe spaces for students"" must be a national priority going forward."

											School sex abuse cases spark alarm										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/special-reports/1923208/school-sex-abuse-cases-spark-alarm,"The three child sexual abuses cases which have taken place this month are clearly a wake-up call for all stakeholders to come up with better prevention methods. The latest case, of repeated gang rape in Mukdahan's Muang district earlier this month, was the most disturbing. Thais were shocked to learn the seven suspects were five teachers and two alumni from a public school. They were charged with allegedly raping two student girls aged 14 and 16. According to the police, the suspects first assaulted the victims in March 2019 and carried on at least six times until March this year. Some of the attacks even took place inside the school premises. The suspects denied the charges and were released on bail of 200,000 baht each. Another child abuse case took place in Chumphon's Pathiu district. A 32-year-old music teacher was accused of raping a 12-year-old female student at a resort. The father of the girl lodged a complaint against the teacher who denied the allegation. Another child abuse case occurred in Buri Ram's Ban Dan district when a 39-year-old teacher was arrested on charges of performing obscene acts on a 12-year-old student. He has admitted groping, but denied having sex with her. These alleged child sexual cases have gained significant public attention, raised concerns about the lack of protection for children in schools and prompted calls on the authorities involved to reinforce their efforts to prevent sexual harassment in schools. The Bangkok Post talked to a variety of stakeholders including educators, child experts, policymakers, police and criminologists, asking them how the problem can be dealt with, particularly the school gang rape case in Mukdahan. RESPONSIVE SCHOOLS Chulalongkorn University's education expert Athapol Anunthavorasakul said the cases represent a failure to protect children and should serve as a strong wake-up call to society to protect children better. ""Schools must be safe havens for children and no child should suffer from any form of violence in schools. Teachers must be the ones who protect children in their care, not the ones who harm them,"" he said. Mr Athapol said the supportive comments made by colleagues of the suspects also show how nepotism comes first in the Thai school system, not teachers' professional ethics nor morality. ""These men were sexually exploiting their students and treated the school as a brothel for over a year, yet their superiors and colleagues thought nothing was wrong with it. ""It is impossible that nobody knew about it, but nepotism made other teachers turn the other way. Had it not been for the fierce anger from the public, these men might have been spared by the school's nepotism again,"" he said. Mr Athapol said although most Thai schools have a student affairs division to provide support to students outside the classroom, many lack accessible and child-sensitive complaint mechanisms for students who are sexually abused. ""Most students who are victims of sexual violence don't know who they can turn to. They are afraid their complaints may not be taken seriously and fear reprisals. They need someone or a channel they can trust,'' he said. Mr Athapol said confidential reporting channels should be established in all schools and staff and students alike must know how to use them. Schools should also have clear referral pathways to social welfare agencies and work with multidisciplinary teams to provide support to survivors of violence and abuse. Teachers and other school staff can play an important role in preventing sexual harassment before it takes place by observing children, watching for signs of violence, abuse and neglect and reporting it when they have concerns, he added. ""Teachers should make a list of students in their classes who are vulnerable and at greater risk of sexual abuse such as those come from broken homes or live with step-parents or a single parent. More importantly, they must dare to stand up for victims even if the abusers are school staff members or their co-workers,"" he said. According to the Office of Basic Education Commission's Student Protection Centre, 624 student sexual assault cases were reported to the centre over the past five years. Out of these, 76 cases were committed by teachers or school staff. ''I'm certain that the true number is larger since so much of the problem goes unreported,'' Mr Athapol said. The expert also warned schools not to focus on protecting girls as sexual assaults can happen to anyone. Boys and LGBT children can fall victim to sexual predators as well. ""Boys and LGBT children have many of the same feelings and reactions as other survivors of sexual assault, but they may also face some additional challenges because of social attitudes and stereotypes about men and masculinity,'' he said. Child rights advocate Ticha Na Nakorn has called on the Education Ministry to rehabilitate the education system by reforming the spirit of the profession. She was referring to the case of the school gang rape by five teachers in Mukdahan. ""I do not come out in public to attack this profession because there are still decent teachers about. The challenge is how to help these good teachers and whistleblowers protect children,"" said Ms Ticha. The Justice Ministry is mulling compensating the victims by 110,000 baht each, while child psychologists from the Ministry of Social Development and Human Security have provided counselling. The 16-year-old victim, who is also a witness in the case of the 14-year-old, has been placed in the care of a Justice Ministry facility in Mukdahan province. COMPLAINT CENTRES Education Minister Nataphol Teepsuwan said he has ordered a complaint centre set up at the ministry for students to report any sexual misconduct by their teachers. He also instructed provincial officers to probe the school's director for possible negligence. The five teachers among the accused were immediately suspended and their licences revoked, Mr Nataphol said. ""This is a serious offence and I will not tolerate it. School is a second home to students. If the place is unsafe because of a teacher's behaviour, I have to put an end to it,"" the minister said. ""Under my watch, there will be no more transfers to inactive posts,"" he added. ""Every offender will be immediately fired."" UNICEF STEPS IN Unicef has called on the Ministry of Education to consider a review of protection measures, monitoring mechanisms and response protocols. ""The review, in partnership with professional bodies such as the Teachers' Council of Thailand, can also help in strengthening the code of conduct for teachers and other education staff, further ensure these codes are effectively implemented, and appropriate sanctions applied,"" it said. Teacher training curricula and professional development opportunities should include training about the causes of school-related violence and abuse, prevention activities, referral and response frameworks and ethical conduct."

											Blind trust 'can lead kids to peril'										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/1923156/blind-trust-can-lead-kids-to-peril,"The experts are saying it is uncommon for children to distrust those they are close to, but within the context of sexual abuse, this may be the best way to save them from life-long trauma. Up to 93.5% of 170 men convicted of sex crimes against minors admitted their victims were targeted because they were family members or someone close, Pol Maj Gen Jirabhop Bhuridej, chief of the Crime Suppression Division, told the Bangkok Post. He said these men were fathers, uncles and teachers of the victims. He was citing a study called Applying situational principles to sexual offenses against children by Richard Wortley and Stephen Smallbone. In the study, suspected abusers are labelled ""fixated sex offenders,"" who do not feel guilty about developing intimate relationships with children. Jirabhop: Cites overseas crime study Pol Maj Gen Jiraphop added that men who abuse children are likely to be repeat offenders in other types of sexual crimes. Sex offenders often find building interpersonal relationships with adults difficult and feel more comfortable around children, according to the study. Pol Maj Gen Jirabhop also said the study highlighted how sex offenders use tricks to lure children, noting aggressive offenders enjoy seeing children in pain. The CSD said 95 rape suspects were arrested by the division last year, including a man who raped his 12-year-old stepdaughter, took photos of his act and shared them in a chat group. It said earlier this year police had arrested a man who befriended a 13-year-old girl on Facebook before luring her for sex. The suspect had been on the run for six years until he was arrested in April. Pol Maj Gen Jirabhop said the tactics used in these cases are similar to those in the study. He said the suspects knew the victims well and knew how to build trust with minors. ""Don't trust anybody even if they are teachers,"" said Atchariya Ruangrattanaphong, chairman of the Help Crime Victims Club (HCVC). ""They can commit crime when they are alone with students."" Recently, a case surfaced involving five teachers in Mukdahan province who allegedly raped two students. The HCVC receives an average of five cases per year, but Mr Atchariya said there are many cases out there as many victims have been threatened against telling their parents about the crimes. Those found guilty of sexually assaulting a minor can be jailed for up to 20 years and fined up to 400,000 baht. But this may not be enough to deter criminals. Kritsanaphong: Warns cooperation is needed ""Rapists tend to repeat the offence, even after being discharged from prison,"" said Pol Lt Col Kritsanaphong Phutrakun, an assistant rector at Rangsit University and expert at the in criminology and criminal justice administration. Psychiatrists and police officers must cooperate to solve the problem, but it would be better if children ""learn not to trust people easily,"" he said."

Under the revised law, adults who have sex with under-16-year-olds will be prosecuted for child sexual abuse or rape regardless of any alleged consent. Previously, teenagers aged 13 or older were held to be legally capable of consenting to sex, resulting in controversial cases and critics saying that sex offenders were escaping without punishment due to the low benchmark. In 2017, a 42-year-old man was found not guilty of raping a then 15-year-old on the grounds she had consented, provoking outrage and calls for the age limit to be raised. Despite its economic and technological advances, South Korea remains a traditional and patriarchal society, where victims of sexual assault have been shamed for coming forward. The age of consent was raised to 16 in order to ""protect teenagers from sex crimes at a fundamental level"", the South's Justice Ministry said in a statement. The amended law also eliminated statutes of limitation for sexual crimes against minors under 13."

The three teachers are Wipoj Saensuk, Anupap Banjong and Yutthana Phuthanonnok, according to Pol Lt Col Preecha Krongyut, the inspector at Phueng Daet police station overseeing the case. Although the teachers have been accused of organising the gang rape and asked others to join in, they will not be charged with human trafficking, said Pol Lt Col Preecha. The 16-year-old victim, a student at the same school, is serving as a witness in the first gang rape case against a 14-year-old girl. The teenager said she had been raped by some of the suspects accused in the other case and the information she had provided corroborated that given by the first victim. As of now, the second reported victim has been placed into the custody of the ministry of Social Development and Human Security. Sirikarn Klongdee, the child psychologist caring for her said the girl was under an extreme amount of stress following her ordeal. She has been given sedatives and psychological counseling, said Ms Sirikarn, adding that while the girl does not come from a poor family, her parents are divorced. Both victims were reportedly raped on a number of occasions over a one-year period starting in March 2019. The alleged gang rape case sparked national outrage when the grandmother of the 14-year-old girl filed a criminal complaint last week. So far, police had pressed charges against five teachers and two male alumni. All have denied the charges against them and requested bail, which was granted.

Local media followed him and interviewed Manit Promdee, 77, his uncle who was shocked at the allegations against his nephew. Mr Manit described his nephew as ""polite man who couldn't harm a soul"". The uncle also told local media that Mr Anupap had told him that he had joined a party where the suspects drank alcohol together and met the girls. He said his nephew denies, however, sexually assaulting them. Meanwhile, police investigators scoured four sites connected with the alleged crimes -- the school gym, the volleyball court, the teacher rooms and their private residences. Pol Lt Col Preecha said they had recovered used condoms and a number of empty liquor bottles. He said the police are prepared to take the victims and witnesses into protective custody in the event of witness intimidation. Somsak Thepsutin, Minister of Justice, said officials from the ministry were already accompanying the victims and witnesses for their security. Both victims are also eligible to receive 110,00 baht each -- 40,000 baht for medical treatment, 20,000 for mental anguish and 50,000 for punitive damages."

											World standing by as children harmed by conflict: charity										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/1857489/world-standing-by-as-children-harmed-by-conflict-charity,"LONDON - Governments were on Thursday urged to do more to protect children from the effects of war and serious violence, after a new report suggested record numbers were living in a conflict zone. Save the Children said wars were becoming more dangerous for children, with youngsters facing an increased risk of death and injury, being recruited by armed groups or sexual abuse. ""It's staggering that the world stands by while children are targeted with impunity,"" the charity's chief executive Inger Ashing said in a statement to accompany the report. ""Since 2005, at least 95,000 children were recorded to have been killed or maimed, tens of thousands of children abducted, and millions of children denied access to education or health services after their hospitals were attacked."" Ashing warned that ""the destruction of children's lives"" will continue if nothing is done and those responsible for crimes are not brought to account. - Record numbers - The report said nearly one in six children around the world -- some 415 million children -- were living in a conflict zone in 2018, more than double the figure recorded in 1995. Incidents of ""grave violations"" against them had risen by  170 percent since 2010, the ""Stop the War on Children"" study found. African children were the worst affected, with 170 million living in war zones, although a higher proportion were hit in the Middle East, where almost one in three were surrounded by conflict.  The report also found record numbers of children being subjected to grave violations: killing and maiming; recruitment by armed forces; abduction; attacks on schools or hospitals; denial of humanitarian access; and rape and other forms of sexual violence. For individual countries, the situation was worst in Afghanistan followed by Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iraq and Mali. Different threats faced by boys and girls was analysed for the first time.  ""Girls are at far higher risk of sexual and other forms of gender-based violence, including child, early and forced marriage,"" the study found. ""Boys are much more likely to be exposed to killing and maiming, abductions and recruitment,"" it added. - Kidnapping, child soldiers - Victims from both genders recounted their experiences in the report, including Samira, a 15-year-old Yazidi girl from Iraq who is mother to a two-year-old child.  She was kidnapped with her mother and sisters in 2016, kept in captivity and sold to at least three people who beat and sexually assaulted her. She was then forced into marriage with an Islamic State fighter and gave birth, returning home while her child remained under the care of authorities in Syria.  ""I would prefer to stay in slavery and live in camps my whole life rather than leave my child,"" she was quoted as saying. ""I did not want to leave her to live without (her) mother or to live the life that I lived. I wanted to give her the rights that I have been denied as a child."" Another recounted how a young boy called Peter was recruited by an armed group in South Sudan before escaping to Uganda.  ""They gave us weapons for shooting,"" he said. ""They trained you how to load a gun, how to put in the bullet and release the trigger for the gun to shoot. ""My heart was happy when I arrived in Uganda,"" he added.  ""I saw schools and hospitals. I was excited and said, 'this is the place where you can at least study and get medication whenever you are sick'."""

											Man charged with raping five-year-old girl at US embassy in Delhi										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/1852734/man-charged-with-raping-five-year-old-girl-at-us-embassy-in-delhi,"NEW DELHI - An Indian man has been charged with raping a five-year-old girl on the premises of the US embassy in India's capital New Delhi, police said Thursday. The 25-year-old was arrested at the high-security compound on Sunday a day after the alleged incident at the living quarters for local housekeeping staff. Police officer Yogesh Kumar told AFP preliminary medical tests confirmed the girl had been raped. The man was charged under child rape laws that carry the death penalty. The sprawling diplomatic compound is one of the most secure in Delhi, with multiple layers of manned and electronic security.  A US Embassy spokesperson in New Delhi said Friday that it was ""deeply disturbed"" by the allegations and it took ""prompt action"" including reporting the incident to the police and helping arrange medical assistance. ""We are cooperating with the Indian-led investigation. We extend our sympathy and full support to the child and her family,"" the spokesperson said in a statement. India is struggling to combat a growing number of sexual assault cases in the country. Violence against women in the South Asian nation has been under the international spotlight following the brutal gang-rape and murder of a Delhi student on a bus in 2012. Almost 34,000 rapes were reported in 2018, according to official data, with activists claiming the figure is just the tip of the iceberg. Experts said most child victims are known to their abusers, with their families frequently choosing not to report the crimes to authorities amid social taboos against speaking out."

Men, women and children can all end up behind bars for committing criminal acts. Ignorance of the law is no excuse. Many jurists advocate that laws be reconsidered periodically to determine whether they are still applicable. Some turn into the Blue Laws of yore, still on the books but no longer enforced. Others get overturned. One More LieAmy Lloyd Arrow389ppAvailable at Asia Books and leading bookshops315 baht A case in point is the banning of alcohol in the US in 1920. So many people broke that law that it was finally rescinded 13 years later. Marijuana laws have similarly been criticised. The prevailing attitudes appear to be changing. Time will tell. Even with so many laws being revised, perpetrators of serious crimes like robbery, rape and murder still fill prisons. Devil worship, human trading and sacrifices are so horrific that they are played down by the media, their adherents labelled ""evil"". The citizenry is so irate at the blood lust of those arrested that they want to tear them apart. Yet what if the evil ones are children themselves? Do they deserve leniency? In One More Lie by Welsh writer Amy Lloyd, age is taken into consideration, but it's not just a tap on the wrist. Charlotte, who as a preteen is involved in the horrific murder of another child, gets a new identity, psychiatric counselling and a band around her ankle to monitor her movements. Finally, at the age of 28, she is deemed fit to re-enter society and gets a job in customer relations. She has not had any contact with Sean, her partner in crime, since the incident 17 years before. Heavy on psychology, the plot is about Charlotte trying to adjust to her newfound freedom, such as it is. A spanner is thrown in the works when Sean tries to re-establish contact. She refuses him. For her, it was a one-time thing. But it has branded her. Awake or asleep, she can think of nothing else. The action is set in Wales and Scotland. Lloyd doesn't look at the locals through rose-tinted glasses. They, the ones her protagonist meets at least, are rather short-tempered, rarely polite. One constable is a decent fellow, the other isn't. Her shrink writes to her, but doesn't give her patient her return address. The story has no ending as such. Charlotte does her job and has her memories. She wonders how Sean is doing, yet has no intention of ever meeting him again. Life goes on. Critics have praised One More Lie as superb, thought-provoking, well-worth reading, etc. I question whether you will enjoy perusing it in one sitting. This reviewer has read many books in one sitting, but this isn't one of them. Charlotte is more a sympathetic than a likeable character. Then again, their childhood crime can't be condoned. As Dostoevsky pointed out, laws are about crime and punishment. The criminal justice system specifies how much jail time be accorded for the felonies and misdemeanours committed. Defence lawyers plead mitigating circumstances to lessen the severity of the verdict. Prosecutors are determined to throw the book at the defendant. Elevator PitchLinwood BarclayHQ455ppAvailable at Asia Books and leading bookshops550 baht Which is where motive plays a major part. The defence will try to make it appear as if the defendant had compelling reasons. To the prosecutor, this will be irrelevant; the act speaks for itself. To be sure, motives do greatly vary. Having had abusive parents is a common one. This warps a child's concept of human relationships. Blind jealousy is another common motive, as an infuriated wife or husband learns their spouse has betrayed their marriage vows. Then there's the co-ed who killed and chopped up her classmate for coming on to her best friend's boyfriend. Or what of the gunman massacring a crowd, claiming he's a political activist? Vengeance is in a class of its own, because it applies to countries as well as individuals. Countries that have lost a war and, with it, possessions and/or territory, often look for an excuse to wage a new war to redress the balance. Individuals may harbour thoughts of vengeance for wrongs, real or imagined, done to them or their loved ones. Crime thriller novelists are particularly fond of this variety. US author Linwood Barclay has a go in Elevator Pitch. Set in Manhattan, it focuses on its ubiquitous skyscrapers, filled with offices and thousands upon thousands of people coming and going every day. In the The classic film The Towering Inferno a packed skyscraper catches fire. Not all survived. We don't even need fiction to imagine such scenarios; the 9/11 suicide attacks on the Twin Towers left around 3,000 dead. In Elevator Pitch the scrivener zeros in on the lifts; regardless of the floor button pressed, it shoots to the top, then plummets to the bottom, fatal to all aboard. A tragic, inexplicable accident. Or is it? When it happens again the next day, the media starts asking questions. The third such crash a day later shuts down the offices. A body is found with its hands cut off, delaying identification. Elevator inspectors and the NYPD find other means to reach the top. Sure enough, the gear had been sabotaged. Why? There's an intense investigation, a journalist at the forefront. It all adds up to not very much."
