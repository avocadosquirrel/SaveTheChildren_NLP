											Pandemic of abuse										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/1958095/pandemic-of-abuse,"Stay-at-home and lockdown measures have helped to contain the greatest public-health threat the world has seen in decades. But as Covid-19 receded in many countries, a new public-health crisis was emerging behind closed doors, with increased domestic violence against women and children. With people stuck at home and schools closed, it has become harder to tap the usual sources of support such as friends, extended family or professionals, leaving victims unable to seek and obtain help, say health professionals. Stress occurring during the pandemic and economic instability have also been catalysts that exacerbate the risk of violence, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Data compiled by the WHO showed that even in normal times, almost one in three women worldwide report experiencing physical and/or sexual violence by their partner or sexual violence by someone else in their lifetime. The UN Population Fund (UNFPA), meanwhile, estimated in May that if lockdowns continue for six months, an extra 31 million cases of gender-based violence could be expected globally. ""Often abused women and children are afraid to talk because of fear or shame. This 'window' to speak up and seek help is, during confinement, even more restricted,"" says Mariya Gabriel, the European Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth. ""As a matter of fact, in some countries, we have seen an increase in reports of domestic violence since the outbreak of Covid-19."" Najat Maalla M'jid, special representative of the UN Secretary-General for Violence against Children, shared the same view, adding that ""confinement measures and the disrupted provision of already limited child protection services exacerbated the vulnerability of children to various forms of violence"". CHILD VICTIMS Violence against children, according to the WHO, encompasses all forms of violence including abuse and neglect occurring to children under 18 years of age. It can be physical and/or emotional ill-treatment, sexual abuse, neglect, or other exploitation, which results in actual or potential harm to the child's health, survival and development. The health agency's Global Status Report on Preventing Violence Against Children 2020, released last month, shed light on the prevalence of violence against children. It estimated that 300 million children -- nearly three out of four worldwide -- aged two to four years old regularly suffer physical punishment and/or psychological violence at the hands of parents and caregivers. Moreover, one in five women and one in 13 men report having been sexually abused as a child (before age 17), while 120 million girls and young women under age 20 have suffered some form of forced sexual contact. Child maltreatment often leaves serious life-long consequences. Physically, maltreatment causes stress associated with disruption in early brain development. Extreme stress can impair the development of the nervous and immune systems. Maltreated children, when they enter adulthood, are at increased risk for behavioural, physical and mental health problems such as perpetrating or being a victim of violence, depression, smoking, high-risk sexual behaviours, unintended pregnancy, alcohol and drug abuse, according to the report. The abused person is also more likely to become an abuser once they grow up. Therefore, violence is often passed down from one generation to the next, perpetuating a vicious cycle. More alarmingly, the health agency also documented that every year, there are an estimated 40,150 homicides in children under 18 years of age, some of which are likely linked to maltreatment. The agency, however, said that a significant proportion of deaths due to child maltreatment are often incorrectly attributed to falls, burns, drowning and other causes. Even though causes of maltreatment vary, the report emphasises that it is important to emphasise that children are the victims and are never to blame. The report shows that characteristics of an individual child that may increase the likelihood of being maltreated include ""being either under four years old or an adolescent, being unwanted, having special needs, having abnormal physical features, having an intellectual disability or neurological disorder, and identifying as or being identified as LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender)"", among others. The economic costs of the lifetime consequences of violence against children are also severe: In the United States alone, the WHO estimated, the costs amount to US$228 billion per year. To tackle the problem head-on, it's necessary to break the cycle of violence to create positive multi-generational impacts, by preventing child maltreatment before it begins. This requires an approach involving multiple parties. Effective prevention approaches, according to the WHO, include supporting parents and teaching positive parenting skills and enhancing laws to prohibit violent punishment. The global community has made some progress in addressing the issue. The good news is that 89% of countries have multiple sectors responsible for addressing violence against children, while 80% reported having at least one national action plan to prevent violence against children. The less encouraging news is that only 47% of countries said these plans, laws and rules were being strongly enforced. There is also a need to develop a quality education to empower children, allowing them to acquire knowledge, skills and experiences that build resilience and reduce risk factors for violence. Further, a systemic shift in restrictive and harmful gender and social norms around child-rearing, child discipline and gender equality are required. Governments play a central role in this endeavour. To put an end to violence against children, the report suggests governments strengthen their legislative framework, having laws that prohibit all forms of violence against children, and ensure that they have agencies with a mandate and appropriate resources to coordinate action to end violence against children. The report also suggests governments prioritise data collection on key violence-related indicators and use these to set measurable targets in national action plans. ONLINE ABUSE School closures as part of government lockdown measures have affected some 1.5 billion children worldwide. With the closures, online communities have played an important part in maintaining learning, support and play for many children. However, an increase in harmful online behaviour including cyberbullying, risky online behaviour and sexual exploitation have also been identified. From Asia to Europe, cases of online child sexual abuse have soared as children spend more time online, making them more vulnerable to abusers as Covid-19 gave predators access to new groups of children who before the lockdown didn't spend as much time online. In Australia, police warned that ""insidious"" online predators were targeting new victims after a surge in coronavirus infections put Melbourne under partial lockdown. During the earlier lockdown, traffic to websites hosting online child sexual abuse content skyrocketed and such material posted to the dark web doubled, said the police. ""We suspect that offenders will use this second wave of Covid-19 as an opportunity to find more potential child victims, as young people spend an increasing amount of time online with limited adult supervision,"" Australian Federal Police Commander Jamie Strauss said. In Australia, child exploitation has been on the rise in recent years. Nearly 22,000 cases were reported between July 2019 and June 2020, up by almost 50% from a year ago, official figures show. Lockdowns have also led to the rise another insidious activity: bullying and cyberbullying. Even before the lockdown, the United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef) ranked bullying among the top concerns of children. The issue is widespread throughout the world, affecting a significant percentage of children as victims, perpetrators or bystanders. In a 2019 Unesco report, Behind the Numbers: Ending School Violence and Bullying, bullying is highlighted a major problem worldwide, with 32% of students aged 11 to 15 bullied by their peers at school at least once in the last month. In a poll conducted by Unicef in 2019, more than a third of young people in 30 countries report being a victim of online bullying. Cyberbullying, which involves the posting or sending of messages, pictures or videos, aimed at harassing, threatening or targeting another person. Although the prevalence of cyberbullying is low compared with other forms of school violence and bullying, it is an increasing problem and is on the rise during the pandemic. ""During the Covid-19 pandemic, and the related school closures, we have seen a rise in violence and hate online - and this includes bullying. Now, as schools begin to reopen, children are expressing their fears about going back to school,"" said Unesco director-general Audrey Azoulay. To prevent bullying, legislation is needed to safeguard the rights of children and underpin policies to prevent and respond to school violence and bullying, train and support teachers to prevent and respond to school violence and bullying. There is also a need to empower victims by providing information and support to children to enable them to speak up and seek help. ABUSE IN SPORT Sport is another area where child abuse has long been prevalent, but where victims have been afraid to speak out until recently. Young people, especially those who aspire to become high-performance athletes, spend as much of their time around coaches as they do with their families and are often targets of exploitation or worse. A Human Rights Watch (HRW) report published this month, which documented the experiences of more than 800 athletes in 50 sports, found that in Japan, child athletes often suffer physical and verbal abuse and sometimes sexual abuse during training. The report titled ""I Was Hit So Many Times I Can't Count"": Abuse of Child Athletes in Japan, exposed a toxic culture in Japanese sport, which involves the use of physical violence as a coaching technique. Such practices are seen as essential to achieving excellence in competition and in personal character. Many child athletes had been punched, kicked or experienced verbal abuse, while others reported being ordered to eat excessively, denied water or told to train even when injured. The ""tradition"" makes eradicating physical abuse in sport hard because coaches, parents and some players believe that there's value in physical abuse. Abusive coaching techniques documented in the report include, but are not limited to, hitting children with bats or bamboo kendo sticks, slapping children, and simulated drowning. In 2013, the Japanese Olympic Committee (JOC), promised to take steps to eradicate violence among its sports federations after an internal survey revealed more than 10% of its athletes had been victims of bullying or harassment. However, the watchdog said that not enough had been done since then and demanded organisations such as the Japan Sports Council and the JOC use the upcoming Olympics as a catalyst for change. The watchdog's national director, Kanae Doi, said that even though child abuse in sports today is a global problem, the organisation chose to focus on Japan for 2020 because the Olympics and Paralympics will be held in Japan. Young athletes are often afraid to report abuse largely because Japanese culture emphasises respecting elders, leaving violent coaches to continue their harassment, said Takuya Yamazaki, a sports lawyer who worked on the HRW report. But Japan is not unique in this domain. In South Korea, the story of Choi Suk-hyeon, a promising triathlete who committed suicide in June, also exposed the culture of malpractice in the country. The story broke when Choi's family released a diary and secret recordings in which the young triathlete documented years of physical and psychological abuse that she said she suffered at the hands of her team's coach, doctor and two senior teammates. The diaries and recordings have set off a firestorm of criticism about the corruption and abuse that critics say has long pervaded the South Korean sports community. South Korea has slowly emerged as a global sports powerhouse, with its athletes winning Olympic gold medals and other prizes. But recurring scandals have revealed widespread physical violence, sexual assault and other forms of abuse against athletes, many of whom are young, vulnerable and live away from their families during training."
1,2020-01-20 04:31:00,An imbalance of power,https://www.bangkokpost.com/life/social-and-lifestyle/1839504/an-imbalance-of-power,"After K-pop singer Lalisa Manoban, better known as Lisa, of the famous girl group Blackpink visited MQQN Cafe in Bangkok, its owner thought everything she touched would turn to gold. He started posting photos of Lisa on the cafe's Facebook page, bragging that someone wanted to buy a sofa on which the sexy star sat, before saying he in fact wasn't satisfied with the price offered. Then he joked about selling other things Lisa used during her visit, such as a glass, a spoon, a napkin and even a toilet seat. Last month, fans of the K-pop singer expressed their fury as they thought the comments posted by the cafe owner were inappropriate and were considered cyberbullying and harassment. The fans attacked the cafe on Facebook and created a Twitter trend, #LowClassMQQNCafe, which was used worldwide. The owner decided to post his apology to Lisa's fans while also telling them to calm down and that he didn't harass Lisa at all. After his ignorance, the cafe's Facebook page received lots of criticism. He eventually accepted his guilt and apologised to Lisa and her fans. The cafe has reportedly shut down indefinitely since the incident. This is just the latest case of sexual harassment that happens in a patriarchal society where many people -- including the MQQN Cafe owner and his friends -- don't even realise their actions constitute sexual harassment. This happens in part because Thai men have grown up with the attitude that they can express their sexual desires openly, said Jaded Chouwilai, director of the Women and Men Progressive Movement Foundation (WMP). ""Men are allowed to go to prostitutes when they have sexual desires. They haven't been trained to restrain themselves from their sexual drives and it becomes a problem. As boys, they like to lift the skirts of girls and tease them. When they grow up, they like to tease and wolf-whistle pretty women, and think it is something normal,"" Jaded said. In terms of international law, Jaded said that sexual harassment is a significant issue. ""Sexual harassment starts with whistling, staring, leering and unwelcome verbal conduct. Some men have the misperception that if he keeps approaching a woman, she will like him. There are cases of men getting closer to women to make plans to rape them,"" he added. Lalisa Manoban, better known as Lisa, from K-pop band Blackpink. Photo © lalalalisa_m : Instagram With this kind of attitude, lots of Thai women have encountered sexual harassment. According to a 2017 survey of about 1,600 public-transportation passengers by the Safe Cities for Women Network, one in three people experience sexual harassment while on public transport. Women, who accounted for around 45% of respondents, were harassed the most. LGBTI was the next group, followed by men. The unwelcome conduct that victims experienced most was looking under skirts or staring at their breasts (18.8%). Touching, leaning and cornering victims took second place (15.4%). Next was whistling at victims (13.9%). And uninvited or unwanted flirting was fourth (13.1%). Unfortunately, only 28% of the sexually harassed reported it to the police, while 12% chose to ignore the situation and walked away. Since we live in a male-dominated society, sexual harassment is treated like it isn't a serious issue. It is a misdemeanour charge. Asst Prof Tanawut Wonganan from the Faculty of Law, Valaya Alongkorn Rajabhat University under Royal Patronage, mentioned the case of Lisa on his Facebook page. He posted the definition of sexual harassment provided by the Royal Institute Dictionary's Psychology Vocabulary, saying it means any actions including leering, unwelcome sexual statements or other harassment that troubles, annoys or causes psychogenic pain. Tanawut posted that sexual harassment has a misdemeanour charge according to an amendment to Section 397 of the criminal code. ""Any actions that tend to be sexual harassment shall be liable to imprisonment for not longer than one month or a fine not exceeding 10,000 baht, or both,"" he posted. When it comes to sexual harassment, unwelcome verbal conduct or an unwanted action can be interpreted several ways. Naiyana Supapung, director of the Teeranat Kanjanauksorn Foundation (TKF), which promotes gender equality, explained that sexual harassment cases are different from others. ""When looking at a criminal case, we focus on the intent of an attacker. In a sexual harassment case, we concentrate on what a person who is harassed thinks or how a victim feels. In one case, a female bus conductor wasn't comfortable that a bus driver liked to slap her butt and make a dirty joke about her body. He claimed he did that to other bus conductors and nobody complained. Yet what he felt didn't matter. What mattered was how the conductor felt,"" the TKF director explained. ""Sexual harassment is about a person who has power harassing someone who has a lower status. We don't see a male employee harassing a factory owner or a daughter of the owner."" Fighting sexual harassment isn't easy. When someone faces sexual harassment, what should she or he do? Jaded suggested that victims need to collect evidence. And it is difficult to file a lawsuit if a victim is harassed by unwanted staring or unwelcome verbal conduct. ""Many victims who were harassed by leering or inappropriate comments didn't complain. They think if it wasn't a touching case, it would be difficult to make a case because we need clear evidence. Yet anyone who needs legal advice can come to WMP,"" Jaded said. ""There are counselling services available at the Department of Mental Health Hotline, 1323, the Department of Social Development and Welfare, 1300, and organisations helping women,"" Naiyana suggested. And if a victim can express her feelings to harassers, she should do so. ""A confrontation in a public place such as a workplace can make a harasser feel embarrassed and stop harassing. A harasser keeps harassing a woman because he knows that she is afraid of speaking up or thinks it is something normal,"" Jaded said. Naiyana echoed the idea. ""A person who can speak up must have had experience of power gender imbalance for a while. Thirty years ago, I felt that guys had power above me. A victim must know what she can do and what consequences will occur afterward,"" said Naiyana. Improving the unbalanced power structure in a male-dominated society, both Naiyana and Jaded believe, should start at the family level. The idea that sexual harassment isn't something normal should be implanted early. ""Don't think harassment is a normal practice,"" Jaded concluded. ""Don't get used to sexual harassment. When men have harassment ideas, they think about sex. If we don't change this action, it will be more violent or lead to a rape. Our education is also a failure. In textbooks, we have images of women as housewives who behave conservatively. The education system oppresses women and LGBTI, especially in a patriarchal society. We should learn about gender equality, and every gender is entitled to equal respect."""

											'Vile' UK paedophile receives 13 life sentences										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/1195113/vile-uk-paedophile-receives-13-life-sentences,"LONDON - A retired English teacher was jailed for at least 16 years on Wednesday for what the judge called an ""appalling catalogue"" of sex offences against children in Thailand and Britain. Mark Frost, aka Andrew Tracey: Groomed, then raped young Thai and British boys. Mark Frost, 70, also known as Andrew Tracey admitted 45 sex offences against nine children in Thailand between 2009 and 2012, and two British pupils in the 1990s. The offences including rape, sexual assault and inciting sexual activity with a child under 13. His victims were aged between 10 and 15. At England's Central Criminal Court in London, he was sentenced to serve 13 concurrent life sentences and will spend a minimum of 16 years in jail. His crimes were ""the most appalling catalogue of sexual abuse"", judge Mark Lucraft said. ""It is clear you have an obsession with sexually abusing young boys with evidence of planning and grooming. Your conduct towards each and every one of these victims is horrific and deeply disturbing."" He added Frost's offences were ""truly shocking"" and that he was someone who will continue to pose a risk to children. The court heard how Frost groomed Thai boys with cash and sweets - then raped them and encouraged them to engage in sex acts. ""The harrowing evidence presented by the prosecution in this case outlined the suffering that Mark Frost caused to his victims,"" said Ruona Iguyovwe, from the state's Crown Prosecution Service. ""Over many years, Frost repeatedly exploited vulnerable young victims, both in the UK and in Thailand, for his own sexual gratification. ""His offending has caused severe psychological harm to all of the children he abused, many of whom are now old enough to realise the enormity of what happened to them."" The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) urged other potential victims to come forward. ""Mark Frost's vile campaign of sickening child abuse spanned over quarter of a century in the UK and abroad, and today's sentence will likely see him spending the rest of his days behind bars,"" a spokesman said. ""Frost was a prolific and dangerous paedophile who worked as a teacher and Scout leader for decades. We hope that anyone who suffered can now find the courage to speak out."""

											Police search German allotment garden in Madeleine McCann case										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/1958875/police-search-german-allotment-garden-in-madeleine-mccann-case,"BERLIN - Police are searching an allotment plot in the northern German city of Hanover in connection with the disappearance of British girl Madeleine McCann, prosecutors said Tuesday. Madeleine went missing from her family's holiday apartment in the Portuguese holiday resort of Praia da Luz on May 3, 2007, a few days before her fourth birthday, as her parents dined with friends at a nearby tapas bar.  Despite a huge international manhunt, no trace of her has been found, nor has anyone been charged over her disappearance.  ""I can confirm that the search is being carried out in connection with our investigations into the Maddie McCann case,"" Brunswick prosecutor Julia Meyer told AFP, when asked about the operation first reported by local Hannoversche Allgemeine newspaper. Police began searching the site in the early hours of Tuesday morning, clearing trees and using an excavator, the newspaper report said. Meyer gave no details of how the plot was connected to the case or what they were hoping to find. Police revealed in June that they were investigating a 43-year-old German man over the 2007 disappearance of three-year-old ""Maddie"", saying they believe he killed her. The suspect, who was not named by police but identified by German media as Christian B., lived in Hanover from 2007, according to the Hannoversche Allgemeine. - Previous convictions - Christian B. has a history of previous convictions including child sex offences and rape. He is currently serving a sentence for drug trafficking in Kiel. He has applied to be released early on probation after having completed two-thirds of the sentence, with a decision still pending.  A court in Brunswick had separately sentenced Christian B. to seven years in prison last December for an assault against a 72-year-old American tourist in 2005 -- in the same seaside village of Praia da Luz where Maddie went missing. But that sentence has not yet been finalised pending an appeal by the defendant's lawyers over extradition technicalities. - 'Concrete evidence' - According to police, the suspect lived in the Algarve region of Portugal between 1995 and 2007.  He made a living doing odd jobs in the area where Madeleine was taken, and also burgled hotel rooms and holiday flats. German prosecutors said in June they had ""concrete evidence"" that Madeleine is dead, despite British police continuing to treat her disappearance as a missing persons case. However, despite repeated appeals for information, prosecutors have no forensic evidence and have so far not filed any formal charges. In a recent TV appeal, investigators said they were looking for the owner of a Portuguese mobile phone number that Christian B. had called in May 2007. While living in Hanover, Christian B. received fines for forgery in 2010 and for theft in 2013, according to a report by German news agency DPA. He split his time between Germany and Portugal from 2013 to 2015, the report said, citing prosecutors in Hanover. At the end of 2012, he reportedly opened a small shop in Brunswick with his then girlfriend. After they split up, he continued to run the shop alone until he gave it up 18 months later, along with the adjacent apartment. Investigators have said Christian B. would only be questioned in connection with the Madeleine McCann case after the investigation is concluded, so that they could present him with the findings of the probe."

											Reenactment of child rape sparks anger										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/1946232/reenactment-of-child-rape-sparks-anger,"A Myanmar man who raped and choked a five-year-old girl to death in Tak province reenacted the assault yesterday amid tight police protection to prevent attacks from enraged bystanders. Mae Sot police yesterday took Sarim, 28, to the forest behind a Muslim community in Mae Sot district to carry out the reenactment of the crime. The girl's naked dead body was found on Saturday with wounds consistent with her having being tied with rope. Sarim was arrested the same day with the case enraging the community in Mae Sot district, a border town opposite Myanmar with many residents from the country. Many furious locals formed a crowd at the police station on Saturday and extra officers were deployed yesterday to ensure the reenactment could go ahead without disturbance. Police said Sarim had confessed to inviting the girl for a walk with him while he was under the influence of illegal drugs. He said he took the girl into a nearby patch of woods where he carried out the assault. He said he had not intended to kill the victim but his efforts to stifle her screams had resulted in her death. Sarim told police he had panicked and hid the body in bushes nearby before fleeing the scene. According to police, the suspect had served an eight-year sentence in jail for rape and murder before moving to work in Thailand. Pol Maj Gen Parinya Wisitdakul, chief of Tak provincial police, said the arrest had occurred after locals tipped off his officers about the likely culprit. Meanwhile, in Kanchanaburi, provincial police took Korakot Sukdee, 28, who had been arrested for raping a deaf-mute woman, 27, on June 28, to reenact the crime at a rental house in Muang district. According to investigators, the suspect had been released from prison in April after serving a sentence for theft."

6,2020-06-16 04:00:00,Fighting a shadow pandemic,https://www.bangkokpost.com/life/social-and-lifestyle/1935600/fighting-a-shadow-pandemic,"Working from home during the height of Covid-19 was hell on earth for Bella*, a mother of two. Her abusive and alcoholic husband, whom she had been married to for a decade, had begun to physically and sexually violate her more now that she was working from home. The abuse often took place in front of the children, who were trying to keep up with schoolwork through remote learning. The abuse had become so severe that after an unprovoked altercation in the bedroom -- which left Bella with a broken nose -- paramedics were called by  neighbours to resuscitate her after they had been alerted by the couple's nine-year-old son who had found her on the bathroom floor with her nightgown drenched in blood. After recovering from her injuries, Bella opted to return to her abusive husband instead of going to a social welfare shelter because she feared getting infected with Covid-19. Bella's case is just one among many which demonstrates the rise in domestic violence incidents amid the coronavirus outbreak. Sadly, this is taking place not only in Thailand but across the globe. As a result of this unfortunate phenomenon, the 10th Asia Pacific Conference on Reproductive and Sexual Health Rights recently organised a discussion on the topic of ""Sexual and gender-based violence during Covid-19 in Asia and the Pacific regions"". At the event, panellists from Fiji, Tonga, Cambodia and Thailand shared how violence against women and children -- already a prevalent social problem in their individual communities -- had doubled in terms of reported cases amid the pandemic. While stats regarding the surge in violence against women and children are still scarce, news reports support the belief that there has been a significant increase in domestic violence as a result of the pandemic. Moreover, reports also seem to suggest that there has been a reduction in the number of survivors seeking support due to a combination of lockdown measures and/or women not opting to avail of health services due to fear of infection. A specialist for the UN Women Fiji Multi-Country Office for Ending Violence Against Women and Girls Programme, Abigail Erikson, stated that recent statistics show that last year alone, 243 million women and girls between 15 to 49 worldwide were subjected to sexual and physical violence by their intimate partner. The Pacific island countries have some of the highest recorded rates of sexual and gender-based violence, with nearly two out of three (67%) women experiencing sexual or physical violence by their partner. The violence is recurrent and severe and impacts women, girls, children, families and local communities at large. Public health measures adopted to fight the pandemic such as physical distancing and lockdown, she added, have confined people within their homes and added fuel to the fire. ""There has been an increase in calls to the national helpline numbers with 50% of women reporting a correlation between violence and some Covid-19 containment measure,"" Erikson said. ""Meanwhile, service providers have also reported that sexual and gender-based violence survivors who were already receiving support services have been experiencing more severe and more frequent violence. ""If we do not address the central drivers of gender inequality, violence and discrimination, then we are not going to deliver on the sustainable development goals [SDGs]. The money, resources and the political will that need to be put into addressing this issue should be unveiled against the backdrop of the pandemic and galvanise governments and civil society to direct all their efforts and resources into addressing all forms of such practices. If this happens, it would be a positive outcome of the pandemic."" Matcha Phorn-In, an ethnic minority lesbian feminist and founder of Sangsan Anakot Yawachon Development Project in Thailand, which works with marginalised and vulnerable members of society, remarked that due to increased travel restrictions, lockdown and home-­quarantine measures caused by Covid-19, there has been a rise in cases of sexual, physical and mental abuse, and gender-based violence in families she works with. The human rights defender said marginalised communities were already residing in crisis-like situations even prior to the pandemic. She described how a countless number of girls and women face poverty, discrimination and violation based on their ethnicity, stateless status, gender or sexual orientation. Meanwhile, the LGBTI community is also scared to seek public healthcare and/or other government services because homophobia and sexual discrimination hugely impacts their access to services. When Covid-19 struck, marginalised communities were hit the hardest, according to the executive director of the non-profit organisation. They ran out of food and were out of a job before others. Adding further insult to injury for the stateless and undocumented migrant workers and refugees living in Thailand without ID cards was that government aid during the pandemic was not available to them. This heightened their vulnerabilities. Matcha has made calls for safe access to abortion for all women; comprehensive sexual education in schools; legalisation of sex work; and laws to protect the rights of migrant workers, stateless people, sex workers and the LGBTI community. ""We need to change the system which fundamentally oppresses women,"" she said. ""This pandemic cannot be used as an excuse to stall progress made against sexual and gender-based violence. We require more engagement of women at the policy-making level and our government must listen to their voices to ensure an effective response to sexual and gender-based violence. ""In a culture such as ours which normalises domestic violence, the current Covid-19 measures have created an environment where women and children can become victims of abuse at the hands of a spouse or guardian more frequently because of the circumstances they are in."" While Thailand has not kept any statistics on this matter, social agencies have seen a drastic increase, Matcha explained. ""At recent engagements agencies such as the OSCC -- One Stop Crisis Center, or Social Help Center -- reported that the cases of domestic violence had doubled compared to the same time last year, while the Samaritans Thailand, a hotline for suicide prevention, have gone on record to say that they have found a three-fold increase in the number of callers, most of whom expressed concern over financial matters brought on due to Covid-19."" As for Cambodia, Dr Chivorn Var, executive director of the Reproductive Health Association of Cambodia (RHAC), said that confinement is likely to increase risks of partner violence as well as reduce access to regular lifesaving sexual and gender-based violence services. He said schools and most businesses in Cambodia had closed due to Covid-19 although it was not mandatory to stay at home. ""In Cambodia, we have laws, policies and programmes of action related to sexual and gender-based violence. We have to improve their implementation at the ground level through intersectoral coordination at the national and sub-national level. There is also a need to increase resources for continuity of care and lifesaving support and collection of age-specific data on gender issues."" Meanwhile, Ofa-Ki-Levuka Guttenbeil-Likiliki, director of the Women and Children Crisis Centre (WCCC), said that in Tonga, over 80% of sexual violence incidents, including child sexual abuse as well as rape and incest, happen within homes. ""Twenty-five percent of Tongan women have experienced either physical or sexual violence. But the majority of the support and response services -- like legal aid, safe houses or shelter homes, counselling services, sexual and reproductive health services -- for survivors of sexual and gender-based violence are on the main island. Women and children living in the five outer Tongan islands do not have direct access to these services."" Matcha added that addressing domestic and gender-based violence at its root is a must because, for one, the situation has reached a crisis point, with Thailand still lagging behind when it comes to making any tangible progress. She believes one of the reasons why men in general feel entitled to physically and sexually abusing women and children in Thailand is because of the mindset they have developed that the consequences of their actions will not get them into trouble. ""Thailand is a male-dominated society. The fact that we don't have a female representative to actually push our cause, both prior to Covid-19 and even now, makes the situation more dire for victims of abuse, especially with the implementation of work from home and quarantine restrictions that have exacerbated an already bad situation.

											Man charged with rape of niece's 5-year-old daughter										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/1933100/man-charged-with-rape-of-nieces-5-year-old-daughter,"BURI RAM: A 43-year-old man has been arrested for the alleged rape of his niece's 5-year-old  daughter at his house in Khan Dong district. Local police took the man into custody after he surrendered to Khan Dong police on Wednesday, following a complaint by the girl’s mother, 26. She alleged that her uncle, her mother's younger brother, had raped her young daughter, police said. The 43-year-old suspect allegedly admitted having raped the girl. He said he called her in to play at his house around 11am on Monday. He took her to his bedroom, stripped the girl and then raped her. He said she had cried out in pain until he stopped 10 minutes later.  He said he raped the girl because his wife of 10 years had left him. He was lonely and drank heavily.  When he saw the girl on Monday he became aroused and so called her into his house.  Thai media reported the girl ran crying and bleeding from the house to her grandmother, and told her what happened. The woman took her grandchild to hospital for an examination, which confirmed the girl had been sexually abused. The girl's mother then filed a complaint against her uncle. The suspect was taken for a crime re-enactment on Thursday. He has been charged with four counts -  sexually abusing a minor aged below 13, performing an obscene act on a girl aged below 15, taking a girl aged below 15 for an obscene act, and depriving a girl aged below 15 of parental care. The man was due in court later on Thursday, when police would apply to detain him for another 12 days,  and oppose bail. "
8,2020-06-01 04:30:00,Culture of rape,https://www.bangkokpost.com/life/social-and-lifestyle/1927492/culture-of-rape,"A recent rape case in Mukdahan province shocked the entire nation when it was brought to light that two underage female students were raped by five teachers and two school alumni. While the case was devastating on its own, it was all the more enraging when some netizens showed outright support to the perpetrators and shifted blame to the young victims. A teacher is generally a respected profession in the country. Even more so in rural areas where they play a role in the school and community. Thais are taught to be grateful to teachers for providing them with knowledge. The Mukdahan case has shone an unwanted spotlight on an ugly side of this profession, which experts see as an abuse of the power structure and patriarchy in our institutions and society. During a recent online panel discussion on the problem of rape and power, it was reported that about 50% of hundreds of rape and sexual violence attacks are on victims aged 11-20 years old, and that the perpetrators in about 5-10% of cases are teachers. These statistics were based on cases of rape and sexual violence as reported in the news from 2013-2017. But, as panellists pointed out, these numbers are much lower than what's really happening in society. ""This is a structural problem,"" said Varaporn Chamsanit, from the Women Wellbeing programme. ""It's not just about a child being unfortunate and running into bad teachers. These incidents are repeated over and over. However, we never get to know how prevalent it is in reality as some just don't get publicised. Many cases ended with both sides agreeing to a settlement. The perpetrators paid their way out. Some also married the victims."" Jaded Chouwilai, director of the Women and Men Progressive Movement Foundation, said the authoritarian nature within the bureaucratic system is held above the power of students who don't really have a say in what they want. The structure in educational institutions also gives power to teachers, not students. With their status, teachers are likely to know influential people, especially within rural communities, including policemen, leaders and local politicians, leading to many cases ending in a settlement. ""And when anything bad happens, people would automatically view that teachers -- believed to be virtuous by default -- would never do such a thing. Then, some just turn to attacking young victims instead,"" said Jaded. Children are bound to listen to teachers. And as they spend a lot of time together, a chance that teachers may abuse their power is also increased. ""In a way, it's a power bestowed from culture itself, which views that we are indebted to teachers. We don't respect them because of their individual knowledge, performance or behaviour. We just do for the fact that they are teachers, without considering much else. This mindset doesn't just affect children, but also their parents and people within the community,"" said Varaporn. Both Jaded and Varaporn said this rape epidemic is related to the patriarchy. ""Thai culture gives more freedom to men when it comes to sex, and urges and coerces them to be experienced. They cheat, have mistresses and pay people for sex, and society sort of compromises that it's acceptable to do so. But women are controlled and taught not to be promiscuous,"" said Varaporn. Jaded added that rape incidents happen everywhere with shared factors, including the inability to restrain oneself and the tendency to exercise and abuse one's power. Alcohol also plays a role as a catalyst. Whenever a rape case is reported, fingers are often pointed at female victims. The way they dress, the time they choose to commute, and even the place they happen to be at have become reasons for people to conclude that the victims were asking for trouble. With the Mukdahan case, social media erupted when a post made by a fellow teacher cheered for the perpetrators and expressed concerns for their wives and family, while saying the students were ungrateful for making the rape public. ""If you don't want your children to be raped by teachers, then just get them homeschooled,"" stated the Facebook post. Varaporn said that for people to show support for rapists and condemn victims, it shows that they accept violence and, in turn, support rape. ""It's like they're joining the perpetrators in raping and hurting victims again,"" she said. Thicha Na Nakorn, adviser of the Foundation for Children, Youth and Family, said that she has met with the victims of the Mukdahan case. They, too, have been attacked by their own peers for humiliating the school in their decision to expose the teachers' crimes. Thicha wished to see the Minister of Education himself visit the victims and show admiration for their courage in bringing this story to light. This is to discourage the rapists' supporters, while ensuring society that justice will be served. In previous rape cases, Thicha said victim blaming was common, which then harms the victim's self-esteem. She said that it's crucial to empower victims as it also influences their fight to prosecute the perpetrators. ""Empowering can be about changing the goal that the victims aren't fighting only for themselves and their family. A victim in a past rape case has said that she must've been chosen by the higher power. She doesn't want to see this happening to others, which was why she chose to proceed with the case. This is an empowered mindset,"" said Thicha. ""The process of empowerment can change a person from surrendering to being brave. They have a choice whether to stop or to go on,"" she said. If the victims choose to fight, Thicha said that the social mechanism must not isolate them and must accommodate and protect them during the entire process. In her experience, she has seen both civil society organisations and state agencies co-operating to help these victims. ""If state agencies can view civil society organisations as allies, we can recognise our individual strengths and work together to help people,"" said Thicha. The three panellists called for the Ministry of Education to take this issue seriously. Some of their suggestions include for schools to change their evaluation system and allow students, parents and the community be the ones who evaluate their own teaching staff. Thicha said students should be taught and empowered about their own rights at the school. ""If children know and can think for themselves, no teacher would be able to make silly threats like not giving them points or failing them in class [to force them to do things],"" said Thicha. Education Minister Nataphol Teepsuwan responded to the rape case by establishing a centre to protect students who have been sexually violated, with Hotline 1579 available to help victims. Jaded questioned the practicality of this centre and the hotline, suggesting that this mechanism needs to be a neutral space and should involve members from civil society organisations and academics to prevent the perpetrators from being helped by their own people. The panellists also agreed that the centre is only fixing problems at the end. In a campaign on Change.org, over 8,000 people have requested the Ministry of Education to join the victims as complainant against the perpetrators to protect the welfare of students. The petition was supported by a network of 92 organisations that protect women and children in Thailand. The campaign also asks for severe disciplinary actions for those who are found guilty, and asks the ministry to come up with preventive measures and to educate teachers about child's protection and gender equality. The online petition has since been submitted to the Minister of Education."

											Checks on teachers for past abuse										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/1924064/checks-on-teachers-for-past-abuse,"Education Minister Nataphol Teepsuwan on Monday ordered the Office of the Teacher Civil Service and Educational Personnel Commission (OTEPC) to make sure that no teachers or school executives who have been convicted of child sexual abuse offences are able to return to the profession in any capacity. The move follows a school gang rape case in Mukdahan's Muang district early this month. Five teachers at a school in the area were suspended after being charged in connection with the repeated sexual assault of a 14-year-old girl. Two school alumni were also accused of having taken part, and all are said to have taken video clips of the acts. Amporn Pinasa, the OTEPC secretary-general, said yesterday a survey by her office found that about 180 teachers and school executives have been convicted of child sexual abuse over the past three years and all had been suspended or sacked. Ms Amporn said these convicted teachers have already had their teaching licences revoked and would not be able to reapply for work at a school. Nevertheless, she said her office would make details of the offenders available on a nationally accessible database to ensure that there are no loopholes that these offenders can take advantage of to find work where children might be present. The OTEPC chief also said she had been asked to conduct a study into what drove these teachers to commit child sex abuse crimes as well introduce better screening across all areas of teacher procurement and training to make sure that no individuals with a propensity for this type of crime slip through the net in the future. Ms Amporn added that in her experience the best teachers were not always the most knowledgable but often the ones who care the most about the wellbeing of their students and her office would do its best to make sure that trainee teachers who exhibit these characteristics would be fast-tracked into positions in schools across the country. She added that making sure that schools are ""safe spaces for students"" must be a national priority going forward."

											School sex abuse cases spark alarm										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/special-reports/1923208/school-sex-abuse-cases-spark-alarm,"The three child sexual abuses cases which have taken place this month are clearly a wake-up call for all stakeholders to come up with better prevention methods. The latest case, of repeated gang rape in Mukdahan's Muang district earlier this month, was the most disturbing. Thais were shocked to learn the seven suspects were five teachers and two alumni from a public school. They were charged with allegedly raping two student girls aged 14 and 16. According to the police, the suspects first assaulted the victims in March 2019 and carried on at least six times until March this year. Some of the attacks even took place inside the school premises. The suspects denied the charges and were released on bail of 200,000 baht each. Another child abuse case took place in Chumphon's Pathiu district. A 32-year-old music teacher was accused of raping a 12-year-old female student at a resort. The father of the girl lodged a complaint against the teacher who denied the allegation. Another child abuse case occurred in Buri Ram's Ban Dan district when a 39-year-old teacher was arrested on charges of performing obscene acts on a 12-year-old student. He has admitted groping, but denied having sex with her. These alleged child sexual cases have gained significant public attention, raised concerns about the lack of protection for children in schools and prompted calls on the authorities involved to reinforce their efforts to prevent sexual harassment in schools. The Bangkok Post talked to a variety of stakeholders including educators, child experts, policymakers, police and criminologists, asking them how the problem can be dealt with, particularly the school gang rape case in Mukdahan. RESPONSIVE SCHOOLS Chulalongkorn University's education expert Athapol Anunthavorasakul said the cases represent a failure to protect children and should serve as a strong wake-up call to society to protect children better. ""Schools must be safe havens for children and no child should suffer from any form of violence in schools. Teachers must be the ones who protect children in their care, not the ones who harm them,"" he said. Mr Athapol said the supportive comments made by colleagues of the suspects also show how nepotism comes first in the Thai school system, not teachers' professional ethics nor morality. ""These men were sexually exploiting their students and treated the school as a brothel for over a year, yet their superiors and colleagues thought nothing was wrong with it. ""It is impossible that nobody knew about it, but nepotism made other teachers turn the other way. Had it not been for the fierce anger from the public, these men might have been spared by the school's nepotism again,"" he said. Mr Athapol said although most Thai schools have a student affairs division to provide support to students outside the classroom, many lack accessible and child-sensitive complaint mechanisms for students who are sexually abused. ""Most students who are victims of sexual violence don't know who they can turn to. They are afraid their complaints may not be taken seriously and fear reprisals. They need someone or a channel they can trust,'' he said. Mr Athapol said confidential reporting channels should be established in all schools and staff and students alike must know how to use them. Schools should also have clear referral pathways to social welfare agencies and work with multidisciplinary teams to provide support to survivors of violence and abuse. Teachers and other school staff can play an important role in preventing sexual harassment before it takes place by observing children, watching for signs of violence, abuse and neglect and reporting it when they have concerns, he added. ""Teachers should make a list of students in their classes who are vulnerable and at greater risk of sexual abuse such as those come from broken homes or live with step-parents or a single parent. More importantly, they must dare to stand up for victims even if the abusers are school staff members or their co-workers,"" he said. According to the Office of Basic Education Commission's Student Protection Centre, 624 student sexual assault cases were reported to the centre over the past five years. Out of these, 76 cases were committed by teachers or school staff. ''I'm certain that the true number is larger since so much of the problem goes unreported,'' Mr Athapol said. The expert also warned schools not to focus on protecting girls as sexual assaults can happen to anyone. Boys and LGBT children can fall victim to sexual predators as well. ""Boys and LGBT children have many of the same feelings and reactions as other survivors of sexual assault, but they may also face some additional challenges because of social attitudes and stereotypes about men and masculinity,'' he said. Child rights advocate Ticha Na Nakorn has called on the Education Ministry to rehabilitate the education system by reforming the spirit of the profession. She was referring to the case of the school gang rape by five teachers in Mukdahan. ""I do not come out in public to attack this profession because there are still decent teachers about. The challenge is how to help these good teachers and whistleblowers protect children,"" said Ms Ticha. The Justice Ministry is mulling compensating the victims by 110,000 baht each, while child psychologists from the Ministry of Social Development and Human Security have provided counselling. The 16-year-old victim, who is also a witness in the case of the 14-year-old, has been placed in the care of a Justice Ministry facility in Mukdahan province. COMPLAINT CENTRES Education Minister Nataphol Teepsuwan said he has ordered a complaint centre set up at the ministry for students to report any sexual misconduct by their teachers. He also instructed provincial officers to probe the school's director for possible negligence. The five teachers among the accused were immediately suspended and their licences revoked, Mr Nataphol said. ""This is a serious offence and I will not tolerate it. School is a second home to students. If the place is unsafe because of a teacher's behaviour, I have to put an end to it,"" the minister said. ""Under my watch, there will be no more transfers to inactive posts,"" he added. ""Every offender will be immediately fired."" UNICEF STEPS IN Unicef has called on the Ministry of Education to consider a review of protection measures, monitoring mechanisms and response protocols. ""The review, in partnership with professional bodies such as the Teachers' Council of Thailand, can also help in strengthening the code of conduct for teachers and other education staff, further ensure these codes are effectively implemented, and appropriate sanctions applied,"" it said. Teacher training curricula and professional development opportunities should include training about the causes of school-related violence and abuse, prevention activities, referral and response frameworks and ethical conduct."

Under the revised law, adults who have sex with under-16-year-olds will be prosecuted for child sexual abuse or rape regardless of any alleged consent. Previously, teenagers aged 13 or older were held to be legally capable of consenting to sex, resulting in controversial cases and critics saying that sex offenders were escaping without punishment due to the low benchmark. In 2017, a 42-year-old man was found not guilty of raping a then 15-year-old on the grounds she had consented, provoking outrage and calls for the age limit to be raised. Despite its economic and technological advances, South Korea remains a traditional and patriarchal society, where victims of sexual assault have been shamed for coming forward. The age of consent was raised to 16 in order to ""protect teenagers from sex crimes at a fundamental level"", the South's Justice Ministry said in a statement.

The three teachers are Wipoj Saensuk, Anupap Banjong and Yutthana Phuthanonnok, according to Pol Lt Col Preecha Krongyut, the inspector at Phueng Daet police station overseeing the case. Although the teachers have been accused of organising the gang rape and asked others to join in, they will not be charged with human trafficking, said Pol Lt Col Preecha. The 16-year-old victim, a student at the same school, is serving as a witness in the first gang rape case against a 14-year-old girl. The teenager said she had been raped by some of the suspects accused in the other case and the information she had provided corroborated that given by the first victim.

Sirikarn Klongdee, the child psychologist caring for her said the girl was under an extreme amount of stress following her ordeal. She has been given sedatives and psychological counseling, said Ms Sirikarn, adding that while the girl does not come from a poor family, her parents are divorced. Both victims were reportedly raped on a number of occasions over a one-year period starting in March 2019. The alleged gang rape case sparked national outrage when the grandmother of the 14-year-old girl filed a criminal complaint last week. So far, police had pressed charges against five teachers and two male alumni. All have denied the charges against them and requested bail, which was granted. One of suspects, Anupap Banjong has reportedly gone to stay at his father's home in nearby Nakhon Phanom province.

											World standing by as children harmed by conflict: charity										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/1857489/world-standing-by-as-children-harmed-by-conflict-charity,"LONDON - Governments were on Thursday urged to do more to protect children from the effects of war and serious violence, after a new report suggested record numbers were living in a conflict zone. Save the Children said wars were becoming more dangerous for children, with youngsters facing an increased risk of death and injury, being recruited by armed groups or sexual abuse. ""It's staggering that the world stands by while children are targeted with impunity,"" the charity's chief executive Inger Ashing said in a statement to accompany the report. ""Since 2005, at least 95,000 children were recorded to have been killed or maimed, tens of thousands of children abducted, and millions of children denied access to education or health services after their hospitals were attacked."" Ashing warned that ""the destruction of children's lives"" will continue if nothing is done and those responsible for crimes are not brought to account. - Record numbers - The report said nearly one in six children around the world -- some 415 million children -- were living in a conflict zone in 2018, more than double the figure recorded in 1995. Incidents of ""grave violations"" against them had risen by  170 percent since 2010, the ""Stop the War on Children"" study found. African children were the worst affected, with 170 million living in war zones, although a higher proportion were hit in the Middle East, where almost one in three were surrounded by conflict.  The report also found record numbers of children being subjected to grave violations: killing and maiming; recruitment by armed forces; abduction; attacks on schools or hospitals; denial of humanitarian access; and rape and other forms of sexual violence. For individual countries, the situation was worst in Afghanistan followed by Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iraq and Mali. Different threats faced by boys and girls was analysed for the first time.  ""Girls are at far higher risk of sexual and other forms of gender-based violence, including child, early and forced marriage,"" the study found. ""Boys are much more likely to be exposed to killing and maiming, abductions and recruitment,"" it added. - Kidnapping, child soldiers - Victims from both genders recounted their experiences in the report, including Samira, a 15-year-old Yazidi girl from Iraq who is mother to a two-year-old child.  She was kidnapped with her mother and sisters in 2016, kept in captivity and sold to at least three people who beat and sexually assaulted her. She was then forced into marriage with an Islamic State fighter and gave birth, returning home while her child remained under the care of authorities in Syria.  ""I would prefer to stay in slavery and live in camps my whole life rather than leave my child,"" she was quoted as saying. ""I did not want to leave her to live without (her) mother or to live the life that I lived. I wanted to give her the rights that I have been denied as a child."" Another recounted how a young boy called Peter was recruited by an armed group in South Sudan before escaping to Uganda.  ""They gave us weapons for shooting,"" he said.

											Man charged with raping five-year-old girl at US embassy in Delhi										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/1852734/man-charged-with-raping-five-year-old-girl-at-us-embassy-in-delhi,"NEW DELHI - An Indian man has been charged with raping a five-year-old girl on the premises of the US embassy in India's capital New Delhi, police said Thursday. The 25-year-old was arrested at the high-security compound on Sunday a day after the alleged incident at the living quarters for local housekeeping staff. Police officer Yogesh Kumar told AFP preliminary medical tests confirmed the girl had been raped. The man was charged under child rape laws that carry the death penalty. The sprawling diplomatic compound is one of the most secure in Delhi, with multiple layers of manned and electronic security.  A US Embassy spokesperson in New Delhi said Friday that it was ""deeply disturbed"" by the allegations and it took ""prompt action"" including reporting the incident to the police and helping arrange medical assistance. ""We are cooperating with the Indian-led investigation. We extend our sympathy and full support to the child and her family,"" the spokesperson said in a statement. India is struggling to combat a growing number of sexual assault cases in the country. Violence against women in the South Asian nation has been under the international spotlight following the brutal gang-rape and murder of a Delhi student on a bus in 2012. Almost 34,000 rapes were reported in 2018, according to official data, with activists claiming the figure is just the tip of the iceberg. Experts said most child victims are known to their abusers, with their families frequently choosing not to report the crimes to authorities amid social taboos against speaking out."

Men, women and children can all end up behind bars for committing criminal acts. Ignorance of the law is no excuse. Many jurists advocate that laws be reconsidered periodically to determine whether they are still applicable. Some turn into the Blue Laws of yore, still on the books but no longer enforced. Others get overturned. One More LieAmy Lloyd Arrow389ppAvailable at Asia Books and leading bookshops315 baht A case in point is the banning of alcohol in the US in 1920. So many people broke that law that it was finally rescinded 13 years later. Marijuana laws have similarly been criticised. The prevailing attitudes appear to be changing. Time will tell. Even with so many laws being revised, perpetrators of serious crimes like robbery, rape and murder still fill prisons. Devil worship, human trading and sacrifices are so horrific that they are played down by the media, their adherents labelled ""evil"". The citizenry is so irate at the blood lust of those arrested that they want to tear them apart. Yet what if the evil ones are children themselves? Do they deserve leniency? In One More Lie by Welsh writer Amy Lloyd, age is taken into consideration, but it's not just a tap on the wrist. Charlotte, who as a preteen is involved in the horrific murder of another child, gets a new identity, psychiatric counselling and a band around her ankle to monitor her movements. Finally, at the age of 28, she is deemed fit to re-enter society and gets a job in customer relations. She has not had any contact with Sean, her partner in crime, since the incident 17 years before. Heavy on psychology, the plot is about Charlotte trying to adjust to her newfound freedom, such as it is. A spanner is thrown in the works when Sean tries to re-establish contact. She refuses him. For her, it was a one-time thing. But it has branded her. Awake or asleep, she can think of nothing else. The action is set in Wales and Scotland. Lloyd doesn't look at the locals through rose-tinted glasses. They, the ones her protagonist meets at least, are rather short-tempered, rarely polite. One constable is a decent fellow, the other isn't. Her shrink writes to her, but doesn't give her patient her return address. The story has no ending as such. Charlotte does her job and has her memories. She wonders how Sean is doing, yet has no intention of ever meeting him again. Life goes on. Critics have praised One More Lie as superb, thought-provoking, well-worth reading, etc. I question whether you will enjoy perusing it in one sitting. This reviewer has read many books in one sitting, but this isn't one of them. Charlotte is more a sympathetic than a likeable character. Then again, their childhood crime can't be condoned. As Dostoevsky pointed out, laws are about crime and punishment. The criminal justice system specifies how much jail time be accorded for the felonies and misdemeanours committed. Defence lawyers plead mitigating circumstances to lessen the severity of the verdict. Prosecutors are determined to throw the book at the defendant. Elevator PitchLinwood BarclayHQ455ppAvailable at Asia Books and leading bookshops550 baht Which is where motive plays a major part. The defence will try to make it appear as if the defendant had compelling reasons. To the prosecutor, this will be irrelevant; the act speaks for itself. To be sure, motives do greatly vary. Having had abusive parents is a common one. This warps a child's concept of human relationships. Blind jealousy is another common motive, as an infuriated wife or husband learns their spouse has betrayed their marriage vows. Then there's the co-ed who killed and chopped up her classmate for coming on to her best friend's boyfriend. Or what of the gunman massacring a crowd, claiming he's a political activist? Vengeance is in a class of its own, because it applies to countries as well as individuals. Countries that have lost a war and, with it, possessions and/or territory, often look for an excuse to wage a new war to redress the balance. Individuals may harbour thoughts of vengeance for wrongs, real or imagined, done to them or their loved ones. Crime thriller novelists are particularly fond of this variety. US author Linwood Barclay has a go in Elevator Pitch. Set in Manhattan, it focuses on its ubiquitous skyscrapers, filled with offices and thousands upon thousands of people coming and going every day. In the The classic film The Towering Inferno a packed skyscraper catches fire. Not all survived. We don't even need fiction to imagine such scenarios; the 9/11 suicide attacks on the Twin Towers left around 3,000 dead. In Elevator Pitch the scrivener zeros in on the lifts; regardless of the floor button pressed, it shoots to the top, then plummets to the bottom, fatal to all aboard. A tragic, inexplicable accident. Or is it? When it happens again the next day, the media starts asking questions. The third such crash a day later shuts down the offices. A body is found with its hands cut off, delaying identification. Elevator inspectors and the NYPD find other means to reach the top. Sure enough, the gear had been sabotaged. Why? There's an intense investigation, a journalist at the forefront. It all adds up to not very much."
22,2014-09-09 06:00:00,It starts at home,https://www.bangkokpost.com/life/social-and-lifestyle/431249/it-starts-at-home,"Fai's blank stare and impassive voice mask years of sexual and verbal abuse at the hands of men who were supposed to protect and guide her.  When family members saw her being touched inappropriately by an older male relative, they turned a blind eye, solely because the individual was the family breadwinner. During her schooling years, things didn't change much. She was victimised by teachers and professors, senior figures she had little power to bring to justice. The subservient Fai could hardly come to terms with her misfortune when she began working, as her bosses continued the vicious cycle of sexual abuse. Years of abuse made her numb, both to the physical and emotional pain, pushing her into depression. It was only when Fai became suicidal that she sought help. While the 30-something is still coming to terms with her past, she has found solace in volunteering her time to help counsel other rape victims. ""Fai's case is not an isolated one,"" said Varaporn Chamsanit, programme manager for the Women's Wellbeing and Gender Justice Programme, a women's movement network. Women's social welfare groups in Thailand confirm that the rate of physical and sexual violence against females of all ages has reached a pandemic level. ""We live in a male-dominated society in which sexual inequality causes men to believe that they have the right to suppress the fairer sex. There is, however, much more to it than meets the eye,"" Varaporn said. ""While laws will take time to amend, and society's attitudes even longer to iron out, we can collectively work to address all forms of violence against women by getting involved. We cannot sit idly any longer and say that it is not our problem.  ""It is not justifiable to say that you do not want to get involved because it is a marital or family dispute. It is because of such excuses that perpetrators get away with physical and sexual violence against women. ""If everyone is more emphatic toward women and girls in distress, I believe we can constructively work towards addressing this issue of national concern more productively."" Varaporn has for years worked to promote and protect the rights of Thai women and children. She said that rapists are often acquainted with their victims.  A 2013 UN study of 10,000 men in Asia and the Pacific found that 71% said they felt sexually entitled to violate women. Nearly half, 44%, said the motivation for rape stemmed from boredom, or was enacted as a form of entertainment or fun. Thirty-five percent said rape was used as a form of revenge. Seventeen percent mentioned alcohol and drugs as the motivator. ""The sexual culture in Thailand is one in which men are rarely taught to control and channel their sexual urges in the right manner. Women, on the other hand, are taught to refrain from sex until they are married and be subservient. This is why when a woman is raped, she feels an enormous sense of shame and defilement.   ""It is highly accepted for boys to explore their sexuality through the use of porn magazines, and the common practice of them losing their virginity to a prostitute is encouraged. People with money have an even wider selection of sexual outlets. ""This lenient attitude often gives our male-dominated society the impression that they are allowed to do whatever they please to satisfy their sexual drive."" The glorification of rape in Thai soap operas also sends the wrong signals to viewers, she said. Watching the hero force himself on a woman before they eventually fall in love should not be considered acceptable.  ""It is likely that viewers can become desensitised watching such content and go on to commit what is termed 'romantic rape'. Even though we do not have any statistics to prove this, we cannot rule out the influence television serials have on viewers."" When children and elderly women are raped, studies show the perpetrators are often male relatives or neighbours. While a child often does not report being raped due to fear of retribution, older women often shy away due to shame.    Varaporn said rapists can subdue their victims in non-physical ways. Some may feel entitled to do so because of their higher status in society, a senior position at work or financial dominance.   The ability to get away with rape empowers perpetrators to repeat the crime, she said. This is why society needs to seriously and objectively address the issue.   ""Despite the fact that it is the woman that is the victim, she is often blamed by both the police and media for leading the man on and bringing it on herself,"" said Varaporn.  ""This is one of a handful of reasons why rape has a stigma attached to it. It is imperative for everyone concerned with handling rape cases to understand the victim, who often feels shame and looks at herself as 'damaged property'. ""There is also a certain amount of privacy she is entitled to at this time, which is often overlooked, especially by the media. Sharing the intimate details of the rape to the police officer on duty is the most dreadful moment for victims. Some can insensitively tell the victim that it is useless to file a rape charge when she can't present evidence. This can add to the women's feelings of despondency and lack of self-worth.''   Varaporn said it is important to make the present generation more accountable for their behaviour, and to teach the younger generation to practice safe sex. ""The fabric of society has to be put under scrutiny,"" she said. ""Centuries-old practices have to addressed, and with introspection we can all work toward a solution. Public forums are equally important to explore ways by which to share knowledge on how to understand and constructively address the issue of rape at its roots. ""Schools and parents must also become more accountable in educating young men to respect women. A husband does not have the right to force sex on his wife, while the wife has the right to refuse sex. Mutual respect has to be instilled in our culture.""     Rape is not only a women's issue — men also need to get involved to jump-start change in society's mindset by becoming positive role models. Additionally, parents need to change their views on how to raise their sons to respect women."

Poor farmers burn their fields since they can't afford any other method of weeding. Hill tribe people burn the common forest because it generates mushrooms after the first rains, which apparently earn them 2,000 baht a day at markets. The police are too poorly staffed to catch a few offenders and make examples of them, and the average northern villager is too poorly educated to understand the hazards of an environment made smoky from routine burning of organic rubbish. As for the poor officials, they just blame it all on the poor old people in Myanmar. The ''solution'' is to be rich enough to afford air-conditioning and air purifiers, since no one else seems willing or able to tackle the underlying causes. Matt Balmain With regard to the fine column from Voranai Vanijaka in last Sunday's Bangkok Post, ''Values face off'', I am not only amazed but also dumbfounded that in Thailand a young man with sexual urges is subtly advised through the O-Net exam to go and play football with his friends. It seems there is certainly a lack of understanding of the psychology and physiology of the young test takers. And, of course, a complete denial of the facts on the ground in a land where sex sells on every street corner and newsstand. Just look around, almost every Thai magazine on the stand is like soft porn. They shamelessly target teenagers and contain a healthy dose of risque gossip, nudity, vulgarity and profanity.You can find these magazines in every corner of high schools and universities. What values are we talking about? The O-Net test preparation team must be nuts, and I am pretty sure they must be disappointed with all the wrong answers. It is quite clear from their tweets that the students are having the last laugh. Dr Kuldeep NagiAssumption University, Bangkok I arrived at Suvarnabhumi airport after a twelve-hour flight from England. The immigration process was absolute chaos, with very long queues. I waited two hours in line before it was my turn. I have a problem with one leg, which means I should not stand for lengthy periods. After this experience at the airport I spent the next four days in my hotel, unable to walk any distance. I will certainly not return again to Thailand. Anthony Sneddon  I have noted in the past month the moaning and groaning of a few individuals over the immigration queues at Suvarnabhumi airport. All of my 15 or so arrivals and departures at Suvarnabhumi in the past two year have been swift, and I've usually not had to endure more than three minutes of processing. I would imagine that my experiences are representative of the majority of people. However, visitors and frequent travellers alike should always have tolerance and understanding when venturing to other countries and cultures. Everyone should realise that long queues can be a fact at any big international airport, and even at small ports of entry. I can state this with confidence as I am a former immigration officer myself at an overseas international airport terminal. Next time you take to the road or air, please remember the virtues of tolerance and understanding, or stay jai yen yen as we say in the Land of Smiles.

											Police search German allotment garden in Madeleine McCann case										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/1958875/police-search-german-allotment-garden-in-madeleine-mccann-case,"BERLIN - Police are searching an allotment plot in the northern German city of Hanover in connection with the disappearance of British girl Madeleine McCann, prosecutors said Tuesday. Madeleine went missing from her family's holiday apartment in the Portuguese holiday resort of Praia da Luz on May 3, 2007, a few days before her fourth birthday, as her parents dined with friends at a nearby tapas bar.  Despite a huge international manhunt, no trace of her has been found, nor has anyone been charged over her disappearance.  ""I can confirm that the search is being carried out in connection with our investigations into the Maddie McCann case,"" Brunswick prosecutor Julia Meyer told AFP, when asked about the operation first reported by local Hannoversche Allgemeine newspaper. Police began searching the site in the early hours of Tuesday morning, clearing trees and using an excavator, the newspaper report said. Meyer gave no details of how the plot was connected to the case or what they were hoping to find. Police revealed in June that they were investigating a 43-year-old German man over the 2007 disappearance of three-year-old ""Maddie"", saying they believe he killed her. The suspect, who was not named by police but identified by German media as Christian B., lived in Hanover from 2007, according to the Hannoversche Allgemeine. - Previous convictions - Christian B. has a history of previous convictions including child sex offences and rape. He is currently serving a sentence for drug trafficking in Kiel. He has applied to be released early on probation after having completed two-thirds of the sentence, with a decision still pending.  A court in Brunswick had separately sentenced Christian B. to seven years in prison last December for an assault against a 72-year-old American tourist in 2005 -- in the same seaside village of Praia da Luz where Maddie went missing. But that sentence has not yet been finalised pending an appeal by the defendant's lawyers over extradition technicalities. - 'Concrete evidence' - According to police, the suspect lived in the Algarve region of Portugal between 1995 and 2007.  He made a living doing odd jobs in the area where Madeleine was taken, and also burgled hotel rooms and holiday flats. German prosecutors said in June they had ""concrete evidence"" that Madeleine is dead, despite British police continuing to treat her disappearance as a missing persons case. However, despite repeated appeals for information, prosecutors have no forensic evidence and have so far not filed any formal charges. In a recent TV appeal, investigators said they were looking for the owner of a Portuguese mobile phone number that Christian B. had called in May 2007. While living in Hanover, Christian B. received fines for forgery in 2010 and for theft in 2013, according to a report by German news agency DPA. He split his time between Germany and Portugal from 2013 to 2015, the report said, citing prosecutors in Hanover. At the end of 2012, he reportedly opened a small shop in Brunswick with his then girlfriend. After they split up, he continued to run the shop alone until he gave it up 18 months later, along with the adjacent apartment. Investigators have said Christian B. would only be questioned in connection with the Madeleine McCann case after the investigation is concluded, so that they could present him with the findings of the probe."

											Belgium reopens case with possible link to McCann suspect										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/1933240/belgium-reopens-case-with-possible-link-to-mccann-suspect,"BRUSSELS - Belgium reopened an investigation on Thursday into the 1996 murder of a German teenager because of a possible link with the man suspected of murdering British girl Madeleine McCann. Carola Titze, 16, was found dead and mutilated in July 1996 in the resort town of De Haan on the Belgian coast.  The public prosecutor's office in Bruges ""is indeed reopening the file relating to this murder"", a spokesman told AFP, without giving further details. At the time, Titze was on holiday with her parents and the investigation turned to a German suspect in his early 20s. The man had bragged to her about his criminal past, according to the Belgian media, but he was never found. Following the identification of the German suspect in the ""Maddie"" case, Paul Gevaert, the now retired investigator in charge of the Titze murder probe, said there was ""certainly a connection to be made"".  The suspect, named as 43-year-old ""Christian B."" by German media, has a history of sex offences, including child abuse and rape. ""The description fits,"" Gevaert told Belgian newspaper De Standaard. His investigation was closed unsolved in 2016.  McCann went missing from her family's holiday apartment in Portugal on May 3, 2007, a few days before her fourth birthday, as her parents dined with friends at a nearby tapas bar.  Her disappearance sparked one of the biggest searches of its kind in recent history and became a cause celebre in the British and world media. Last week, German police raised hopes that the case could finally be solved when they revealed they were investigating the new suspect. - Missing girls - According to German police, Christian B. lived in the Algarve in southern Portugal -- where McCann disappeared -- between 1995 and 2007. Currently held in solitary confinement at Kiel prison in the north of Germany, he is serving a jail term for drug trafficking. He has refused to speak about the McCann case, one of his lawyers told German television on Thursday. The possible link between the case of the missing British girl and the Titze investigation in Belgium is not the only one to be raised by investigators since the emergence of Christian B. as a suspect.  In Germany, a five-year-old girl named Inga from the town of Schoenebeck in Saxony-Anhalt in 2015 disappeared without a trace in the woods while on an outing with her family. And in Portugal, the stepfather of an eight-year-old girl who disappeared in 2004 has asked authorities to explore possible links.  Joana Cipriano disappeared in September 2004 in the village of Figueira, not far from Praia da Luz in the southern Algarve.  She has also never been found. In the Netherlands, investigators are taking a closer look at the unexplained disappearance in 1995 of Jair Soares, a seven-year-old Portuguese child.  The case was reopened in 2019, but now the Dutch police say they are ""closely monitoring"" investigations in Germany concerning Christian B., a spokesman told AFP in The Hague. Soares was last seen on August 4, 1995 on a beach just south of the Dutch capital.  mad-lf-jah-arp/jv "

Madeleine, aged three, vanished from the family's holiday apartment in southern Portugal in 2007, sparking a huge investigation, global interest -- and a slew of theories about what might have happened to her. Detectives in Britain and Germany announced on Wednesday night that a 43-year-old German man with a history of child sex abuse was now a prime suspect. ""Biggest break yet in search for Madeleine,"" said the Daily Telegraph, one of six national British newspapers to have the story on their front pages. The Daily Mail asked: ""Have they found man who took Maddie?"" Clarence Mitchell, a spokesman for Madeleine's parents Kate and Gerry, said the couple -- both doctors -- were ""grateful and welcome"" the new appeal for information. ""They have not given up hope of finding Madeleine alive, despite the length of time -- they've never given up that hope.  ""But they are realistic and they say that whatever the outcome of this appeal and the police work, they do need to know because they need to find peace."" - Unidentified suspect - Portuguese police closed their case in 2008 but London's Metropolitan Police, opened a separate missing persons inquiry in 2013, Operation Grange. On Wednesday, detectives told reporters the new suspect was identified in May 2017, after an appeal for information on the 10th anniversary of the little girl's disappearance. He was among more than 600 people previously identified as ""potentially significant"" but was not a suspect in the case then, the force said. Later that year the Met alerted their German counterparts, and police in Portugal were also contacted. The authorities in the southern Portuguese region of Faro confirmed on Wednesday evening they were working with UK and Germany police, including speaking to witnesses. Germany's federal criminal agency said the suspect is serving a ""long prison sentence"" for an unrelated matter and has previous convictions for child sexual abuse. Described as white with short blond hair in 2007, the man was about six feet (1.82 metres) tall, with a slim build. He regularly lived between 1995 and 2007 in the Algarve -- the same region as the Praia da Luz resort town the girl disappeared from -- and did occasional jobs in the area. ""There is information suggesting that he also earned his living by committing criminal offences, such as burglaries of hotel complexes and holiday flats, as well as trafficking in narcotic drugs,"" German police said. - 'Somebody knows something' - Police have released details and images of two vehicles the suspect was known to have used as well as two phone numbers linked to him. Officials believe he was living in one of the vehicles, a ""distinctive and slightly unusual"" VW camper van, at the time of Madeleine's disappearance. They say the registration of his other vehicle, a dark coloured Jaguar XJR 6 which bore a German plate from the city of Augsburg, was changed remotely the day after she vanished. Meanwhile, police add a mobile phone number belonging to the suspect held a 30-minute call in Praia da Luz around an hour before Madeleine was last seen. ""Somebody knows something,"" said Mark Cranwell, the UK's lead investigator, as he appealed for information. ""Some people will know the man we are describing today... I'm appealing to you directly."" The family's spokesman Mitchell echoed British police in calling the suspect's identification ""significant"". ""There has never been something as clear-cut as that from not just one, but indeed now three, police forces,"" he said. Unlike the British missing persons inquiry, Germany's lead investigator Christian Hoppe told ZDF television their probe had led police to suspect that the man had killed Madeleine.  Mitchell said the family wanted closure. ""They simply want to establish what happened to their daughter, to find out the truth and to bring whoever was responsible for her disappearance to justice,"" he said."

											Protecting Asean's most vulnerable										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/1785419/protecting-aseans-most-vulnerable,"The risks are high for migrants who leave home in search of a better future for their families, but nothing can stem the tide of the exodus. The International Organisation for Migration (IOM) reports that the number of migrant workers in Thailand rose to 4.9 million in 2018, which includes around 3.9 million from Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam. Among these are an estimated 300,000-400,000 migrant children. This year marks the 30th anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). All Asean members have ratified the international treaty, which upholds children's rights to survival, protection, development, and social participation. Leaders at this weekend's 35th Asean Summit will adopt the Asean Declaration on the Rights of Children in the Context of Migration, according to the Ministry of Social Development and Human Security. As Bangkok gears up for the historic forum, experts are urging Thailand, as current chair of Asean, to curb child migration amid concerns over human trafficking. Premjai Vungsiriphisal, a senior researcher at Chulalongkorn University's Asian Research Centre for Migration, attributes the influx of migrant children from Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos to socio-economic deprivation. ""For example, the Rong Kluea border market in Sa Kaeo's Aranyaprathet district sees a large number of children doing jobs to support their families. From the Western perspective, child labour is unacceptable. However, the children must work to escape poverty. If authorities launch a new crackdown, what are these children going to do? There should be alternatives to law enforcement, such as raising awareness and providing development opportunities for kids,"" she told the Bangkok Post. Ms Premjai said migrant children in Thailand and other countries find doors through which they can escape poverty. ""Myanmar and Cambodia are developing rapidly, which creates a lot of [job] opportunities in urban areas. However, workers have to pay higher living expenses and compete with other job-seekers in cities. It is very difficult for children to find their feet. ""In Thailand, they earn higher incomes and have more opportunities, such as free education. Do you know that a lot of migrant children cross the border to go to our schools each day? If they have relatives here, they can stay with them overnight,"" she said. However, Ms Premjai warned that migrant children are at risk of being exploited. ""They can be forced into prostitution. Traffickers often lure these innocent girls into believing they will work in restaurants. In these cases, we can take legal action because they become victims of human trafficking. ""However, the problem is that some are willing to become sex workers. I interviewed 15-year-old migrant girls rescued from karaoke brothels a few years ago. When I questioned them, they said they knew what they had to do before starting the job. What should we do if it is their choice [to enter the sex trade]?"" she asked. Ms Premjai wants Thailand and other Asean countries to improve border controls in an effort to end human trafficking. ""Border checkpoints can screen and repatriate migrant children. However, there are other secret channels [for human trafficking]. If Asean joined hands to develop child welfare among its members, it would help reduce the number of illegal migrants in the region,"" she added. Meanwhile, Wanchai Roujanavong, chair of the Asean Commission on Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Women and Children, said verification of migrants remains a challenge. ""It is very difficult to screen them because they don't have identity cards. They can lie about their ages to get jobs. In some cases, they bribe local authorities to forge birth certificates for passport application,"" he said, citing the arrests of underaged migrant workers at massage parlours. Mr Wanchai also proposed that Asean members uphold a single standard for detention of illegal migrants and their children. ""Thailand has already changed its practice. Migrant children are now kept in separate shelters while awaiting repatriation,"" he said. Thientong Prasanpanich, director of Children and Youth System Development at the Ministry of Social Development and Human Security, said Thailand is beefing up cross-border collaboration with neighbouring countries. ""Although Asean members adopted the CRC, they implement policies and laws on child migration differently. Hence, it is difficult for home and host countries to work together. However, we are making progress this year. For instance, Myanmar is showing strong commitment to boosting coordination with us,"" she said. Ms Thientong admitted that Thailand is facing difficulty ensuring that all migrant children can access public services, especially education and health care. ""Thailand's education-for-all policy welcomes migrant children. However, illegal migrant parents fear that if they enrol their children in school, they will be prosecuted for sneaking into the country. Therefore, many kids remain out of school,"" she said. Last year, Thailand's IOM Mission estimated that more than 164,000 migrant children are enrolled in school, while around 200,000 get no formal education. ""Thais are entitled to the 30-baht health scheme because they pay tax. Migrant workers are required to purchase their own healthcare package, which covers their children,"" she said. When asked about other categories of children on the move, Ms Thientong said Thailand still has a reservation to Article 22 of the CRC relating to rights of child refugees and asylum seekers. ""We cannot remove the reservation because we don't have a law on the status of refugees."" However, Thailand's treatment of migrant children has improved since it adopted the CRC in 1992, she added.""The immigration law regards them as innocent even though their parents migrate to Thailand illegally.... The child protection act ensures protection for Thai and non-Thai children while the civil registration act offers registration of birth to anyone born in Thailand."" Ms Thientong reaffirmed the government's commitment to promoting all children's rights to public services. ""Migrant workers are a driving force of the bloc's economy. It is impossible to ignore their children's living conditions. Most importantly, we see them as citizens of Asean,"" she said."

											Victoria Secret ruling under fire										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/1767069/victoria-secret-ruling-under-fire,"Anti-human trafficking groups yesterday petitioned Justice Minister Somsak Thepsutin to look into the Department of Special Investigation's (DSI) decision to drop human trafficking charges against two key suspects arrested in connection with the raid on Victoria Secret massage parlour last year. The Anti-Human Trafficking Network (ATN) called the DSI move ""unusual"" because it was the department which first recommended slapping human trafficking charges against Kampol Wirathepsuporn and Nipa Thiratrakulwattana, who allegedly owned the business and are now on the run. Thanakrit Jit-areerat, the justice minister's secretary, yesterday accepted the petition on Mr Somsak's behalf. Previously, the ATN -- a network consisting of 13 women's rights and child protection organisations -- lodged a petition with Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha asking him to look into the prosecution's dropping of human trafficking charges. Ronnasit Proeksayajiva, president of the Ronnasit Foundation and a member of the network, said the DSI's decision not to pursue human trafficking charges against the pair was strange and had aroused suspicion, so the Justice Ministry must intervene. ""The DSI agreed with the prosecution [to drop the charges] even though it recommended the charges in the first place. So, we're questioning the DSI's judgement and calling on the ministry to investigate,"" he said. Following the raid on Victoria Secret massage parlour on Jan 12 last year, it was revealed that minors and migrant workers were forced to work as sex workers on the premises. More than 80 women found there were believed to have been forced into prostitution by a human trafficking ring. In August last year, the Criminal Court handed down jail sentences to six people involved in the prostitution of underage girls in the case, but dismissed human trafficking charges."

The crackdown took place following tip-offs by members of the public in August that a gang had lured boys and girls to sell sex so that its members could buy drugs, said Pol Maj Gen Worawat Watnakornbancha, chief of the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Division. Police said Narin Rob-rue was the leader of the gang. The other six suspects were Wayu Pasi, Sittichai Ektasang, Wissanu Montha, Tong (family name unknown), Thanongsak Suriyothai and Wasant Sae Tia. The suspects operated from a hotel near Hua Lamphong train station. “There were several groups of customers who were charged 300-500 baht per visit,” Pol Maj Gen Worawat said on Saturday. If the children refused to cooperate, they would be beaten or tortured with fire and blades. Fourteen boys and girls aged 10-16 fell victims to the gang, and the girlfriends of the suspects also sold sex, Pol Maj Gen Worawat said. Police first arrested Prinya Ruenpitak, who they said acted as a procurer, before seeking warrants for 13 others. The operation involved a lockdown of the venue and searches of six other locations during which mobile phones and bank passbooks were seized. “The suspects admitted to committing the crime for at least four months. Several of them also had drug and robbery records. They are being questioned before we hand them over to narcotics police,” Pol Maj Gen Worawat said . Officials from the Social Development and Human Security will take care of the children. Anyone who has information about child abuse can contact police on the 1300 hotline."

											PM urged to probe Victoria's Secret case										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/1760359/pm-urged-to-probe-victorias-secret-case,"Anti-human trafficking advocates are calling on Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha to look into a controversial decision to drop human trafficking charges against key suspects in last year's Victoria's Secret brothel crackdown. The Anti-Human Trafficking Network (ATN), a network consisting of 13 women’s rights and child protection organisations, yesterday submitted a petition to the PM urging him to order an investigation into the legality of the decision made by the director of the Department of Trafficking in Persons Litigation (DTPL). The prosecution has reversed its decision to have the suspects indicted on human trafficking charges since the lower court previously found the suspects guilty of procuring prostitutes illegally, said Chalirat Thimbut, a coordinator of the ATN, at a press conference called ahead of the petition’s submission. “However, the fact remains that on Jan 12, 2018, girls aged 18 and below were among the 113 Myanmar, Lao, Chinese and Thai nationals rescued from a massage parlour in the Rama IX area of Bangkok during a crackdown,” Ms Chalirat said. The investigation into the suspected human trafficking network was broken down into two cases, one for the suspects who worked at the massage parlour and the other for individuals who were believed to actually be the owners of the illegal business, including Kampol Wirathepsuporn and Nipa Thiratrakulwattana, who fled the country after the crackdown, she said. Former national police chief Somyot Poompanmoung last year admitted that he had borrowed “around 300 million baht” from Kampol, whom he described as a friend. Despite the prosecution dropping human trafficking charges, it has still upheld charges relating to money-laundering, Ms Chalirat added. The director of the Department of Special Investigation (DSI) had recommended the director of the DTPL to also indict the suspects on human trafficking charges. Subsequently, the DTPL director ordered a panel to be set up to consider the charges recommended by the DSI. After an investigation, the panel agreed with the DTPL’s recommendation to charge the suspects of human trafficking. However, after the suspects petitioned against the charges, the DTPL director later reversed the panel’s decision and dropped the human trafficking charges. That has raised questions over whether the decision was made solely by the DTPL director. The DTPL has insight about human trafficking at Victoria’s Secret because after a previous crackdown on the business, the agency had provided legal assistance to the rescued women and girls. Ronnasit Proeksayajiva, president of the Ronnasit Foundation and a member of the network, said that prior to the crackdown, the foundation had received a complaint from the parents of a girl forced into prostitution at the brothel, which prompted the foundation to send someone to confirm whether child prostitution was actually taking place. “The brothel offered services such as sex with virgin girls for which it charged customers as much as 100,000 baht as it was a ‘high demand service’,” Mr Ronnasit said. A check into the money trail led to a connection between the illegal business and the people believed to be the real owners, who have now managed to escape human trafficking charges, he said. If the government fails to take proper action against key suspects in this human trafficking case, Thailand will have to pay the price in the next US Trafficking in Persons Report (TIP), said Surapong Kongchantuek, a former member of the human rights committee of the Lawyers Council of Thailand."

											Epstein accuser sues, prison guards 'asleep' when he died										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/1730239/epstein-accuser-sues-prison-guards-asleep-when-he-died,"NEW YORK - An alleged victim of pedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein sued for damages Wednesday as reports claimed his guards were asleep before the disgraced tycoon died from an apparent suicide in prison. Two employees of the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York failed to check on Epstein for three hours and then falsified prison logs to cover up their error, the New York Times reported. The staff members were meant to be inspecting Epstein's cell every 30 minutes but dozed off, several unnamed law enforcement and prison officials familiar with the matter told the newspaper. The revelations came a day after the warden of the high-security facility was temporarily reassigned and two guards put on administrative leave by the Bureau of Prisons, pending an investigation. Epstein, 66, was found dead in his cell on Saturday morning. The FBI and Justice Department are probing how he managed to apparently take his own life just weeks after an earlier reported suicide attempt. US newspapers reported that he had apparently been taken off suicide watch and left without a cellmate, against protocol, while the guards were working overtime due to major staff shortages at the jail. The multi-millionaire, who hobnobbed with numerous politicians and celebrities over the years, was awaiting trial charged with one count of sex trafficking of minors and one count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors. His death came a day after a court released documents in which one of his alleged victims said Epstein used her as a ""sex slave"" and that she was forced to have sex with well-known politicians and businessmen. Another woman, who says she was raped by Epstein as a teenager, sued his estate and former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell under a New York law that came into effect on Wednesday. - Lawsuit - Jennifer Araoz wrote a column in the New York Times saying she was filing a lawsuit under the Child Victims Act against Epstein, British-born socialite Maxwell and other accomplices. Maxwell's recent whereabouts had been unknown but Britain's Daily Mail newspaper reported Wednesday that she had been living in a mansion in Manchester-by-the-sea in Massachusetts. Araoz, now 32, filed the lawsuit in a state court in Manhattan, according to US media. The New York Post said the accomplices were three unidentified women. ""I'm angry he won't have to personally answer to me in the court of law. But my quest for justice is just getting started,"" she wrote in the New York Times. The new law extends the statute of limitations for victims of childhood sex abuse and is expected to trigger a wave of cases against Epstein and accused abusers in separate cases. Even though Epstein's death ended his criminal prosecution, US Attorney General Bill Barr has said prosecutors would pursue cases against anyone else involved in his alleged crimes. FBI agents raided Epstein's private Caribbean island on Little St. James in the US Virgin Islands on Monday. According to prosecutors he sexually exploited dozens of underage teens, some as young as 14, at his homes in Manhattan and Palm Beach, Florida, between 2002 and 2005. He denied the charges but faced up to 45 years in jail if found guilty. Epstein was convicted in Florida in 2008 of paying young girls for massages but served just 13 months in jail under a secret plea deal struck with the then state prosecutor."

Kosol Kliewklai, 55, was arrested in Soi Rattana-uthit in Hat Yai on Saturday, said Pol Col Kuekkong Ditsawat, superintendent of the Anti-Human Trafficking Division subdivision 6. He had been wanted on a warrant issued by the Songkhla provincial court on charges of raping a girl aged below 13 years.  Mr Kosol was jobless and had no place to stay. He sought help from an old school friend, who allowed him to stay at his house, where he was living with his daughter after separating from his wife, said Pol Col Kuekkong. As the girl’s father had to go to work, he asked Mr Kosol to take the girl to school and pick her up. Later, the father noticed his daughter looked quiet and did not want to go out. Because she appeared depressed, he took her to see a psychiatrist at Hat Yai Hospital. Eventually the girl told him the truth, which shocked him.

Cyntoia Brown was 16 when she was convicted of murder and has been in prison in Tennessee since 2004. She is not eligible for parole until 2059 and Democrats in Tennessee have asked the state's Republican Gov Bill Haslam to offer her clemency before he leaves office in January. ""I encourage and plead with my Tennessee Governor @BillHaslam to grant #Clemency4Cyntoia,"" Judd -- a strong advocate in the #MeToo movement -- tweeted this week. ""Cyntoia Brown was a victim of child sex trafficking, raped and forced into paid sexual exploitation to stay alive. She deserves our empathy and your mercy."" Fellow actors Schumer and Elizabeth Banks echoed the call in almost identically worded tweets. State Rep John Ray Clemmons, who was part of a Friday press conference, also took to Twitter to call for clemency. ""The specific facts & circumstances surrounding & presenting Ms. Brown's current status warrant clemency in this instance, eReform."" In the United States, state governors and the US president have the right to pardon prisoners or modify their sentences. Involving anyone under age 18 in commercial sex is considered sex trafficking under US federal law. But it is common for such minors to be charged with crimes such as prostitution, experts say. In the United States, as many as 1,000 children are arrested each year on charges of prostitution, according to Rights4Girls. Some 1.5 million people in the United States are victims of trafficking, mostly for sexual exploitation, according to anti-trafficking groups. Most sex-trafficking victims are children, they say. The campaign to free Brown, promoted as well by singer Rihanna, rapper Snoop Dogg and reality television star Kim Kardashian, comes amid a wave of new laws vacating convictions and expunging criminal records of child-trafficking victims. The measures are often referred to as safe-harbour laws. Twenty states have passed laws making young trafficking victims immune from crimes such as truancy and underage drinking, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Globally, more than 40 million people are victims of human trafficking, according to the International Labour Organization. An estimated 4 million of them are sexually exploited."

											The daring China rescues bringing Vietnam's trafficked girls home										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/1593218/the-daring-china-rescues-bringing-vietnams-trafficked-girls-home,"HANOI - Two girls sprint from a hair salon into a car that will lead them back to safety in Vietnam -- a snapshot of the daring rescues taking place each month to free women and girls from forced marriages or sex slavery in China. Vu, whose name has been changed, knew trying to escape could mean being beaten or even killed by her pimp	 Filmed on a shaky camera phone, the successful rescue saved the Vietnamese teenagers from a brothel in China, where a huge surplus of males has fuelled the lucrative trade for brides and sex workers.  Bringing them home is dangerous work, pitting rescuers against vengeful husbands, pimps and organised trafficking networks who spin tens of millions of dollars selling women from poor Mekong countries.  ""No one wants their business to be broken,"" says a rescuer from Blue Dragon, a Hanoi-based non-profit. Blue Dragon has helped bring about 400 trafficked women and girls home from China since 2007. They are among tens of thousands trafficked into China from impoverished pockets of Vietnam, Cambodia, Myanmar and Laos.  They are tricked, lured or kidnapped and sold as wives and prostitutes across the border, some ending up deep inside the tightly-controlled Communist country.  Rescues are a complicated and all-consuming job, says the Blue Dragon rescuer whose identity has been concealed for safety reasons. The stress is constant and the phone buzzes around the clock.  ""But I couldn't walk away,"" the rescuer says. ""Imagine your child didn't come home at dinner time. What would you do?"" - 'Please help me' - Victims reach out via Chinese messaging services like WeChat and QQ or call the non-profit -- if they can get their hands on a phone.  ""I was trafficked to China please help me,"" reads one text. ""I'm praying for a miracle,"" says another.  But most girls -- especially sex workers -- are barred from contact with the outside world; an escaped girl means thousands of dollars lost for traffickers. With risks high, each rescue can take months to plan and execute.  One girl faked illness and checked into hospital where she called Blue Dragon rescuers, leading them to a remote corner of China where she had been trafficked as a bride.  Another who had been sold into a brothel secretly used customers' phones to contact rescuers before evading bouncers by escaping via a back door.  Blue Dragon helps to bring home up to eight people a month and gets one or two desperate pleas for help each day.   The organisation keeps photos and videos of successful missions -- weeping mothers reunited with daughters, teenaged girls grinning widely after being saved -- morale-boosting reminders of their work. ""If we don't get her out of there she's stuck, she's in slavery,"" said Michael Brosowski, the Australian founder of Blue Dragon, which also rescues and rehabilitates street kids, sexual abuse victims and other kids in crisis.  - 'Alive again' - Le Thi Vu knew trying to escape could mean being beaten or even killed by her pimp, who kept her in a brothel for four months in China's Guangxi province where she was forced to sleep with up to 12 men a day.  Traumatised and fearing pregnancy, she secretly bought a phone and got in touch with her family who connected with Blue Dragon.   She had no idea of her location and could not read the Chinese street signs outside, but Vu -- whose name has been changed -- found a phone number for a hotel across the street and relayed it. One morning two months later, the rescue unfolded.  She went into a hair salon next to the brothel with another Vietnamese woman and suddenly made a dash for the waiting car, praying not to get caught.  Within days the pair were back in Vietnam.  ""I felt like I had come back to life again, I was so happy to see my mother,"" said Vu, now 21 and training to be a spa technician.  Rescues have helped Blue Dragon prosecute 76 traffickers over the past five years in Vietnam, where the maximum sentence for selling people outside the country is 20 years. Vu's traffickers -- her friend and her friend's boyfriend -- were both jailed.   Nguyen Trang was saved last year, eight months into a forced marriage to a poor Chinese labourer in Hunan province. She slipped out of the house early one morning to meet a Blue Dragon contact, who guided her onto a bus bound for the border.  She was offered $2,100 not to testify against her trafficker -- a former boyfriend who sold her to brokers in China. But Trang, also using a pseudonym, refused and her ex was jailed in August for seven years. Today, the slight 20-year-old works in a Hanoi restaurant and has tried to put the dark chapter behind her.  ""In Hunan my spirit hurt... now I can live again,"" she says. "

											Halting child trafficking remains tricky										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/1578266/halting-child-trafficking-remains-tricky,"One of the positive developments in Thailand in recent years has been the governmental commitment to eradicate human trafficking. It has been complemented by a spate of court cases against human traffickers, with some evident successes. Yet, there remains a challenging situation, particularly where children are the victims, compounded by the complexity of a transfrontier situation and the opacity of the vested interests behind the sex market. The country is now supported by an extensive policy and legal framework which provides the tools to take action. Thailand is a party to the main international treaty on the subject of human trafficking -- the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children, supplementing the UN Convention against Transnational Organised Crime (2000) (""Palermo Protocol""). This treaty defines ""trafficking in persons"" as comprising three elements; the criminal act (such as recruitment or transfer of a victim); the means used (such as coercion, deception or abuse of power); and the purpose based on exploitation (such as sexual exploitation and forced labour). In the case of child victims, however, it is not necessary to prove the second element (the means) and absolute protection is afforded to persons under 18 years old. Importantly, consent of the victim to the trafficking (whether adult or child) is immaterial, and the trafficker cannot use consent to rebut the claims of the victim. Furthermore, the Palermo Protocol calls for criminalisation of human trafficking, victim protection, safe repatriation, and prevention and cooperation measures, such as on border security. Implementation of this treaty in Thailand has been witnessed by the enactment of the Act on Prevention and Suppression of Trafficking in Persons (2008), with two subsequent amendments, most recently the Anti-Trafficking Act (2017). These laws follow the Palermo Protocol, while providing additions based on the Thai situation. In particular, the 2017 law spells out the notion of abuse of authority by bearing in mind the victim's physical and mental condition as well as educational level. Progressively, there has also been an increase in sanctions (fines, imprisonment and even the death penalty). In 2016, a law was also passed to lay down the procedures for dealing with human trafficking cases, with the establishment of court(s) to deal specifically with the crime of human trafficking, conferring more powers on the judges to undertake investigations (""inquisitorial role""), as well as expedited procedures targeting finalisation of cases in six months. These are supported by various national policies, most recently the human rights agenda adopted by the current administration, as well as the commitment to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. There is also a range of other laws that intersect with the anti-trafficking law, such as the Anti-Prostitution Act (1960) and the Criminal Code, remembering that the country is a party to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and its protocols. In cross-border cases, national immigration law comes into play. However, the immigration law stands astride the thin line between victim and wrongdoer; where a person crosses into Thailand without the proper papers and where it is unclear whether the person is a victim of human trafficking, such law might classify the person as an illegal immigrant, consequently leading to immigration detention. Nevertheless, there are now various Memoranda of Understanding between government and other agencies to shift victims of trafficking from the immigration authorities to the social welfare authorities and to house victims in the latter's shelters. A key challenge is how to identify the victims and how to ascertain their age, particularly to enable adequate protection to be accorded to children. While under the current national law and related procedure, the identification of the victim should be finalised within a week, this is hampered when it is not clear whether the person is under 18 years old. Should the age of the person be assessed through tests on the bones or teeth? Experiences from other regions, such as Europe, question the accuracy of tests based on bones/teeth, as there is a possible margin of error concerning the actual age of the person. What should not be forgotten is the need to consult the child, examine the background circumstances, and access the family to help confirm the age. In today's world, technology can also help, such as online communication with the country of origin and local communities. This is linked with situations where the victim claims to be over 18, when the reality may suggest otherwise. The interview process needs to be sensitive to the trauma already faced by the child and the pressures which may cause the child to be evasive, including over their real age, due to fear and apprehension. The environment facing the child may also inhibit the truth-seeking process: An interview at a police station hoping for quick results may be inappropriate if what the victim really needs is a comforting shelter to recover in before evidence-gathering begins. What if the person accused of exploiting a child claims that the latter had stated that they were over 18 and the accused believed them at the time of the incident, in addition to the fact that the person consented to the act of exploitation? The mere fact that a child claims that they are over 18 should not be definitive, and the presumption -- and benefit of the doubt -- should weigh in favour of the child. This is now the judicial position in other parts of the world; the accused is under strict liability to the child, irrespective of the latter's claim of being over 18 years old. Add to that the global position today that criminal responsibility arises in trafficking cases, irrespective of whether the victim consents to the act of exploitation.

Her arrest adds to a growing concern that the age of suspects in sex crimes is getting lower. At the age of 20, Phloiphan Mueangdit allegedly runs a sex trade, and procured the victim for the Japanese man, himself caught two days earlier at his condominium on Jomtien beach in Chon Buri's Bang Lamung district. Ms Phloiphan was detained after she was found on Wednesday by officers at a food shop in Soi Map Yai Lia 31 in the district. She was accused of luring an underage girl for a sex service, an act that will also implicate her in a human trafficking charge, according to investigators led by Pattaya police chief Pol Col Aphichai Kropphet. An initial investigation found another Thai male was also involved in the wrongdoing, police said. Police are making further probes so as to bring this male suspect to justice. On Monday, they nabbed Hiroyuki Nakashima at his room after finding the 71-year-old allegedly contacted Ms Phloiphan to send him an underage girl. Among items confiscated from his room were pornographic magazines, sex toys and a camera secretly installed on the ceiling. It is believed this was set up to record him having sex with the girl, police said. Earlier in June this year, a 17-year-old girl was arrested on a charge of providing a 14-year-old-girl to have sex with an Indian tourist in Pattaya while a teenage boy allegedly procured senior high-school students for six customers in Nakhon Sawan. In August, police nabbed a 19-year-old female for allegedly procuring a 15-year-old girl to provide sex services for a drug network in the northeastern province of Roi Et."

It has convinced everyone it is dragging its collective feet on the cases, on purpose. ACT is quite properly calling the NACC to act more responsibly. The two high-profile alleged corruption cases involve the current first Deputy Prime Minister, Gen Prawit Wongsuwon, and the former police chief, Pol Gen Somyot Poompunmuang. Gen Prawit has been officially ""under investigation"" over a collection of high-priced wristwatches and jewellery seen in his possession, and worth well over US$1 million. Pol Gen Somyot is directly tied up in a probe into a nasty case that involves child sex, sex trafficking and a loan of 300 million baht. The two cases aren't legally related. ACT linked them because they have other commonality. Both involve public figures of high visibility. Both spent their careers in public service, yet emerged as extremely well off. As ACT's every sentence of its Sunday criticism implied, it seems to the public as if the cases of Gen Prawit and Pol Gen Somyot involve figures too big to criticise, too important to indict.

The publisher of ""I Dare to Sleep Alone and I Learn to Control Myself"" apologised for causing any offence but said the book aimed to help parents teach children how to protect themselves from sexual harassment. The Education Ministry said the book, written by Fita Chakra, contained pornographic content and cited a depiction of a cartoon boy's thoughts as he hugs a bolster pillow when he can't sleep. It also includes a part where the boy finds a new game of putting his hand inside his trousers. ""The content of the book is not appropriate for children. It's too vulgar,"" the ministry said in a statement, adding the publisher must recall the book or face ""strict sanction"". Sex education in Indonesia, which has the world's largest Muslim population, is uncommon and casual conversations about sex are considered taboo. Awaluddin Tjalla, head of the ministry's centre of curriculum and books, also said the ministry was speaking to an association of publishers to urge it to take action against the publisher. He did not elaborate. The author was not immediately available for comment, but the publisher, Tiga Serangkai, said it had consulted psychologists as well as paediatricians when compiling the book. ""Our intention in launching the book was so that we can help parents explain to children about the importance of protecting themselves ... from people with ill-intention towards them,"" it said in a statement. The book also contained educational material on sexually transmitted diseases and ""basic knowledge that is important for a child to know from early age"", it said. On its Instagram account, Tiga Serangkai said: ""We understand that some in our society are not ready for sex education at an early age"", adding that those who had bought the book could return it and get a refund. The publisher said the book had been withdrawn since December, but that it had found copies still on sale in some online stores. Some Indonesians turned to social media to complain. An Instagram user with handler @revitatiaman said: ""I've seen a few pages of the book and I don't think there's any education in here. Only damaging a child's moral and brain."" ""It is better to soothe a kid who is learning to sleep by himself at night through reading or reciting a praying,"" said @pipijippie.

											Poll: Half of female revellers groped during Songkran										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/922377/poll-half-of-female-revellers-groped-during-songkran,"Just over half of the women and young girls surveyed complained they had been sexually harrassed during past Thai New Year water festivals, it was revealed at the launch of a ""Happy Songkran"" safety campaign on Tuesday. The survey involved 1,793 people, aged 10-40, in Bangkok, Nakhon Pathom, Samut Prakan, Chiang Mai, Lampang, Amnat Charoen, Chumphon, Chon Buri and Khon Kaen, said Charee Srisawat, of the Women and Men Progressive Movement Foundation. It found that 51.9% of the respondents said they had been sexually harassed by drunken men taking part in Songkran celebrations, The big majority of the respondents, about 86%, said they disliked the sexual harassment and wanted  steps taken to stop it. The remaining 14% felt it was normal and that such behaviour was acceptable, said Ms Charee. The majority wanted wanted authorities to seriously enforce the law and address the problem during the festival. Booths could be set up at festival venues to receive public complaints of sexual harassment and safe areas could be designated, the activist said. She urged people to celebrate Songkran in a constructive way. The survey clearly showed that most women saw sexual harassment during the festival as unacceptable, Ms Charee said. Men should respect the rights of women regarding body touching. Ms Charee revealed the results of the survey during an activity on Tuesday organised by the foundation, the Metropolitan Police Bureau’s children and women welfare sub-division, and the Thai Health Promotion Foundation (ThaiHealth) to campaign for safety during the festival under the theme, ""Happy Songkran….no alcohol, no sexual harassment and no violence.’’ Punika Apirakkraisri, of Thammasat Unversity’s Lampang centre, said the poll showed the Songkran festival had became a platform for sexual harassment and that some people saw such acts as normal. She pointed to the 14% of respondents who said being groped was acceptable. A 24-year-old Bangkok woman said she had been sexually harassed by a group of male youths during the festival. They had thrown water at her and some of them put talcum powder on her face, and used this opportunity to touch her breasts and further down her body. She shouted for help and scolded her attackers. However, the youths clearly did not feel any guilt, the woman said."

											US report calls out 'severe' curbs on human rights										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/605120/us-report-calls-out-evere-curbs-on-human-rights,"Thailand has seen ""severe"" restrictions on freedom of expression, assembly and the media since last year's military coup, while human rights problems persist in the Far South, the United States concluded in its annual human rights report released in Washington Thursday. In its compendium of reports about the human-rights situation during 2014 in countries around the world, the US State Department chronicles the sweeping changes imposed by the military, detailing the ""numerous decrees severely limiting civil liberties, including restrictions on freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, and freedom of the press"". The report states no outright opinions or judgements on the events that transpired last year. In fact, in introducing the report, Secretary of State John Kerry said it was not intended to be ""sanctimonious,"" as every country, including the United States, had room for improvement. ""We couldn't help but have humility when we have seen what we have seen in the last year in terms of racial discord and unrest. So we approach this with great self-awareness,"" he said. But in the preface to the report, Mr Kerry placed Thailand  alongside China, Egypt, Iran, Russia and Saudi Arabia as countries that  were stifling the development of civil society. ""The military overthrew a democratically elected government,  repealed the constitution, and severely limited civil liberties,"" he said. ""Subsequent efforts by the military government to rewrite the  country's constitution and recast its political intuitions raised  concerns about lack of inclusivity in the process."" The lengthy chapter on Thailand details the long list of curbs put in place since May 22 as well as rights concerns that remained unresolved under democratic governments. The report notes that, since the coup, 900 political leaders, academics and journalists have been temporarily detained. At the same time, the US noted the marked increase in lese majeste cases brought under Section 112 of the Criminal Code for defaming the monarchy. ""The interim constitution, promulgated on July 22, set the framework for the adoption of a new constitution but did not provide citizens the ability to change their government peacefully,"" the US writes. ""Instead, it established a process in which unelected individuals would serve as interim legislators and a separate appointed body would draft a new constitution."" Other human rights problems cited include ""arbitrary arrests and detention; poor, overcrowded, and unsanitary prison and detention facilities; insufficient protection for vulnerable populations, including refugees; violence and discrimination against women; sex tourism; sexual exploitation of children; trafficking in persons; discrimination against persons with disabilities, minorities, hill tribe members, and foreign migrant workers; child labour; and some limitations on worker rights."" US Secretary of State John Kerry departs after speaking at a briefing on the ""2014 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices"" at the State Department on June 25 in Washington. (AFP photo) A large percentage of the report was dedicated to the continuing strife in the three southernmost provinces. ""The most persistent human rights problems consisted of abuses by government security forces and local defence volunteers,"" the State Department wrote, calling out ""occasional excessive use of force by security forces, including police killing, torturing, and otherwise abusing criminal suspects, detainees, and prisoners"". Police and military abuses got special attention, with the report's authors citing specific cases of alleged torture, including the case of two Myanmar men accused of the murder and rape of two British backpackers on Koh Tao in September. ""Official impunity, however, continued to be a serious problem, especially in provinces where the 2005 Emergency Decree and the 2008 Internal Security Act (ISA) remained in effect,"" the report said, noting that insurgents in the south also ""continued to commit human rights abuses, including attacks on civilian targets"". State Department Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor writers spent considerable portions of their 2014 Thailand assessment on detention and arbitrary arrest of coup dissenters, as well as insurgency suspects in the South. ""After the coup, security forces detained hundreds of activists and in some instances withheld information about their safety for brief periods before announcing their whereabouts,"" the report states, singling out the case of Kittisak Soomsri at a teacher-training centre in Bangkok. He was held for six days before being named one of the ""men in black"" who allegedly initiated violent acts during the 2010 street protests. In the far South, ""emergency decree provisions make it very difficult to challenge a detention before a court"", the report concludes. ""Under the decree, detainees should have access to legal counsel, but in practice, there was no assurance of prompt access to counsel or family members, nor were there transparent safeguards against the mistreatment of detainees."" Furthermore, the US states, security forces are given blanket protection against prosecution for anything they do while on duty, military and police officials do not always provide suspects, particularly indigent ones, with free counsel as required by law, and the process for obtaining arrest warrants is flawed. ""The system for issuing arrest warrants was subject to misuse by police as well as a judicial tendency to approve automatically all requests for warrants,"" the State Department said.  ""The law provides for access to counsel for criminal detainees, but lawyers and human rights groups claimed police often conducted interrogations without providing access to an attorney,"" the report states, adding that when free counsel is provided it was on an ""intermittent, voluntary basis"" and ""of low quality"". The US also highlights numerous cases in which Thai police allegedly use torture to coerce confessions and took particular note of the near daily re-enactments suspects are forced to perform in front of media and the public. ""There were continued reports that security forces at times used excessive and lethal force against criminal suspects and committed or were connected to extrajudicial, arbitrary, and unlawful killings,"" the report said, noting that ""police, military, and other agencies killed 45 suspects during the arrest process"". ""The interim constitution protects 'all human dignity, rights, [and] liberties', but it does not specifically prohibit torture. Credible nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and legal entities continued to report that police and military officials occasionally tortured and beat suspects to obtain confessions, and newspapers continued to report numerous cases of citizens accusing police and other security officials of brutality."" Soldiers close skywalk near Bangkok Art Centre to prevent an anti-coup protest June 1. (Photo by Pattarapong Chatpattarasill) Two cases that drew special attention in that section of the report included the disappearance and suspected killing of ethnic Karen activist Porlajee ""Billy"" Rakchongcharoen and the 29-day detention and alleged torture of red-shirt leader Kritsuda Khunasen. It also highlighted the torture claims of two Myanmar nationals accused of killing two British tourists in September. They too were forced to re-enact their alleged murders. ""Although police regulations require that suspects 'confess' before re-enactments, police often obtained these 'confessions' by coercion, including physical assault. Human rights organisations criticised forced re-enactments because they violate the presumption of innocence and encourage violence against suspects."" Once criminal suspects pass through police stations, human rights problems continue, the US said in the report. ""Conditions in prisons and various detention centres -- including drug rehabilitation facilities and immigration detention centres -- remained poor and most were overcrowded. In some prisons sleeping accommodations were insufficient, the lack of medical care was a serious problem, and communicable diseases were widespread."" Finally, the report makes special note of the increase in prosecutions under the lese majeste law, noting ""international and domestic human rights organizations and academics expressed concern over the chilling effect on freedom of expression"". The US said it was listing human rights concerns even as nongovernmental organisations in Thailand have been impeded in their efforts to address them under the junta. ""NGOs that dealt with sensitive political matters, such as opposition to government-sponsored development projects or border matters, faced periodic harassment,"" the US said. ""Human rights workers focusing on violence in the southern provinces were particularly vulnerable to harassment and intimidation by government agents and militant groups. The government accorded very few NGOs tax-exempt status, which sometimes hampered their ability to secure adequate funding."" Thailand certainly was not alone in being criticised by the US report for human rights abuses, with China, Myanmar, Cuba and Iran targeted with more-pointed comments. The State Department report criticised Tehran for having the second-highest execution rate in the world and said proceedings often did not comply with constitutional protections. On Cuba, the department said that while Havana had largely eased travel restrictions in January, the government still denied passport requests for certain opposition figures, or harassed them upon their return to the country. The report criticised Myanmar, with which the United States has been working hard to improve relations, saying abuses of minority Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine State remained ""severely troubling"" despite a ""broader trend of progress since 2011"" in the country."
41,2015-01-27 06:00:00,Permanent scars of violence,https://www.bangkokpost.com/life/social-and-lifestyle/460755/permanent-scars-of-violence,"It can be said that no one else in the world could ever love a child more than the parents. While that statement is usually true, on the flip side of the coin, it is often the child's own parents who inflict the greatest pain through acts of violence. After all, it always hurts more to be hurt by someone near and dear to you. The print advert for the 'End Violence Against Children' campaign. According to the Ministry of Public Health, in 2013, about 19,000 Thai children were victims of violence, 70% of which was sexual harassment. Among children under five, most violence was carried out by parents. Those numbers came from data collected from hospitals nationwide, meaning they only represent children who were treated in hospital. That's just the tip of the colossal iceberg — many other cases were left unreported. Another recent study also revealed that 50% of Thai children surveyed said they had experienced violent punishment by their parents, caretakers or teachers. Even sadder is the fact that many of those children believed it was their fault. Unicef and the Ministry of Social Development and Human Security recently kicked off the ""End Violence Against Children"" campaign to create awareness about the negative impacts of corporal punishment and other violent actions on children. ""Violence against children persists because it is often accepted by adults, and the children themselves, as part of life,"" said Bijaya Rajbhandari, representative for Unicef Thailand. ""It doesn't only harm the well-being of children, but also undermines the productivity and prosperity of the country as a whole."" According to Rajbhandari, most violence against children takes place behind closed doors, undetected and unreported. Many adults have seemingly logical explanations for their violence, unaware of the negative impact on the child. The definition of violence does not just include hitting someone. There are many other forms of violence: seeing parents fighting aggressively, verbal abuse, being neglected, or having to carry too much expectation. Like corporal punishment, these actions too can affect children's physical and mental health. Sirirath Chunnasart, child protection officer of Unicef Thailand, said many parents often say that they hit their children because they want to teach them a lesson. Scientific evidence confirms that it's the opposite. ""Naturally, when children are being physically punished, the fright activates the part of the brain responsible for the fight-or-flight response, not the frontal part which learns logic,"" she said. ""The child would only learn how to avoid being hit the next time."" For parents who argue that they have turned out well-adjusted only because they were spanked as children, Sirirath pointed out that such reasoning cannot be proven, and is therefore not a logical argument. ""Who knows? You might have turned out even better if you had never been physically punished,"" she said. Studies have shown that children who have suffered from violence have an increased risk of mental health disorders, depression, anxiety, self-harm and suicide. Violence also impairs the ability to learn and socialise and increases the chance of children engaging in risky sexual behaviours and becoming violent adults. Dr Panpimol Wipulakorn, deputy director-general, Department of Mental Health, cited a recent survey by the Ministry of Social Development and Human Security, which surveyed 30,000 children and 20,000 adults. All of them admitted violence had been a part of their upbringing, whether it was spanking, yelling, name calling, threatening or other mistreatments. ""To stop this problem, blaming the parents is not going to work, because by blaming them, we are also using a violence. The best way is to educate parents, teachers, caretakers, and society as a whole about the negative consequence of violence against children,"" she said. The End Violence Against Children campaign urges the public to stop all forms of violence and adopt a positive, disciplined approach to raising children. The campaign will be promoted through several channels such as TV commercials, nationwide roadshow activities and online. Visit www.endviolencethailand.org "

											Schools should be a safe haven from discrimination										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/410361/schools-should-be-a-safe-haven-from-discrimination,"Millions of Thai public school students headed back to class last week, ideally, to a safe and nurturing learning environment. However, the reality for LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) students in Thailand is often far from ideal. School run: Almost a quarter of bullied pupils describe themselves as ‘depressed’. For many of these youngsters, returning to school means re-entering a world where dealing with the fear of being bullied and of verbal, physical and even sexual abuse, all too often overwhelms their ability to learn, leaving them vulnerable to long-term social problems and health risks. A study conducted by Plan International, Unesco and Mahidol University was released to coincide with yesterday’s International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia and contains disconcerting findings on the issue. In total, 31% of students who identified themselves as LGBT reported having experienced physical abuse, 29% were targets of verbal abuse and 24% said they faced sexual harassment because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. The study, the first of its kind in Thailand, collected data from more than 2,000 students from five provinces in four regions through a computerised, self-administered survey. A further 450 people, including students, teachers and school administrators shared insights through in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. Those surveyed spoke of being exposed to a range of abusive behaviours at school that fit the commonly accepted definition of bullying. This included abuse that was verbal (name-calling, both online and in person), physical (slapping and kicking), social (being excluded or ostracised) and sexual (unwanted touching) in nature. Many LGBT students said that even going to the toilet at school was an ordeal, since they were not accepted at washrooms designated for either sex. Those who didn’t identify with their biological sex expressed frustration at being prevented from wearing the uniforms and hairstyles to match their gender identity. According to the study, 7% of those bullied said they had attempted suicide in the past year, while 23% suffered from depression. Anxiety, low self-esteem, withdrawal and social isolation were some of the other toxic side effects of bullying on these young people. These psychological after effects pose other threats to their physical well-being. Victims of bullying are more susceptible to engaging in illegal drug use and unprotected sex, increasing their risk of exposure to HIV. Fear of further discrimination and abuse means they are often less likely to access potentially life-saving HIV and sexual and reproductive health services and information. Safeguards for young people and efforts to respond to this complex issue need to be increased. After interviewing administrators and teachers for the study, researchers found that most schools lack a general anti-bullying policy, let alone one that focuses on LGBT students. Bullies are often punished at the discretion of teachers. In some cases, victims said they were accused of inviting the bullying behaviour upon themselves. Change, however, appears to be within reach. During the course of the study and since its completion, teachers and school administrators expressed a wish to have access to learning materials that can help them respond more effectively to the needs of the LGBT community and improve their learning environment. Unesco and its partners responded to that call by launching lesson plans last week that can be used all year round to bring discussions on sexual and gender diversity into the classroom. Further work to build teacher capacity to address these issues is also under way through a strengthened partnership between Unesco and Plan Thailand, with support from the Netherlands Ministry of Education, Culture and Science and the Swedish International Development Agency. The idea is to promote a “whole-school approach” to tackling bullying, that aims to make all schools safe havens for learning. We need to raise awareness around this often ignored or discounted issue. To that end, Unesco Bangkok, UN Aids Asia and the Pacific, and regional youth networks Youth Voices Count and Youth Lead joined up last week for the first “School Rainbow” campaign. Chalk rainbows have been drawn in front of schools throughout Bangkok by students, teachers and school staff, as well as members of the community to show support to end discrimination and bullying targeting young LGBT people. It is hoped that the rainbows appearing throughout the city will serve as a symbol of respect for diversity, and also as a symbol of renewal for the system in which we educate our children.

											Our domestic violence shame won't go away										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/379524/our-domestic-violence-shame-won-t-go-away,"For most Thais, Monday was an emotionally tumultuous day because of the Preah Vihear ruling and the increasingly heated political situation that risks plunging the country into another round of violent conflict. After monitoring the news all day, the latent stress that kept me awake that night was not thinking about the Bangkok Post's front-page reports the next day on the Preah Vihear ruling or the escalation of mass protests. It was a piece of news tucked away on Page 5 under this headline: ""Mother-in-law confesses ordering Jakkrit's murder"". More precisely, the troubling question was what I - as a mother - would have done had I been in her shoes. That story involves the high-profile murder of national sports shooter Jakkrit Panichpatikum, a macho athlete who was notorious for his violent outbursts and wife-beating scandals. In mid-July, he was briefly put behind bars for a shooting spree at the family home. It was his own mother, Mrs Boonkid, who took Jakkrit's wife, Nitiwadee Pucharoenyos, to seek help from the police. He was subsequently charged with attempted murder, assault, illegal possession of firearms and committing violent acts. According to news reports at the time, his mother said Jakkrit beat up his wife, threatened her and their children at gunpoint, barred his wife from leaving the house, shot at her and one of the children, and used a stun gun on her. Mrs Boonkid said Jakkrit also suffered paranoia from use of narcotics. Obviously, the wife had been subjected to horrific domestic violence for years. And no one in the family could stop him. ""I couldn't stand it any more,"" she was quoted as saying in the Bangkok Post's Spectrum magazine. ""I told her to leave the house, but my son threatened to kill them all and everyone in the house if she left. That is why she stayed put."" Jakkrit was eventually released on bail after he publicly vowed to his family to turn over a new leaf. Obviously, that did not last long. He returned to the headlines when he charged his wife for opening his safe at the bank without his approval. Last month, he was gunned down by a motorcycle pillion rider. On Monday, his mother-in-law, 70-year-old Surang Duangjinda, turned herself in at a media-packed news event. She confessed to hiring the gunman to kill Jakkrit in order to protect her daughter from further abuses. What followed was an explosion of I-am-the-judge comments on social media vilifying both Mrs Surang and her daughter Dr Nitiwadee. Wife-beating is bad, they said, but murder is much worse. They also didn't believe that the mother-in-law acted alone without complicity from her daughter, thinking that the duo were after their sports hero's money despite the fact that Dr Nitiwadee is a rich woman from running her beauty clinic. They also dismissed Dr Nitiwadee's plea for society to pay heed to the problem of domestic violence which destroyed her family. If their hero was that bad, they argued, Dr Nitiwadee should have left him long ago. ""Why stay?"" they asked. Jakkrit's father, a former shooting sportsman, also told a TV programme that wife-beating is an ""ordinary matter"" in family life. He reportedly added that the couple couldn't have lasted for six years had they both not been ""sadists"". If anything, such comments echo the total lack of understanding of how chronic wife-beating paralyses the victims with helplessness and fear. They are also part of the blame-the-victim mindset which perpetuates all forms of sexual violence from rape and wife-beating to sexual harassment. At the news conference, a reporter asked Mrs Surang why she did what she did. ""When I saw my daughter got hurt, as a mother I felt much more pain inside,"" she replied. After six years of seeing her daughter being trapped in a helpless situation that only got worse, the assault which resulted in her daughter's miscarriage was the last straw. ""I'm an old woman. The main thing I want in my life is to see my daughter happy, my grandchildren too. Do you understand the feelings of a mother?"" she asked. There is one woman who does. It's Jakkrit's own mother, Mrs Boonkid. ""I understand how a mother feels, ""she said in her quiet grief. As long as wife-beating is still seen as an ""ordinary matter"" in family life as Jakkrit's father and many online commentators feel, women's grief from domestic violence will see no end.
