published : 13 Jul 2020 at 10:30,To catch an online predator,https://www.bangkokpost.com/life/social-and-lifestyle/1950500/to-catch-an-online-predator,"Sending a half-naked photo of herself to her new Facebook admirer, a boy she thought was 15, felt like a flirtatious move that 14-year-old Ned* believed would show she was serious about having a romantic relationship with the handsome teen whose photoshopped profile photo made him out to be a stud. Little did she realise that pressing the send button would lead to serious consequences because the young man who she believed she had fallen in love with was an online child predator looking to con young women into sending intimate photos in the guise of a blossoming romance. The next day, her suggestive photo was shared in a private Line group for paedophiles and just about anybody else interested in looking at lewd photos of young girls. The incident drove her into a state of depression, which was further exacerbated by the stress of having to keep up with her school lessons via remote learning at the height of Covid-19. She was overwhelmed with a sense of dread and the thought that such private photos were now being made public. The thought of the photos remaining on the internet until she was old and grey only added to her misery and predicament over how she would deal with the consequences of her actions. Ned's encounter with online child predators amid the Covid-19 pandemic has been shared by numerous other youngsters in the last three months, according to a recent report by the Thailand Internet Crimes Against Children Taskforce (TICAC), which launched a nationwide cyber sting operation targeting online predators with support from local and international law enforcement agencies and NGOs. What was uncovered during the investigation was troubling, to say the least. For one, the global pandemic has done little to deter perpetrators from the online exploitation of countless children who are at home during Covid-19, putting them at higher risk of online criminal activity as they spent more time online. Over the past two months, the TICAC has rescued over 100 children from online cybersex predators, a considerable spike when compared to the total of 53 underage victims that the TICAC rescued from online sexual abuse in the whole of 2018, which at that time was the highest annual figure since the organisation was created in 2016. Since the middle of April this year alone, officials have seized more than 150,000 files of underage pornographic and abuse materials. In an exclusive interview with Life, Pol Lt Gen Jaruvat Vaisaya, assistant police commissioner-general, and TICAC leader said conducting a sting operation of such a nature during Covid-19 had its set of complications due to curfew, social distancing, and self-quarantine requirements, but that overall the sting operation has been a success. Sharing their findings, he continued: ""What we discovered was that during the work from home period, there was an increase in internet usage in several households. Concurrently, lax adult supervision left a loophole for online cybersex predators, most of whom are already on the prowl to abuse children. This led to predators using all sorts of child grooming tactics to lure children after a level of trust has been formed. ""In terms of technology, we found that perpetrators used state-of-the-art gadgets, which made our work all the more challenging when it came to the gathering of evidence. TICAC officers hard at work. Catching online predators has many challenges.  Courtesy of TICAC ""The widespread availability and affordability of high-speed internet and the rise in mobile phone ownership among young people has made the situation even more precarious during Covid-19. ""In terms of tips received on our TICAC and Facebook platforms, we used to average approximately 120,000 each year in the past, however, during the height of Covid-19, which lasted for three months, we received a whopping 160,000 tips in that timeframe alone."" Jaruvat further remarked that in the nearly five years since TICAC has been active, the youngest-ever victim found was four years old. Most of the minors come from dysfunctional and poor backgrounds. ""Predators often prey on children who are the most vulnerable. We also found that many among them suffer from depression. With the internet being readily accessible, these children are often the first to get lured by predators. ""Knowing well that children aren't going to school, predators are taking advantage of this and looking to earn income by exploiting them for their gain. Many of the business dealings they have with potential clients also transpire over the internet, so time is of the essence in our line of work."" Jaruvat said this particular sting operation highlighted the importance of information gathering by the public who sent them tips and clues to catch cybersex predators and people who use the internet to exploit children. The senior officer remarked that the need for information plays a pivotal role in capturing criminals red-handed. However, the information they receive is often incomplete, so officers have to spend a substantial amount of time searching for these missing links. Needless to say, this is a time-consuming task, he said, and as TICAC has a limited number of officers and rising caseload, this can become an obstacle to getting to the victims in time. ""While we are grateful for the tips sent to us, I would request people to find as much information as they can gather about the alleged crime. Some questions to keep in mind are: What happened? Where did the crime occur, when did it take place, and who is the victim? ""If we can receive as many clues to the aforementioned questions, our investigation can move much faster so the perpetrator(s) can be caught before they can get to more children.'' A non-government organisation that has worked closely with TICAC and was a part of their recent sting operation is The Hug Project, a charity that assists trafficked children and has advocated the need for the government to provide better care and education to young people using the internet in schools and at home. Reflecting on the cases, Wirawan Mosby, director of The Hug Project remarked: ""The most disturbing cases are when the victims are so young. We have a case of a young boy who was only seven years old when he was sexually abused and he lived near the offender. The boy went to play computer games at the offender's house. He was sexually abused and then the offender took a photo of him and posted it all over social media. ""Another disturbing case that we received was about a baby being raped. I always think the worst in such cases and have nightmares about how the baby was murdered by the abuser. ""What makes this emotionally unsettling is the fact we do not know who the baby was. We can only locate the person who posted the video but not the source of the video, which could have been produced outside of Thailand."" Speaking on how Thai society, law enforcement, and how the government has played an integral role in addressing the issue of child grooming, Wirawan said: ""I believe that the government is doing a good job by having established TICAC because children now have access to law enforcement who specialise in these types of crimes by utilising the child victim-centric approach. ""Local police still have limited ability to handle these types of cases since they have less access to data and resources. ""TICAC has already worked tirelessly on assisting a number of these victims but the high volume of cases makes it quite challenging and numbers seem to be increasing."" Currently, TICAC is working in partnership with seven NGOs throughout Thailand. TICAC and the Child Advocacy Center, including The Hug Project, work especially close to protect children. Wirawan said that while outside factors related to online cybersex exploitation of minors include widespread availability and affordability of high-speed internet and rise in mobile phone ownership, predators target young children online, specifically teenagers, because they are at an age where they are curious. She added: ""Despite knowing the dangers that lurk, teenagers allow their curiosity to get the better of them. Still, we believe prevention is key. The sad part is that many children are groomed and tricked online since predators use the child's vulnerability and romantic fantasy to get them to do what they want."" Having worked closely with child victims and their families through the years, Wirawan shared a few suggestions on how parents and guardians of underage children can keep their loved ones safe from the prying eyes of predators. ""Parents should do their best to educate themselves and their children on the issues that arise due to this. Predators' strategies are always changing so we should follow the news to learn about those new strategies. Parents should also check their children's devices regularly to see if there are any strangers or people who they have not met in person that has tried to communicate with them on social media,"" she said. ""Children should also be educated about safe touch, unsafe touch, and confusing touch. If any adult touches the child and makes them feel uncomfortable, they should be empowered to say ""no"" without being regarded as rude. ""At a systematic level, the Ministry of Education should enforce child protection policies and internet safety protocols throughout Thailand."" *Not her real name."

											Online safety for children is everyone's responsibility										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/1459937/online-safety-for-children-is-everyones-responsibility,"Shutting children away behind closed doors, away from prying eyes and with no internet, can protect them up to a point. But preventing children from engaging with the world hurts their development in the long run. Children need fair, proper and manageable protection from online harm, and that requires collaboration between children, parents, society, businesses and the government, say experts who spoke at a recent event held by the Thai Electronic Transactions Development Agency. Messenger Kids, introduced by Facebook for children as young as six years, was among the topics discussed. A Facebook representative at the event declined to comment, but Andrea Hargrave, director-general of the London-based International Institute of Communications, said applications designed especially for children are not a bad idea in themselves. But business is business, and that's where things get tricky. ""I am sure [products specialised for children] are helpful because they allow children to communicate within a safe space that you know you can trust, like Disney,"" she told Asia Focus. ""But the point is, somebody is obviously making money out of this and they are making money out of your kids' data. ""Parents are caught between a rock and a hard place but you don't just stop them from using [the internet] completely because I don't think you would want to do that. Just as children need to learn how to cross the road, they need to learn how to navigate the digital world."" Many of the efforts related to child safety come from the traditional media content world, which is accustomed to regulation in various forms, but ""this is a different world"", she said. ""We all have to take more responsibility as parents than we have in the past. We need to collaborate and work with industries because industries want you to buy their products and if you walk away from their products, they do not have a business anymore. And that is why Facebook has taken on a number of moderators."" Even though the IT giants are making money from specialised products for children through advertising and selling of data, they are trying to help parents at least understand what they can do to mitigate some of the bigger risks, she said. Kaspersky Lab, a multinational cybersecurity provider, identifies seven dangers that children face online: cyberbullying, cyber predators, posting private information, phishing (emails that try to trick people into clicking on malicious links), falling for scams, accidentally downloading malware, and posts that come back to haunt a child later in life since deleting something forever from the internet is nearly impossible. Kaspersky recommends that parents talk more to their children about what is happening in their lives so they can be alert to bullying or predators. They should remind them that mum and dad can see what they post online, but that they ""don't snoop"". Children can be told about how people can steal private information such as a home address for malicious purposes. Even though your children are smart enough not to send money to Nigerian princes, they might fall for scams that offer things they may want, such as free access to online games in return for parents' credit card information, according to Kaspersky. Parents need to deliver the age-old caution to children about offers that sound too good to be true. Ms Hargrave agrees that safety starts with talking to children, but monitoring their use of devices is difficult. ""For example, is your child allowed to take an iPad to bed because they want to play some games? And at what age do you give your child a smartphone?"" In the UK, many children are allowed to independently use smartphones when they reach secondary school because they are travelling on their own to school. But increasingly, younger children are getting smartphones because of ""peer pressure"" that parents should try to resist, she said. The formal education system also has a role to play. ""I think that in Thailand you have enormous opportunity. It is a country that respects teachers and learning and I also think teachers need to be helped to understand what the issues are in the way that parents do."" Canada and Singapore, in her view, are the most advanced countries in terms of media literacy. In Singapore, experts have been teaching safe use of the internet in schools for two decades. Parents' associations often discuss online safety. ""I am sure you can do something like that here,"" she said. Because private companies are the ""gatekeepers"" of the internet, the public should be able to trust them to deal with some of the problems that arise, said Dr Joan Barata, founder of the Vienna-based consultancy CommVisions. ""On the other hand, I also believe that in order to perform that important task, these private companies need direction from the government because in some cases, government institutions ... are better suited to define what is in the public interest or what is acceptable and what is not,"" he said. In addition to heeding guidance from public bodies, private companies need input from parents and civil society organisations on community standards. ""In many cases you cannot have just one petrified code, but more like a set of rules that needs to be able to adapt to circumstances. In many cases, only thanks to feedback can you know that you are doing your work properly and make good judgements,"" said Dr Barata. Dr Masato Kajimoto, a journalism professor and founder of the Asia Pacific Digital Citizens Network, favours educating children in media literacy over heavy regulation. Children can be taught how to self-regulate, he said, based on what seems to be working in Japan, where media literacy is part of the public school curriculum. ""My recommendation is to find a way for media literacy education to be integrated into the public education system in one way or another. It could be just 15 minutes every two weeks for those aged between 7 and 17,"" he told Asia Focus. For the younger age group, Dr Kajimoto recommends teaching empathy and ethical behaviour to reduce cyberbullying. Older children can be taught to think more analytically about content by answering questions. On seeing a popular TV show, for example, they could be asked: why do you think this drama is popular, why was it created, why does it appeal emotionally? ""What we do with high school and university students is almost pure journalism, including fact checking and verification, and the same thing can be done for entertainment content but slightly different because it is mostly made up,"" he said. ""These kinds of analyses of media content could probably help them develop critical thinking skills that they could use to protect themselves from cyber harm."""
published : 8 Jan 2018 at 04:30,The predator next door,https://www.bangkokpost.com/life/social-and-lifestyle/1392254/the-predator-next-door,"Enticed by the pretty face who sent him a Facebook friend request, 14-year-old Boom* struck up a friendship online with an imposter, a 20-year-old ladyboy who was posing as a teen heartthrob. One thing led to another, and the unsuspecting Boon fell head over heels in love with a person he believed was a woman over a video live chat. The imposter gained the boy's trust to the point that he got carried away and masturbated while on one of their live chats unaware he was being recorded. The ladyboy sold the clip of the boy on Twitter. Boon's school friends eventually got a hold of this clip and he became the laughingstock of the school. The embarrassment took a toll on the teen and his grades started to fall, and he fell into depression. His parents eventually got wind of what had happened and took him to file a complaint at the police station. Pol Col Thakoon Nimsomboon, head of the TICAC operations team, left, and Pol Col Soonthorn Arunnara, leader of the TICAC northeastern team. Photo: YVONNE BOHWONGPRASERT It was at this juncture that Thailand Internet Crimes Against Children (TICAC) task force were notified. They contacted the US embassy in Thailand for help, and finally traced the Facebook and Twitter accounts to a ladyboy in Khon Kaen province. ""This is one among many criminal cases on the internet that TICAC has investigated through painstaking dedication, perseverance and team work, "" said Pol Col Thakoon Nimsomboon, head of operations team. ""Usually the victims are emotionally and physically in a bad shape when we reach them. As a father myself, it is disturbing to witness the trauma these children undergo. Someone has to get the work done, so we are determined to do all that is in our power to first rescue the child victim and than catch the perpetrators. Even though we have to sit through hours of footage of vile acts being done on children to determine the location or name of the victim."" Thakoon, who has a doctorate in criminal justice from a US-based university, said he hopes to increase awareness of child predators lurking online. Parents and teachers in particular have to be on alert, he said, because children today are computer savvy and mature earlier than previous generations. Alarmingly, while child and adult pornography is widely accessible on the internet, very little has been done globally to protect children from becoming victims, he said. Members of the task force. Photo courtesy of Thailand Internet Crimes Against Children [TICAC] He suggested data be kept on criminals and shared with the public when deemed necessary. Adding that while government-run agencies have began this process, it is still in its infancy stage. The public has the right to know if they are safe among their neighbours. To make his point, Thakoon shared a case where a young woman was raped and murdered by a man who lived next door to her. The case raised concerns at many levels, he said. ""Doesn't everyone have the right to know if they are safe where they live so they can take precautions. If I have a young daughter, it is my right to know as a father that the man who has rented the flat next to mine is not a paedophile. ""We can no longer brush this issue under the carpet by saying people who have served a jail sentence especially for heinous crimes have the right to not inform the public when they are released."" Another disturbing observation made by Thakoon was the young age of paedophiles he came to meet during his investigations, contrary to the popular belief that paedophiles are old men. The youngest he has come across was only 15. The Thai teenager had begun targeting toddlers years earlier. ""I was rather taken aback to see this young man tell me how he was sexually aroused by three-year-old children. Before meeting him, I had presumed paedophiles to be much older,"" he said. ""Some of the youngest victims are just a couple of months old."" Offenders come from all walks of life and nationalities. Some are from highly respected careers. Thakoon said the public and government have to work together to build a society where people have the right to reside in a safe environment. Pol Col Soonthorn Arunnara leads the TICAC team in the northeast. The law enforcement officer is credited for playing a pivotal role in amending the law stipulating penalties for the possession of child pornography. He said the most challenging aspect of his work with TICAC was to observe society's indifference towards children. He based this assumption on how criminal cases are prioritised. Raising the rape/murder of Nong Cartoon, the six-year-old who was murdered by a man who had previously killed 10 children, he said: ""This case, while making headline news, did little to stir up support to protect our children, in contradiction to drug-related cases where there is huge support. Criminal minds use these loopholes for their benefit. TICAC was set up in part to see that our children take first priority."" In terms of evidence, he said that when law enforcement work on crimes that are committed online, there is often not as such tangible evidence as they would see in a drug-related case, so it is plausible this could put people off showing a greater amount of interest in addressing crimes of a sexual nature involving children. Soonthorn said the attitude Thais have towards child pornography was also troubling. During the amending of the law stipulating penalties for the possession of child pornography, he said he received a barrage of criticism from the public for his stance. ""By and large the attitude was 'what's the big deal', this really made it all the more necessary for me to see it become law,"" Soonthorn said. ""Thai society still views the situation of watching child pornography in a light-hearted manner. They feel it is OK to watch because they are not physically touching the child."" To address the issue of cyber crime against children, both officers suggest parents and teachers work closely to offer mentors for different age groups, so when an issue arises, children are able to be counselled by a reliable person. Instead of totally depending on police to keep them safe, they should form neighbourhood watch groups. As parents themselves, both felt it was up to fathers and mothers to foster better ties with their children, saying: ""Parents have to teach children about the birds and the bees before they learn it from people with ill intentions. Keep a close tab on the websites kids are on today. If you build trust with your child, there is little to worry."" - TICAC task force, set up on Jan 8, 2016, is supported by the FBI and the US Department of Homeland Security, and designed to share intelligence. - There are currently 135 officers, 114 men and 21 women, working around the clock. - Utilising a US model, TICAC combats sexual exploitation facilitated via the internet. For instance, Thai law enforcement officials just started working directly with the US National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children to share real-time information about victims and offenders. - Once victims are detected, the next step is providing them with assistance, standard practice for the FBI. - For TICAC, victim assistance is not just the morally correct course of action, it provides information that helps police more effectively investigate lawbreakers.

											Online task force closes the net on paedophiles										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/special-reports/1292363/online-task-force-closes-the-net-on-paedophiles,"A schoolboy came to the police with a broken heart. He was utterly embarrassed but decided to tell police that a video clip of him masturbating had been distributed online and he wanted it removed. It transpired that he had fallen in love with a beautiful woman he met on the internet. They developed their relationship through video live chat, he got carried away and pleasured himself without knowing he was being recorded. He later found he was the victim of a group of transvestites who stole other people's pictures and created fake identities to lure young men like him in order to blackmail them. An investigation by the Thailand Internet Crimes Against Children (TICAC) Task Force found over 100 such video clips and dozens of victims. The task force is expanding its investigation into this case, which happened in a northeastern province. The number of teenage victims is expected to reach 200. At the same time, in another northeastern province, a similar case is being investigated in which an internet user with the identity of a handsome Thai-Singaporean luk krung seduces women he meets online, claiming to be in love with his victims. The women, some in their 30s, agreed to prove their real love even if it meant they had to have sex with a stranger as requested by the handsome man online. ""Internet crimes against children are modern crimes happening in a complex environment while the crime scenes are also 'in the cloud'. In this era of the digital economy and digital society, people live in the cloud,"" said TICAC head Tamasak Wicharaya, also an acting deputy commissioner-general of the Royal Thai Police. Each year, about 50,000 downloads and uploads of child pornography are detected in the kingdom by the task force. Such acts are now a crime in Thailand. On Dec 8, 2015, Thailand amended the Criminal Law stipulating penalties for the possession of child pornography as well as transferring or disseminating such material. The penalties include up to five years’ imprisonment and/or a fine of up to 100,000 baht for personal use, and up to seven years’ imprisonment and/or a fine of up to 140,000 baht for commercial use. A month later, TICAC was set up as an ad hoc agency to tackle internet crimes against children, with the support of Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwon in charge of national security and the officers of the Homeland Security Investigations attached to the US embassy in Bangkok. As of June 29, TICAC had received tip-offs and complaints about 129 incidents, with 36 being investigated. Out of these cases, 24 or 67% involve child pornography, eight or 22% involve child sexual abuse and four cases or 11% involve human trafficking. About a quarter of the total cases have been concluded. Among the 35 suspects, 29 were arrested, five foreigners were sent back to their own countries and one is pending charges. RELATED CRIMES Internet crimes against children, besides damaging the victims, are linked to other problems including human trafficking. Child porn images can be used to blackmail and force victims to do things against their will. Meanwhile, such material could lead to other sex crimes such as harassment and rape. Among the cases investigated by TICAC, the youngest victim was four years old. The victim, from an ethnic minority in Chiang Mai's Fang district, was held naked and photographed with the offender, who was also naked. Expert analysts said the pictures could be sexually arousing. If disseminated, they could arouse the viewers to commit sex crimes, Pol Gen Tamasak said. PREDATORS AND PREY TICAC keeps an eye on paedophiles, especially foreigners who have a history of child sexual abuse and those with a history of watching or producing child pornography, Pol Gen Tamasak said. When Thai authorities receive alerts from foreign agencies, such as the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children, the foreigners will be followed more closely. If they are spotted uploading or downloading porn images, police can request a warrant to search their residence and check their mobile phone and computer. If pornographic material is found, they are subject to a criminal lawsuit. ""Some foreigners portray themselves as a saints providing help and giving sweets to children. Once they gain trust of the children, they find a chance to be alone with them and record the victim being abused, then use the media to threaten and further abuse them,"" he added. Meanwhile, TICAC looks after vulnerable children. ""Children from poor families or broken homes are the most vulnerable. Once they fall prey to paedophiles, it is difficult for them to get over the experiences and live in society as normal. They will fall back again as a victim,"" Pol Gen Tamasak said. Poor children looking for work sometimes end up in the sex industry. Afterwards, they became subject of porn media which the offenders use to blackmail and force them to continue working in the industry, which is a recurring pattern in many cases, he added. Children from broken homes who spend a lot of time alone with stepfathers are also at risk. They are usually too frightened to speak out if they are sexually abused, he said. Reports from Khon Kaen and Nakhon Ratchasima revealed that children who have access to the internet are often lured by paedophiles who groom their victims through online communication. PREVENTIVE MEASURES Sex criminals have a higher reoffending rates than other criminals, Eric McLouglin, regional attache of the US Department of Homeland Security, said. Moreover, just as the criminals have networks to share information and adapt rapidly, authorities have to join hands and get ahead of the criminals and implement preventive measures before new crimes happen, he added. TICAC, together with its network including NCMEC, detect and locate uploaders and downloaders of pornographic material before going to search, investigate and take legal action against them before they can commit more crimes. Information from other security agencies also contribute to preventive measures. Last year, after requests to immigration police, 26 Americans were denied entry to Thailand as they had criminal records of child abuse. ""Human trafficking, especially involving children, is the most serious type of crime. The community has a right to know that you are a bad guy. We can locate where you are,"" Pol Gen Tamasak said. ""We are sending a clear message -- Thailand is no longer a safe haven for criminals,"" said the TICAC chief.  

 The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Homeland Security Investigations have organised a training course for police, social workers and non-governmental organisations. (Video by Pornprom Satrabhaya) INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION Among the cases concluded by TICAC, of the 129 incidents, information of 88 incidents, or 68%, came from foreign agencies including law enforcement, embassies and NGOs providing information about offenders, victims and the damaged parties. The FBI and the Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) have vowed to give full support to Thai police to bring wrongdoers to justice if Americans commit crimes in Thailand. Eight Americans have been prosecuted and several have been repatriated to serve penalties in the US. There are factors to consider in deciding whether to send the suspects back to their own country or to have them prosecuted in Thailand. Chief among these is the chance of a successful prosecution, said John Schachnovsky, FBI legal attache at the US embassy in Bangkok. Fighting such crimes needs collaboration from law enforcement officials, social workers and NGOs as well as the private sector, including telecommunication service providers. The special teams include victim analysts and digital forensic analysts. THE ROLE OF NGOs Many times, NGOs are the first to respond to victims. Mr Schachnovsky, who has been in Thailand for seven years, said many years ago NGOs and the police did not want to work with each other. ""Their attitude was 'we don't need them',"" said the FBI officer referring to the situation in the past. However, they later realised that they needed each other to successfully put the wrongdoers behind bars and protect innocent people. More NGOs are happy to join forces with the law enforcement team. Wirawan ""Boom"" Mosby, the 2017 recipient of the US Secretary of State Trafficking in Persons Report Hero Award, is also an active member of TICAC. The director of the Hope, Understanding and Grace (HUG) project in Chiang Mai has been providing investigative support through fact finding, case coordination and consultations with various law enforcement, social work, NGO and government officials. She also conducts key forensic interviews with child victims of trafficking and sexual abuse. She also spearheaded the opening of ACT (Advocacy Center For Children Thailand) House, the first such centre in Southeast Asia, which also has branches in Pattaya and Phuket. ""To make further progress, we need to educate and train people how to properly address these issues,"" Ms Mosby said in an interview with the Bangkok Post. ""Preconceived ideas and misconceptions have to be replaced with the right type of knowledge so that victims will be encouraged to seek help. They have to be told they are not at fault. We need more people with a heart for victims of sexual and domestic violence. It is pivotal to not prejudge their actions."" SPECIAL TRAINING Information from the victims is the key to success in an investigation, finding the wrongdoers and the prosecution. However, to get such information from victims and witnesses who have been through an ordeal is not easy, and sensitivity must be kept in mind. ""We want the entire story to come from the victim, not from us. Even if we go into the interview knowing a lot of factual information because evidence has been gathered, we still need all that information to come from the victim. And sometimes with younger children, it's a very difficult task to ask them to do that. So we need to make sure that we ask appropriate questions that a child can understand and can relate to and respond,"" said Crystal Gregory, forensic interview specialist and national programme manager at HSI. In the case of forced labour in the fisheries industry, police investigation stalled. Despite the evidence and witnesses' accounts, the police failed to get the victims' accounts. A key Cambodian victim lost his memory and refused to say anything as a result of being tortured on a boat. It took the police and related experts two years of patience and skills to help the victim regain his memory, and then he finally gave information that led to a successful prosecution, Pol Gen Tamasak said. From July 10-14, the FBI and the HSI as well as the US embassy organised a special training course on forensic interviewing of child and adolescent victims and witnesses for Thai police, social workers and NGOs including HUG from Chiang Mai, A21 from Pattaya and For Freedom International from Phuket. The course was on different skills and techniques to talk to victims of crimes such as trafficking in persons, child exploitation and forced child labour to ensure that the victims can feel safe and provide a safe environment to talk about the abuse they encountered, said Ms Gregory, one of the trainers. It also discussed victimisation, the effects of trauma and how a victim can face different problems throughout the process. The training also included steps to provide a safe environment in a neutral location, and to make sure that during the interview, the interviewers are not blaming the victims, Ms Gregory added. It was the same 40-hour basic training provided to the American investigation teams. The failure to properly interview victims will not only jeopardise the legal case but can also ruin the lives of the victims, especially when they are children, said the Department of Homeland Security's Mr McLouglin. Interviewing the victims of human trafficking and other forms of exploitation must be based on the principle of a victim-centric approach, he added. ""The interviewers need the skills and interview techniques to make sure that the victims are not re-victimised, and they must be interviewed in a safe place. Otherwise, they might see investigators as bad people and will not open up,"" Mr McLouglin said. Mr Schachnovsky said the interview must be in a friendly environment, not where uniformed police are walking around. Children's advocacy centres, currently available in Chiang Mai, Pattaya and Phuket, are examples of a suitable interview environment. The interviewer and the victim have a one-to-one interview in a room, which other investigators can watch from another room via video. ""We must keep in mind that the victims must be able to go back into society. Every part of the investigation is very important. If it fails, it will hurt the victims for their whole life,"" Mr Schachnovsky said. The group hopes to set the victim-centric approach as the standard for interviews. BUILDING TRUST, EXPANDING FORCES While Mr Schachnovsky praised the efficiency and effectiveness that TICAC has shown through its success in less than two years, Pol Gen Tamasak pointed out that it was a small team of committed people who understand each other. Meanwhile, it has gained understanding and assistance from police from different departments.

											Paedophile faces new charges										",https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/402373/swirly-face-predator-charged-again,"VANCOUVER - A former Canadian schoolteacher who spent five years in a Thai prison for sexually abusing children after an image of his digitally obscured face was reconstructed is facing 10 new charges, Canadian police say. This series of photos shows the original swirled photo Neil posted of himself, and the work Interpol did to ""un-swirl"" it. He was spotted by a hotel's CCTV checking in for a Pattaya stay, where he was arrested. In custody and in prison in Thailand, he was almost always shown smiling. (Photo by Interpol, Bangkok Post.) The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said Christopher Paul Neil was arrested for sexual touching and child pornography production, which police say occurred in 2003 in Cambodia, and possession of child pornography in 2007 in Canada. He also faces additional counts of accessing child pornography.     Neil became known notoriously as the ""swirly face"" paedophile because of the way he had altered his image online. The Canadian taught in several Asian countries before being first arrested in northeastern Thailand in October 2007 following an international manhunt after hundreds of photos of him allegedly engaging in sex acts with young boys were discovered on the Internet. Neil was arrested in Thailand after Interpol unscrambled swirled digital images from about 200 internet photos, which showed Neil engaging in sexual acts with boys.      He released from prison in Thailand and returned to Canada in 2012 under strict conditions meant to protect children, but he pleaded guilty to breaching a condition last year after police found him with a laptop in breach of his conditions.     Police said the latest apprehension was the result of investigations by both RCMP Integrated Child Exploitation and Vancouver city police. In September 2012, Thai officials in Thailand confirmed that evidence provided by Canadian police in their case had not been used in their prosecution. Canadian investigators working with prosecutors reviewed their findings and conducted follow up investigations. "
