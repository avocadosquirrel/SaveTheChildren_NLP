9.1.2020,Appeal court upholds guilty verdict in Oulu child sex abuse case,https://yle.fi/uutiset/11150396,"The Rovaniemi Court of Appeal has upheld the conviction by Oulu District Court of a 30-year-old man for the sexual abuse of a 13-year-old girl. The court sentenced the defendant, Javad Mirzad, to three years and four months in prison after he was found guilty of aggravated child sexual abuse by the district court last summer.  The appeal court confirmed the man's guilty verdict on the charges brought against him. However, the court halved the amount of damages the defendant was ordered to pay the victim - down a total of 1,500 euros. The appeal hearing was linked to a series of similar cases in which a 13-year-old girl was believed to have suffered abuse at the hands of eight foreign-background men between June and October of 2018. The court found that the offences involving the defendant occurred at a private residence in the Oulu region August 2018 and that the victim and the defendant had been in contact via a messaging service. All of the defendants involved had arrived in the country as asylum seekers or quota refugees. Thursday's appeal hearing was the second case in which the district court decision was upheld. In December the appellate court upheld a three-year sentence imposed on Osman Humad last summer. "

7.6.2019,Court hands down 40-month prison sentence in 4th Oulu child sex abuse case,https://yle.fi/uutiset/10820884,"The Oulu district court has convicted a 29-year-old man for the sexual abuse of a minor, who was 13 years-old at the time the offences were committed. The court sentenced the defendant, Javad Mirzad, to three years and four months in prison after he was found guilty of aggravated child sexual abuse. The court found that the offences occurred at a private residence in the Oulu region last August and that the victim and the defendant had been in contact via a messaging service. The conviction is the fourth in a series of similar cases in which the same 13-year-old girl is believed to have suffered abuse at the hands of of eight different foreign-background men between June and October last year. On Wednesday, another defendant -- a 22-year-old man -- received a three-year sentence after conviction on similar charges. Oulu district prosecutor Kaisa Kytömäki said that she hadn’t fully reviewed the court’s arguments for the sentence, but remarked that it was in line with previous sentencing handed down in the series of related cases, adding that it aligned well with the prosecutor’s demands. ""The sentence appears to be well-reasoned,"" she continued. Defence attorney Heikki Aspegren said that he had not yet spoken with his client, but told Yle that he believed that they would appeal the sentence. ""There is justification for an appeal. The prison sentence seems rather long. I believe that the sentence has been a disappointment for my client,"" Aspegren added. Tabloid daily Iltalehti reported on Friday that the defendant denied the charges against him and told the court that he believed the girl was 16. In Finland, the legally-defined age of consent is 16. Edit 7.6.2019 The original headline erroneously stated that the sentence was 30 months."

20.9.2019,Ex-church councillor among four charged in violent child sex abuse ring,https://yle.fi/uutiset/10981177,"Authorities in Ostrobothnia, western Finland have charged four persons suspected of involvement in a large-scale cross-border child sex abuse case that involved violence and the rape of minors. The suspected crimes were committed between 2007 and 2014 while other offences relating to pornographic images involving children dated from 2007 to 2017. Investigators had originally zeroed in on six suspects during their probe, but charges were eventually laid against four of the men. The main suspect in the case has been charged with possession and aggravated dissemination of indecent images of children, aggravated child sex abuse, child sex abuse and aggravated rape. Another suspect has been charged with aggravated child sex abuse and aggravated rape as well as possession of and aggravated dissemination of indecent images of children. A third was charged with aggravated child sexual abuse. Authorities charged a fourth suspect with charges of possession of indecent images of children as well as other offences. One of the defendants is likely to be fined for the charges levied, while officials have decided not to prosecute another. The defendants have largely denied the charges against them or have not commented on them. In March, police described the central feature of the investigation as involving ""child harm and violence against children."" ""In its mildest form the abuse that occurred in Finland involved showing adult pornography to children. In the worst cases, children were drugged and raped for 10 hours,"" lead investigator Sanna Springare said at the time. District prosecutor Jaana Nyrhinen did not divulge additional details about the charges laid. While she admitted that some children had been drugged, she declined to identify the narcotics used. The National Bureau of Investigation NBI said that the international investigation has been expansive. ""There are more than 400 hours of abuse material. The majority of these acts target foreign individuals whose identities could not be determined,"" Nyrhinen noted. However investigators said that they have been able to identify victims in Finland. Police reported earlier that their ages ranged from six to 15 years old. The prosecutor has a requested closed-door hearings as well as officially sealing the court documents as well as the verdicts. He said that the trial would likely begin next year. Police first revealed that they were investigating the large-scale case back in March. Some of the suspects under police scrutiny were suspected of disseminating child pornography, some of which involved physical abuse and rape of child victims. According to information obtained by Yle, the main suspect has worked as a church councillor and entrepreneur and reportedly had an unblemished reputation before the suspected crimes were publicised. The preliminary investigation revealed six victims, ranging in age from pre-schoolers to upper comprehensive school children. "
29.3.2019,"Friday's papers: Politicians' plans to check meat consumption, child sex abuse suspects, MP threatened",https://yle.fi/uutiset/10712589,"The country's most widely-read daily Helsingin Sanomat looks at recent campaign talk from some political parties about reducing the consumption of meat in Finland, due to its impact on health and the environment.  Some of the parties suggest raising taxes on meat or reducing taxes on vegetables, to encourage people to eat better. Others propose changing agricultural subsidies to better reflect environment and climate considerations. HS says the parties are on to something, as diet accounts for 15 percent of household CO2 emissions, with meat and dairy products playing an outsize role, comparatively. Food production is also responsible for 60 percent of nutrients that cause eutrophication in the Baltic Sea. The Social Democratic Party, for example, seeks to lower the value added tax on ""products without high emissions"" from its current 14 percent rate. In addition to problems with EU tax policy compliance, HS says this kind of tax policy to affect consumption has not always had the desired effect. A recent sugar tax, for example, did not reduce sweets consumption, although it did steer people away from sugary drinks.  Other parties like the National Coalition Party say the answer is to change agricultural subsidies in Finland to encourage more planet-friendly products. For example, vegetable and insect proteins should be supported so there is a ""fair playing field"" in comparison to meat and dairy products. A representative of the MTK farming lobby tells the paper that Finland's hands are tied in this area, too, due to EU membership and international agreements. He says the biggest reason more Finns don't eat recommended amounts of vegetable products is simply because they prefer meat. If meat were to become more expensive, he says, they would just look for cheaper, imported meat instead. The Oulu-based newspaper Kaleva carries a story on the suspects in an extensive child sexual abuse network uncovered by police. The victims of the suspected violent sexual abuse, which was believed to have taken place from 2014 to 2018, were six young boys.  The paper says that the five Finnish men who are suspects in the case are from different parts of Finland. The main suspect is a 57-year-old tour operator from Lapland whose company organised events like canoe trips and dog sledding in northern Finland. Kaleva says the main suspect had also worked for the Finnish Evangelical Church nearly a decade ago, as a youth program assistant at a parish in Southern Ostrobothnia. He was also elected to the church council there, where he served for about two years. The paper reports that the other suspects in the case are a 43-year-old man from Vaasa, a 51-year-old man from Helsinki, and a 22-year-old man from Southern Ostrobothnia. The fifth suspect is unknown, the paper writes. Three of the suspects were convicted last August in the Helsinki District Court for their part in a methamphetamine ring. The suspect from Helsinki was sentenced to four-year suspended sentence for selling the drugs, which he brought into the country from Thailand and the Netherlands.  The tabloid Iltalehti features a story on  threats of violence against Finns Party MP Laura Huhtasaari and her family on Thursday. The person behind the threats has been identified as Tero Niskanen, a municipal politician from the western city of Pori who represents the National Coalition Party. Niskanen has since submitted his resignation to the party and publicly apologised to Huhtasaari and her family. He wrote on Facebook that he was ""very emotional"" when he made a threatening call to the emergency services number. The call was traced and Niskanen was taken into custody. The police are investigating the incident. "
8.1.2020,Helsinki teacher appeals suspended sentence for child sexual abuse ,https://yle.fi/uutiset/11147629,"A male teacher at a Helsinki school has appealed an 18-month suspended prison sentence after being found guilty of sexually abusing students in his charge. The appeal trial began in the Court of Appeal on Wednesday. In December 2018, the 44-year-old mathematics teacher at a Swedish-language school in Helsinki was convicted and sentenced for the sexual abuse of nine children between 2013 and 2017. The court ruled that the teacher had sent messages with sexual images and texts to young boys and engaged in inappropriate physical contact with them. The accused however denied having sexual intercourse with one of the students and claimed that the physical contact and massages were not sexual in nature. The alleged abuser also denied sending pictures of his genitalia to a 15-year-old and claimed he was not aware that the student he was communicating with was under the age of 16. The court revealed that the teacher had received a written warning in 2014 for his improper conduct, however he continued to engage in inappropriate interaction with the students. The teacher's ongoing improper conduct came to the school's attention in autumn 2016, and the institution filed a criminal complaint in early 2017. The accused admitted to the district court that the descriptions of his behaviour were partially correct but argued that his actions did not meet the criteria for child sexual abuse. Finland’s criminal code defines a child sexual abuser as someone who has interaction such as touching or engages in other sexual actions with a child under the age of 16. The acts must be damaging to the child’s development. A suspect may also be found guilty of the offence for causing a child to commit such acts. The former headmaster of the school was also fined in February 2019 for not lawfully reporting the matter to the police, even though he was aware of the alleged sexual abuse. The verdict is not final yet and the court will hear the case against the principal early this year."
24.1.2019,Pori man gets 16 months jail time for child sexual abuse,https://yle.fi/uutiset/10612058,"The Satakunta district court has sentenced a Pori man to a 16-month prison sentence following his conviction for sexual abuse of two children, as well as attempted sexual abuse, alcohol offences and illegal sales of cigarettes. The ruling also relates to a suspended prison sentence the man received for sexual abuse of a minor and alcohol offences two years ago. The 68-year-old had sold and provided cigarettes and alcohol to underaged children and lured them to his home. The youngest of his victims was 10 years old. The man denied committing the sex crimes but the court found him guilty. However a separate charge of assault was dismissed. The prosecution justified the assault charge by arguing that the boys allegedly became inebriated from the alcohol they drank. The court ruled that it was not possible to determine the degree of inebriation and the possible impact on their health. The court ordered part of the sentence to be sealed. "
26.3.2019,Man receives 2.5-year jail sentence in second Oulu child sex abuse case,https://yle.fi/uutiset/10708169,"Oulu District Court sentenced 22-year-old Abdullhadi Barhum to two-and-a-half years in prison after convicting him of rape and aggravated sexual exploitation of a 14-year-old girl. Barhum and his underage victim did not know each other before the offences took place last autumn in Oulu, on Finland's west coast. According to court testimony, the victim had asked for someone on the social media app Snapchat to bring her cigarettes and that Barhum responded to her request. According to testimony, Barhum later provided the girl with alcohol and had been aware the girl was 14-years-old. He met his victim two times in Oulu's Tuira neighbourhood and the rape took place outdoors during their second meeting last November. That same weekend another suspected child sex abuse case came to the attention of authorities, but the incidents were not related and the suspects did not know each other, according to police. Last week a 44-year-old man was sentenced to a three-year eight-month prison term after being found guilty of the aggravated child sexual abuse and aggravated rape of a 10-year-old girl. Those offences were found to have occurred between summer and autumn last year.  Tuesday's verdict was the second of several cases of suspected child sex abuse under investigation in Oulu that came to light late last year. In some of those suspected cases the perpetrators had known their victims in advance of the alleged offences, while in other cases contact had been established via the internet and social media. According to investigators the suspects in those cases include Finnish nationals as well as foreigners."
5.6.2019,Three year prison sentence in third of Oulu child sex abuse cases,https://yle.fi/uutiset/10817567,"Oulu District Court sentenced a man on Wednesday to three years in prison for charges of aggravated sexual abuse of a child and luring a child for sexual purposes. The defendant, Osman Humad, was 22 to 23-years-old at the time of the crimes, which took place on a number of occasions between June to October 2018, while the female victim was 13. The perpetrator first made contact with the girl via Facebook, after which the two communicated on messaging apps Messenger and Snapchat. The court said it considered the abuse charge to be aggravated because of the major age difference between the defendant and the victim. Humad denied throughout his case that he had committed a crime. Wednesday's verdict and sentencing marked the third of several cases of suspected child sex abuse in Oulu, in which eight men ""of foreign background"" stand - or stood - accused. Two of those defendants have already been convicted and sentenced. Special prosecutor Pia Mäenpää said she was satisfied with Wednesday's sentencing, saying that the court met the demands of the prosecution.

12.2.2019,Two new suspected cases of child sexual abuse in Oulu,https://yle.fi/uutiset/10642570,"Police in Oulu said on Monday that they are investigating two cases of alleged child sexual abuse suspected to have occurred last weekend.  The suspected cases were first reported by the Oulu regional paper Kaleva and lead investigator Detective Chief Inspector Eveliina Karjalainen confirmed to Yle that an investigation had been launched into the alleged offences.

They declined to comment on whether other suspects are involved. Oulu police have been investigating several reported cases of child sex abuse since last November. "
19.9.2017,"Third suspect in child sexual abuse case held in Germany, remanded in custody",https://yle.fi/uutiset/9840486,"A judge in North Karelia remanded an Iraqi-background man into custody on Monday on suspicion of sexual abuse of a minor. The man managed to leave Finland before being brought to trial.  However he was located in Germany in June and sent back to Finland to face trial. He is suspected of committing a sex crime with a girl under the age of 16. The incident is believed to have taken place in a private home last December, where a group of young girls and the three Iraqi-background men were spending the night. The North Karelia District Court previously handed one of the men a 13-month suspended prison sentence for attempted rape and child sexual abuse. The sentence remains in force in the Eastern Finland Appeal Court, since the man withdrew his appeal. A third man received an 18-month prison sentence for aggravated child sexual abuse.

The man was arrested in the city of Saarbrücken in western Germany on Wednesday evening.  The suspect, who is one of eight men being investigated for sexual offences against minors, will likely be extradited to Finland by the end of January, police said.

9.5.2019,4-year prison sentence in Oulu child sexual abuse case,https://yle.fi/uutiset/10775828,"Oulu District Court has sentenced a man to four years in prison for the aggravated rape and aggravated sexual abuse of a child. He was also ordered to pay the victim 22,000 euros for pain, suffering and undermining her psychological situation. The female victim was 13 years old at the time of the crimes. They took place between April and September of last year in a private residence in the northern city of Oulu. The court says that there were ""shortcomings in the victim's ability to act and understand"", which the perpetrator should have realised. The perpetrator and the victim had met and kept in contact via Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. According to the Finnish News Agency STT, the perpetrator is a 21-year-old who came from Afghanistan as an asylum seeker. Special prosecutor Pia Mäenpää said she is satisfied with the court's decision, while council for the defence, Jaana Piipar said both she and her client were disappointed with it, saying they plan to initiate appeal proceedings.  The case is one of a series of crimes that came to light in Oulu at the end of last year.

20.3.2019,Court hands down 44-month jail term in Oulu child sex abuse case,https://yle.fi/uutiset/10698801,"A 44-year-old man has been slapped with a three-year eight-month prison sentence after being found guilty of aggravated child sexual abuse and aggravated rape. The offences were found to have occurred between summer and autumn last year. On Wednesday the Oulu District Court convicted the defendant, Muso Asoev, and said that it based its ruling and sentencing on the trust that the victim -- a 10-year-old child -- had placed in the accused. The court also ordered Asoev to pay the victim 9,500 euros for distress arising from the offence and an additional 1,500 euros for pain, suffering and other afflictions. The court said that the trust the child placed in the accused played a role in its sentencing. The man had no previous criminal record. Wednesday's verdict is the first of several cases of suspected child sex abuse under investigation in Oulu that came to light late last year. At the time police said they suspected eight men of child sex abuse committed over a period of several months.

9.7.2019,Four and a half year prison sentence in 6th Oulu child sex abuse case ,https://yle.fi/uutiset/10869460,"The Oulu District Court sentenced Hassan Mohamed Mohamud to four and a half years in prison on the charges of aggravated child sexual abuse and aggravated rape. The offences were committed on three separate occasions between July and October last year at two different hotels in Oulu.  As in the previous cases, the court found that the crime was further aggravated by the age difference between the defendant and the victim, and that the defendant had taken advantage of the girl's interest in him. The court also ruled that the defendant should have been aware of the victim's limited decision-making ability, which was a sign of the victim's young age and vulnerability.  The defendant and the victim had initially met online and kept in contact through the Kik messaging application. Tuesday’s conviction and sentencing is the sixth in a series of similar cases in which the same 13-year-old girl is believed to have suffered abuse at the hands of eight men of foreign background last summer and autumn. Two additional cases are still to be tried in court. District prosecutor Pia Mäenpää previously told Yle that there is no evidence to suggest that the suspects - all of whom did not know each other - abused the victim at the same time and or in the same place. Yle has learned that at least three of the men lived at the same reception centre.  Police say all the suspects came to Finland as refugees or asylum seekers, and that some of the eight have already been granted refugee status or Finnish citizenship.  The case was heard by two district judges and two jurors, and the court's judgment was unanimous. "
18.1.2019,All Points North #36: Media coverage of child sex abuse allegations with Anu Koivunen and Sam Kingsley,https://yle.fi/uutiset/10602756,"This week APN examined how the media has handled reports of recent alleged sex abuse crimes that police suspect were carried out by immigrants. The topic has raised the public's worry and outrage and grabbed the attention of lawmakers who quickly decided to increase the legal penalties for sex offences. As of Friday's programme, none of the suspects had been charged. Along with special guests media researcher Anu Koivunen and journalist Sam Kingsley, APN examined how the Finnish media has handled the ongoing sensitive subject so far. Due to Finland's laws on personal privacy, the topic of sexual abuse crimes - particularly when children are the victims - is not one that generally receives a lot of attention in the media because police don't often publicly announce preliminary investigations in such cases. When cases like these do reach the courts, they're heard behind closed doors.  But this time, the Finnish media provided a steady drumbeat of reportage on suspected offences in Oulu and Helsinki, as the police mentioned that the alleged perpetrators had foreign backgrounds.  Journalist Kingsley said that the media has a lot of power, and so it should carefully consider the ramifications of its coverage. He noted that his own employer, AFP news agency had to consider whether the Oulu case crossed the international news threshold. But once the Finnish President weighed in on the issue and Parliament began to consider tighter legislation, there was consensus that a story was warranted. Media researcher Koivunen added that since 2015, the media has also been more sensitive to social media trends, feeling compelled to report on subjects that have animated the public. She regretted that coverage of the alleged child sex abuse cases in Finland - which police say are not related - is now being rolled into Finland's stance on UN humans rights conventions and the larger immigration debate. Finland decided on Friday to review international conventions to which it is a signatory with a view to better manage immigration policy.  Audience favourites on Yle News social media sites this week included news of the bronze medal claimed by Finland's junior women's ice hockey team in Japan. The young Finnish team's impressive run for the championship title ran into a wall when they were defeated 7-1 by the US in the semi-finals.  Another news story that attracted interest was a report on unknown assailants firing three shots through a Finnish-Iraqi couple's front door in the municipality of Kangasala, near Tampere, narrowly missing the head of the female occupant of the home. The Finnish woman speculated that the act was racially-motivated and influenced by the alleged child sex abuse reports from Oulu and Helsinki. And finally, a story on a snow church in Lappeenranta, southeast Finland. The town's vicar said visitors can attend services there three times a week - and even exchange wedding vows if they wish. But brides- and grooms-to-be better be quick about it, as the frosty chapel will probably melt by March.

Kids in danger are frequently victims of abuse or neglect. According to the book, tens of thousands of minors are treated poorly at home. Last year more than 60,000 of them had to be placed in group homes or with foster families. The most frequent form of ill treatment is neglect. This includes not meeting children?s needs when it comes to food, love or acceptance, according to some of the experts that wrote the book. The newest and most worrying form of abuse is the use of children?s pictures on paedophile websites."

The court ordered him to pay thousands of euros in damages to his victims. The case is linked to a broader sex crime investigation in which three middle-aged men from the capital city area stand charged of sexually abusing dozens of children. In some of the cases the suspects and victims met over the Internet. Other cases involved physical contact between the perpetrators and children. One of the men was sentenced to a 20-month prison sentence by the Helsinki District Court last month. The court will hand down a ruling on the third suspect next week.
23.6.2020,"Online child groomer gets two-year suspended sentence, paper reports",https://yle.fi/uutiset/11414153,"Central Finland District Court has handed a two-year suspended prison sentence to a Jyväskylä man found guilty of grooming and sexually exploiting 22 children over the course of two years, according to the newspaper Keskisuomalainen.  The defendant was also ordered to pay damages to his victims totalling 29,500 euros, cover all legal costs totalling 14,500 euros, and perform 120 hours of community service.  The paper reported that the 41-year-old man was convicted on 13 charges of sexually abusing children, 10 charges of attempting to lure a child into sexual activity, two of disseminating a sexually abusive image and two of possessing an image of a sexually abused child. The man had previously denied committing nearly all of the crimes during the preliminary investigation, but later admitted to them in court. The paper added that the court had considered a custodial sentence in the case, but opted for a suspended sentence instead as the defendant had already spent four months in pretrial detention and did not have a previous criminal record.  The court also took into account that no physical contact was involved in any of the crimes. The man committed the crimes between 2018 and 2020 by pretending to be a child using the Momio social media platform, which is popular among 7 to 13-year-old children.  A police investigation was launched on the basis of tip-offs from the site’s administrators, and the man was eventually caught in a covert operation conducted by the National Bureau of Investigation.  Undercover police established conversations with the man and he was arrested in October after he turned up to a pre-arranged meeting with what he believed was a child. He was then held in pre-trial detention until mid-December.

This also affects rape and sexual coercion committed against youth under 18 years of age. Until now, the statute of limitations on the sexual abuse of children has expired after ten years, and aggravated sexual assault expired after 20. The new law also changes punishments for abducting children to anywhere between a fine and two years in prison. However, the new rules will only affect crimes committed after the law comes into effect. This year, sex-related crimes have grown significantly in the capital region, with crimes against children having increased the most. Police say the increase is due in part to more victims coming forward to report the crimes."
25.4.2005,Man Suspected of Sexually Abusing 445 Boys,http://yle.fi/uutiset/5215933,"The 43-year-old man will be tried soon in a court in Kouvola. If he's found guilty, this will be the largest crime in Finnish history in terms of the number of victims. He could face up to 10 years in prison. The man was arrested in January as he returned from his 26th trip to Thailand. Police suspect him of abusing local boys aged 12 and 13. 
Diary Detailed Abuse
 Police seized a large amount of child pornography that they say the man had produced in Thailand. In a raid on his house, they also found a diary which they say is hard evidence against him. ""In the search we found his diary, in which there were precise details about his previous trips,"" says Chief Inspector Lars Henriksson of the Central Criminal Police. Police got the tip from abroad, where a similar investigation into a foreign paedophile revealed a link to the Finnish man. Nonetheless, authorities don't believe the Finn is part of a paedophile network. They describe him as a ""lone wolf"". Police won't say whether the suspect has confessed, but they believe the evidence against him is incontrovertible."
3.1.2008,Paedophile Rehabilitation Useless?,http://yle.fi/uutiset/5817707,"
Currently used methods to treat paedophiles are largely useless, reports YLE's investigative journalism programme Silminnäkijä. Treatment must be voluntary, and few convicted child molesters chose this option.
 ""In the past ten years, dozens of people have been sentenced to jail [for child molestation]. And yet only three have voluntarily sought treatment. That's only around one percent of convicted paedophiles,"" Dr. Hannu Lauerma, the chief physician for Turku's prison hospital told Silminnäkijä. Lauerma also says that psychotherapy is ineffective as well, and the number of repeat offenders is very large. The most effective method, according to Lauerma, is the use of new kinds of hormones that directly affect the brain. But these can only be given with the convict's consent. According to police statistics, the number of child molestation cases in the past decade has doubled. Much of this is certainly due to increased awareness of the crime, but a large part of the increase is also due to the possibilities offered to paedophiles by the Internet."

The officer in charge of the investigation, Inspector Sampo Suomala, said there were sufficient reasons to proceed with the investigation. The artist, Ulla Karttunen, is suspected of possessing obscene photos of children. The prosecutor will decide whether to press charges following the preliminary investigation. Police confiscated the artwork Friday from the Kluuvi Gallery in Helsinki after a visitor at the exhibition called police to complain. According to Karttunen, the work criticises child pornography and is comprised of pictures found on the internet. The artist said she is surprised by the police action.

14.1.2009,Plan to Forcibly Medicate Paedophiles in the Works,http://yle.fi/uutiset/5713460,"Currently it is illegal to require individuals to take medication in Finland. The number of persons accused of paedophilia has more than doubled since the turn of the century. Many of the culprits are repeat offenders. Last year, the Justice Ministry established a working group to determine if perpetrators could be forcibly medicated. According to information obtained by YLE, the group feels that persons guilty of aggravated paedophilia could be prescribed such treatment. The drugs are already in use in Denmark and Sweden. “The drugs interact with hormonal systems and suppress sex drive. This is an extreme solution and should only be used as a last resort,” said Hannu Lauerma, the chief physician at the Psychiatric Hospital for Prisoners. The working group has challenges ahead if it wants to see this legislation passed. Under Finland's current law, individuals cannot be medicated against their will. Furthermore, there is the question of how to monitor the use of the medication. The working group is also considering whether failure to take the drugs could be grounds for shipping convicts back to jail."

Background checks are however not required of people working under contracts lasting less than three months. Substitute teachers also tend to slip through laws that were designed to protect children. Employers are moreover not informed of any convictions handed down to their employees. Pecuniary penalties are not listed on criminal records. This means that someone convicted of sexual abuse has an unrestricted opportunity to work with children. Furthermore, suspended prison sentences are not a deterrent from working with children, as sentences are wiped off criminal records after five years, reports Turun Sanomat."

The perpetrators are suspected of hundreds of sexual offences, including aggravated sexual abuse of minors and coercion. The victims are between the ages of 6 and 17 years old and come from different areas in Finland. Police say they are not sure at this stage if the incidents are part of a larger paedophile ring. Some of the cases have already progressed to court while charges are still pending in other instances. The victims and the suspected perpetrators met online in IRC and other chatrooms. Police began their investigations at the beginning of this year. They are continuing to investigate the matter.

She said her intent was to condemn child pornography and the industry which has sprung up around the sexualisation of teenage girls. A visitor to the gallery made an official complaint to police about the piece. Police then confiscated both the offending art and Karttunen's computer. Karttunen was found guilty, but was not punished. A lower court ruled that the closure of the exhibit and the confiscations were punishment enough. Karttunen, displeased with the verdict, applied for the right to appeal to the Supreme Court."
8.9.2005,Chat Rooms Used by Paedophile Recruiters,http://yle.fi/uutiset/5218797,"Most Internet chat room are anonymous, where the users are untraceable. Child welfare advocates fear that paedophile businesses are using this advantage to lure young girls into the sex trade with promises of easy money. Even though authorities suspect that most of the offers come from abroad, they often pop up in Finnish, targeting Finnish teenagers. For example, one link posted in a chat room takes users to a Finnish-language web page which tells girls they can make money by sending in their used underwear, adding that they get more money if they send a picture of them wearing the undergarments. The offer ends with a postscript assuring girls that they shouldn't tell their parents, and that this is all strictly legal. 
Legal Difficulties
 The truth is that the legality of this type of activity is a grey area. The National Bureau of Investigation says that it?s unclear what kind of action can be taken against recruiters operating abroad. They are also concerned that soliciting girls? underwear is an entry point for many to be recruited into other aspects of the sex trade. Chat room monitors say that weeding out predators is a nearly impossible task - even with mandatory registration, anyone can lie on the Internet."

Around one in three underage prostitutes are boys, but as far as police know, all of the customers have been men. The crime is difficult to track, as both buyer and seller are keen to keep the transaction secret. While prostitution is legal in Finland, buying sex from minors is not. Prevention or investigation of child prostitution is extremely difficult, as the deals are usually struck over the Internet, or in places where teens hang out."
5.10.2004,Child Porn Hotline Busy,http://yle.fi/uutiset/5193052,"The Internet is vast and contains hidden, shady networks. In this murky cyberspace, paedophiles exchange child pornography, as well as buy and sell it. Sometimes the material is openly flaunted, at other times it can be deposited in well-hidden digital libraries. Paedophiles have known that the risk of getting caught is minimal. Save the Children Finland set up a hotline to detect child pornography on the Internet two years ago. The child protection association has been surprised by the number of reports it has received so far. It has also noticed that reports have increased with the spread of high-speed broadband Internet connections. The society says that many of the people who have contacted them have been shocked when confronted with so-called Lolita pages. Catching the people who post child porn on the Internet is not easy - especially, as the trail often leads abroad and outside the EU. However, Save the Children Finland believes that knowledge is power. The more information it gathers about child porn on the web, the more it can help the authorities catch the paedophiles. The child protection society says that child porn is like organised rape of children, which continues as long as there is demand, and as long as others close their eyes to the problem.

Child welfare advocates have come to the defence of a law giving police the right to recommend the censorship of websites.
 Finland's Ombudsman for Children Maria Kaisa Aula and the director for Finland's branch of Save the Children, Hanna Markkula-Kivisilta, say the law does not go far enough to prevent the spread of child pornography on the Internet. On Tuesday, demonstrators gathered in Helsinki to protest the law, which they say gives police unconstitutional powers and does little to stop the spread of child porn. But Aula and Markkula-Kivisilta say that censorship and other preventative measures must be expanded. They feel that if the current system of asking service providers to voluntarily filter websites doesn't work, then the government should start making it mandatory. Currently, the National Bureau of Investigation compiles a list of suspect websites and recommends that Internet service providers voluntarily block access to them. The law aims to prevent people from accessing child porn sites that are maintained abroad - domestic sites are already banned by Finnish criminal law."

The majority of the tips direct investigators abroad. While almost all tips concerning Finns have been resolved, catching criminals abroad is more difficult. Faltering international collaboration means that the majority of those posting internet child pornography sites abroad never get caught. Most of the tips originate from an internet tip line run by the Save the Children organisation. The organisation passes on the tips to local officials if it can determine where the site is based. Otherwise the tip gets sent to the National Bureau of Investigation. Most of the tips direct investigators to sites based in Russia, the Ukraine and Belarus. Detective Sergeant Jukka Mäkynen of the IT-Crime Squad at the National Bureau of Investigation says it is difficult to get in contact with officials in these countries. The situation is further complicated because internet crimes have lower priority compared to other crimes in the Ukraine and Belarus. According to Minister of Transport and Communications Susanna Huovinen, Finnish operators will begin using software to prohibit access to foreign child porn sites this spring. The programs prohibit the average internet user from accessing child porn sites by accident. However, not all transmissions can be blocked. Owning and sharing child porn is a crime in Finland.

""We go through each website that we're presented with, and if it contains illegal material then it ends up on the blacklist."" Once a webpage is blacklisted, those trying to reach the site are directed to a police filter site instead of the one they were aiming for. The project hinges on the voluntary participation of network providers, who agree to put the filters in place. Network provider Sonera, for example, plans to join the effort in March. 
Free Speech Advocates Cry Foul
 This is the first time that movement on the internet is being restricted in Finland. It's sparked an outcry from free speech advocates, who say the blacklist is ineffective and even blocks access to perfectly innocent sites. ""Most child porn circulates on secret networks that don't show up the list at all,"" says the chairman of the civil rights organisation Electric Frontier Finland, Tapani Tarvainen. ""The filter has blocked a search engine, a Japanese doll shop, a Thai chat room, and other perfectly innocent sites."" But police say that's just not possible. They argue that they review all the websites, and only block criminal material. According to police, the censorship list is necessary, because pornographic photos circulating on the net can cause never-ending trauma for victims.

The more serious charge of the distribution of child pornography stems from a brochure for an exhibition of Karttunen's art which contained a photograph of the art work which included pornographic images of children. The case will be heard by a court sometime this spring. In a work entitled ""Neitsythuorakirkko"" (Viginwhorechurch) exhibited at Helsinki's Kluuvi gallery, Karttunen used child pornography materials downloaded from the Internet.

3.5.2018,Supreme Court denies appeal in sexual abuse of 10-year-old,https://yle.fi/uutiset/10188676,"The Supreme Court has rejected the prosecution’s request to appeal a three-year prison sentence handed down by a Pirkanmaa court for sexual crimes committed against a 10-year-old girl in autumn 2016. The case attracted a great deal of attention because both the local district court and the court of appeal decided against handing down a verdict for aggravated rape. The prosecution sought leave to appeal the verdict. It wanted a harsher conviction for the defendant – a 23-year-old asylum seeker – on the grounds of aggravated rape as well as the original verdict of aggravated sexual abuse. The prosecution also sought harsher sentencing for the man as well as heavier damages for the victim. However the Supreme Court refused leave to appeal the conviction and sentence, leaving the original appeal court sentence unchanged. The Pirkanmaa District Court and the Turku Appeal Court both convicted the man of aggravated sexual abuse of a minor and sentenced him to a three-year custodial sentence. Both courts found that the man had had sexual intercourse with the child and had performed sexual acts with her by sending messages about sexual matters. Both courts threw out charges brought against the man for aggravated rape. The courts ruled that there was no evidence to indicate that the sexual encounter involved violence or that the child was overcome by fear or incapacitated in any other way. At the time of the incident the victim was 10 and the defendant was 20 years old. The sexual abuse took place in a small town in the Pirkanmaa region, near Tampere. The court judgments sparked spirited national debate last autumn. Legal scholars expressed bewilderment over the finding that the act was not against the victim’s will and did not involve violence. For example, Turku University’s Jussi Tapani and Matti Tolvanen of the University of Eastern Finland, both professors of criminal law, examined the jurisprudence involved in the case in the daily Helsingin Sanomat. Tuula Tamminen, Professor of Child Psychiatry at the University of Tampere, said she was perplexed by the courts’ rulings, telling the daily Aamulehti that there is no way that a child could know what might be happening in such a situation. In November, Yle asked members of Parliament’s Law Committee if the case warranted changes to the legal code. At the time, committee chair and National Coalition Party MP Kari Tolvanen said he supported a longer sentence for such offences. He said that the section of criminal law dealing with aggravated sexual abuse of a child should be amended. ”The amendment would introduce harsher sentences for serious sexual offences against children overall. In my view that is fully justified, for example in light of a child’s vulnerability, even if the act does not meet the threshold for rape,” Tolvanen commented. Earlier this year, Justice Minister Antti Häkkänen called for tougher laws for sex offences against children."
5.12.2018,Police warn of online predators as suspected sex abuse cases uncovered in Oulu,https://yle.fi/uutiset/10540902,"The Oulu police department is advising young girls and their parents to be on the lookout for sexual predators active on social media. According to police, foreign-background men with poor Finnish-language skills have tried to make online contact with ""significantly younger"" underaged girls in the Oulu area. Some of these contacts have led to suspicion of aggravated sexual abuse, the police said.  The Oulu police said it has recently been informed of dozens of cases where adult men try to lure young girls online. ""That's the reason for our warning,"" said Detective Superintendent Markus Kiiskinen.  However, the warning mostly applies to one group of online predators and hopefully will not tarnish the reputation of all migrants, police added. ""I hope this will not result in more racism. The police would like to emphasise that not all people with foreign backgrounds are dishonest or criminals,"" Kiiskinen said.  The police also said parents should take an interest in who their child spends time with both online and offline.  Police are currently investigating three separate cases where migrant men are suspected of sexually abusing children in Oulu.  In one case, a group of men is suspected of sexually exploiting a girl between 10-14 years for a period of several months. The abuse took place in private residences in Oulu. Seven men have been arrested for assault, aggravated sexual abuse of a child and aggravated rape, however no charges have yet been laid. The two other cases occurred during one day and took place outdoors in the Tuira neighbourhood of Oulu. The victims were also under 15 years of age, police said. These cases are being investigated as sexual abuse of a minor, and aggravated sexual abuse and rape of a child, respectively. Police have released the suspect in the first case, but continue to hold the other suspect in custody.  All suspects had arrived in Finland as refugees or asylum seekers, police indicated. Some are Finnish citizens and some have been granted refugee status, while the rest are awaiting asylum decisions. The suspects come from four different countries and are between 20 and 30 years of age, with the exception of one who is over 30.

21.3.2019,"Finnish kids victims of human trafficking, study finds",https://yle.fi/uutiset/10700307,"A new report finds that youths in Finland have been forced into prostitution, and that the sugar dating phenomenon is putting teens at risk. The study was conducted by Elina Kervinen and Natalia Ollus of the European Institute group for Crime Prevention and Control, a UN-affiliated group.  “Human trafficking isn’t visible on the surface,” said Veikko Mäkelä, project manager for the Finnish National Assistance System for Victims of Human Trafficking, an Interior Ministry group which commissioned the report. Police and social workers don’t always realise that human trafficking underlies some cases of sexual abuse or that a teen caught stealing is working for someone else.  Mäkelä and Kervinen both asserted that sugar dating, which most often involves an older man bestowing gifts on a younger woman, sometimes in exchange for sexual favours, puts teens at risk for trafficking. Children taken into state custody or runaways are most vulnerable to traffickers. Drug-addicted youths forced to pay off their debts through prostitution are another at-risk group as are young foreign women sold into marriage with immigrant-background men in Finland. Mäkelä underscores that traffickers are often people close to children – parents, teachers, relatives or friends – individuals that can manipulate a child’s trust. Since becoming a punishable offence in 2004, Finnish courts have handed down six rulings on child trafficking. Five of the six cases involved native Finnish children. One of the cases involved a middle-aged man prostituting a 14-year-old girl after he convinced her to live with him. Another case centred on a drug ring holding an 18-year-old woman captive while prostituting her. Since 2007, the Finnish National Assistance System for Victims of Human Trafficking has dealt with some 200 human trafficking cases involving minors and people under 21.  However Kervinen, who co-authored the report issued on Thursday, said many more victims need help.  Most victims coming through the national assistance system are asylum-seekers, according to Mäkelä.  The report showed that it was easier for authorities to detect human trafficking abuses among asylum-seekers than the native population. Some young asylum-seekers have been sexually abused in their countries of origin, en route to Europe as well as in Finland, according to Mäkelä."
28 4 2020,Police investigate Helsinki child abuse case,https://yle.fi/uutiset/11326815,"Police in Helsinki are investigating the suspected abuse and neglect of a small child in Helsinki.  The suspected crimes came to light just under two weeks ago when police entered an apartment in the Meri-Rastila district of eastern Helsinki and found the child’s mouth had been taped over with a soothing dummy. Authorities are also investigating whether the child had alcohol or drugs in their bloodstream.  ""What happened is being investigated at this stage as assault and neglect,"" Detective Chief Inspector Jutta Antikainen of the Helsinki Police Department said. ""The investigation is ongoing and police are currently waiting for a medical report, among other things.""  Helsingin Sanomat reported on Tuesday that police were responding to a complaint when they entered the apartment, and that the child’s welfare had been previously brought to the attention of child welfare services.  Police were unwilling to comment further on the case, declining to confirm if any action has previously been taken by child protection authorities or other authorities in regard to the child, citing the need to protect the identity of the victim of a suspected crime.  ""The most important thing is that the matter has been brought to the attention of the authorities. We urge anyone who is concerned about the well-being of a loved one, especially a child, to contact the authorities,"" Antikainen added.  Teachers and daycare staff are often the ones to raise issues with social services if they suspect abuse, but many children are not attending daycare centres or schools due to restrictions brought about by the coronavirus pandemic. Authorities have reported seeing a decrease in the number of child protection notifications received in recent weeks, with police opening about 50-100 fewer investigations per week involving crimes against children than at the same time last year. ""The biggest concern is with children whose distress is not being seen,"" social worker Sonja Soini from Save the Children told Helsingin Sanomat. This concern prompted police to remind the public that everyone has a responsibility to act if they suspect a crimes such as the neglect of or violence against children. “In acute situations, notifications should be made to the emergency number 112. It is also worth making a child protection notification at the stage where there is concern about the family's situation” Antikainen said."
24 6 2020,Man sentenced to 5 years in prison for sexual abuse of children,https://yle.fi/uutiset/11416587,"A district court in south west Finland has found a man guilty on multiple charges of sexual offenses against children and sentenced him to five years in prison.  The defendant had faced charges including aggravated sexual abuse of a child, aggravated child rape, and the possession and dissemination of indecent images of children. The victims were from different parts of Finland. One charge of aggravated sexual abuse involved a child born in 2017, who was indecently assaulted and photographed by the defendant. The prosecutor had demanded that the charge of aggravated rape of this child be added to the case, but the court dismissed this due to a lack of evidence. The man had used a number of different social media channels, including Instagram, to 'groom' children aged between nine and 13. Once he initiated contact with his victims, he turned the conversation to matters of a sexual nature, such as requesting them to send nude photos.  The court also heard that the defendant had sent photos of his own genitals to a number of the victims.  The crimes took place between 2019 and 2020, and were brought to the attention of Finnish police through tip-offs from both domestic and international sources. The court also ordered the defendant to pay a total of 35,000 euros compensation to the victims.  The decision of the district court is not final, leaving the man an opportunity to appeal. "
8 6 2020,Appeal Court reduces sentence for teacher convicted of child sex abuse,https://yle.fi/uutiset/11390203,"The Helsinki Appeal Court on Monday reduced the sentence of an over-40-year-old teacher convicted for acts of child sex abuse committed at a city school between 2013 and 2017. A lower court found the man guilty of touching pupils during class and sending them photos of his genitals as well as images depicting homosexual sex acts. In December 2018, the Helsinki District Court handed down an 18-month suspended sentence to the man on nine counts of child sex abuse. He was also ordered to pay damages ranging from 1,200 to 1,500 euros to victims. However the man appealed his sentence and on Monday the appellate court reduced the suspended sentence from 18 to 14 months. The appeal court ruled that not all of the instances when the man touched the pupils could be considered child sex abuse.  It rejected the lower court’s argument that touching the head, hair and neck and massaging the shoulders were sexual acts. It said that they were not sexual acts that could damage a child’s development and therefore in light of the circumstances were not sexual in nature. However it found that touching the children near their genitals, on their thighs and on their stomachs constituted sexual acts. With regard to one of the victims, the appeal court considered the question of whether or not the teacher knew that the recipient of his photos was under the age of 16. In Finland the age of consent is 16. It ruled that the teacher did know and therefore his action was premeditated. He had sent a 15-year-old student photos of his genitals and his anus. The appeal court did not reduce sentencing with regard to the damages the teacher was ordered to pay."
10 7 2018,"Supreme Court upholds fine for ""paedophile hunter"" who outed convicted child sex abuser",https://yle.fi/uutiset/10297842,"Finland’s Supreme Court has upheld a sentence handed down by an appeal court in the case of a self-declared ""paedophile hunter"" who used a Facebook page to out a man convicted of child sexual abuse. The defendant, Mikko Parantainen of Äänekoski in central Finland had previously been convicted by a district court on charges of disseminating information that violated personal privacy and slapped with a 40-day fine. Parantainen had also been ordered to pay costs and damages amounting to 5,500 euros. Parantainen appealed the district court verdict and sentence to the appeal court and later to the Supreme Court, but both appellate courts upheld the previous verdict and sentencing. The charges were originally filed as a result of a Facebook page that Parantainen maintained, ""For paedophile victims"", where he published a photo of a man convicted of aggravated child sex abuse. The man had been sentenced to two years in prison for sexually abusing a 14-year-old girl in Outokumpu, eastern Finland. The image came from the convicted man’s own Facebook profile and Parantainen linked the photo to a news item that revealed his name. The convicted man later lodged a request for a police investigation into Parantainen’s actions. In delivering its ruling, the Supreme Court found that the right to live in peace is a fundamental part of private life and also extends to persons convicted of criminal offences. The Court said that the availability online of information about persons guilty of criminal activity does not mean that such information can be freely published in various contexts.  According to the higher court, the publication of the man’s photograph in particular was a gross violation of the convicted man’s privacy."
2 6 2020,Police refer child sexual abuse case with 30 victims to prosecutors,https://yle.fi/uutiset/11380355,"Police in southwestern Finland have passed a case involving an exceptionally large number of child sexual offenses to prosecutors for consideration.  The suspect, a native Finnish man, has been in custody since early spring after police were alerted to his suspected crimes through both domestic and international tips. He is being held on suspicion of multiple counts of aggravated sexual abuse of a child, aggravated child rape, and the possession and dissemination of indecent images of children. Police believe he used social media networks to facilitate his crimes.  All of the suspected victims uncovered so far were girls between the ages of 8 and 14. Police have identified at least 30 victims from all over Finland, and the identities of more victims may be ascertained as joint investigations continue with both Finland’s National Bureau of Investigation and a number of international agencies.  Of the victims known so far, 13 preliminary investigations have been completed and the files passed on to the prosecutor for consideration.  Three other individuals have also been the subject of a preliminary investigation related to the suspected crimes, which is being conducted by officers at the Turku Central Police Station. In a press release, police reminded parents and guardians of children that feelings of shame often prevent victims from telling other people what has happened to them. Therefore, parents should monitor the safe use of social media by children, and create an atmosphere in the home where even difficult subjects can be discussed."
10 10 2019,"Thursday's papers: Finland suspends arms exports, unhealthy wood smoke, and Catholic church child sex abuse",https://yle.fi/uutiset/11013437,"Most of the newspapers cover Turkey's incursion into Kurdish-held areas of northern Syria, with the main Swedish daily scooping its rivals when Defence Minister Antti Kaikkonen told Hufvudstadsbladet that Finland will suspend arms imports to Turkey. The move follows an attack by Turkish troops on Kurdish militia in northeast Syria on Wednesday. Just three weeks ago, the government granted Tampere-based unmanned aircraft system company Robonic the right to export drones to Turkey. The Peace Union of Finland has deeply criticised Robonic's permit, saying the decision to issue it signalled an ""inconsistent"" foreign policy and ""weak"" human rights approach. That said, Finland’s Foreign Ministry states that “through its own actions, Finland seeks to strengthen the international arms control agreements and arrangements.” In 2018, Finland exported defence materiel worth 128 million euros, a 17 percent increase over the previous year, according to the Defence Ministry. With the weather cooling, hundreds of thousands of residents are burning wood to heat their homes. However Finland pays little attention to the particle pollution the practice generates, writes Helsingin Sanomat. Jarkko Tissari, a researcher specialised in wood burning emissions from the University of Eastern Finland, told the paper that there’s been no driving force or regulation in Finland to limit these types of emissions even though HS estimates they contribute to 200 premature deaths annually. Particle-capturing filters are common in houses in central Europe and the United States, but in Finland only industrial buildings are required to install them. One expert told HS that the cost of fitting homes with filters was likely a deterrent to widespread use. The Swedish-language daily HBL also reports that Finland’s Catholic Church is calling for any possible sex abuse victims to come forward, saying a priest who worked in Finland between 1993 and 2003 has been accused of child sexual abuse in the United States.  The priest was ordained in Norway and worked closely with Finland’s Catholic Vietnamese community, according to the Helsinki diocese."
15 11 2019,Churches cancel concerts over ex-tango star's child sexual abuse charges,https://yle.fi/uutiset/11071191,"Two churches have announced the cancellation of proposed concerts by former tango star Jari Sillanpää over child sexual abuse charges.  On Friday, best-selling Finnish solo artist Sillanpää was charged with child sex abuse and disseminating indecent images of children. The suspected abuse is believed to have taken place in August 2017, while the distribution of the indecent material was alleged to have occurred in September 2017. The offences were alleged to have taken place in Helsinki. On Friday, the Jyväskylä parish of the Lutheran Evangelical Church announced that a concert scheduled for 4 December at the Taulumäki church had been called off.  ""As soon as we received the information we began to think of the next steps. We don't want to assume the role of a judge, but these are very serious charges. After due consideration we decided that we would not have the concert,"" Jyväskylä vicar Arto Viitala said.  He added that other parishes were considering pulling Sillanpää concerts from their Christmas calendars. ""It's not certain but it's in the air,"" Viitala continued. Another event due to take place at the Ristinkirkko church in Lahti was also cancelled. ""You cannot come to sing in a church with these kinds of allegations,"" Keski-Lahti vicar Miika Hämäläinen commented. Yle first reported on the suspicions of child sexual abuse involving the solo artist in August 2018. Prosecutor Nina Keskinen told Yle that the charges filed are related to the previously reported case. However the charge sheet outlines a more serious offence than originally considered. According to previous reports, Sillanpää was suspected of being in possession of indecent images. However current charges involve alleged child sexual abuse as well as disseminating indecent photo material. The case will be heard in the Helsinki district court at the end of February next year. According to the prosecutor, the charges are not related to any other larger cluster of cases. ""It [the case] will likely be heard behind closed doors and the documents will be sealed,"" Keskinen said. In late summer last year, Sillanpää took to Facebook to say that police had questioned him because devices seized at his home suggested that he was in possession of illegal material. At the time, he said that officers had been able to retrieve from his computer images and videos that he denied having ever seen. Sillanpää then added that anyone attending the same parties he had participated in could have used his computer. ""I have not had in my possession any offensive material about children,"" he wrote. The singer’s lawyer Riitta Leppiniemi told news agency STT that her client denied both charges. She added that the child sexual abuse charges relate to suspicions not linked to physical contact. ""The charges do not contend that Sillanpää had physical contact or physical intercourse with a minor. According to the charge, it [the alleged offence] was about something besides physical contact,"" Leppiniemi told the agency. ""I can say that Sillanpää denies the charges. Whether or not the act that the prosecutor is alleging meets the criteria for abuse, will be determined in court,"" she continued. Child sexual abuse may also be suspected in cases that do not involve touching or sexual contact. For example, sexual messages with someone who is 16 or younger can meet the criterion. Prosecutor Nina Keskinen told STT that Sillanpää’s charges relate to one victim. ""I can also confirm that the charge has to do with something other than physical contact,"" she commented. The charges have cast a shadow over the fate of other concerts the entertainer has planned this autumn. His calendar includes church concerts in locations such as Fuengirola in Spain as well as Vihti and Helsinki in Finland.  Sillanpää’s concert producer told daily Helsingin Sanomat that a concert scheduled for Saturday in Joensuu as well as the autumn tour will take place as scheduled.  In August last year the Helsinki district court convicted Sillanpää on two narcotics charges and sentenced him to a 10-month suspended prison sentence. The court ruled that the singer had acquired 108 grams of amphetamine and that he had brought another half-gram of methamphetamine to Finland from Thailand. Sillanpää admitted to using drugs himself and to giving them to his friends for free."
19 11 2019,12-year jail sentence for man convicted of child sex abuse,https://yle.fi/uutiset/11076123,"The Southwest Finland District Court has sentenced a 50-year-old man to 12 years in prison for aggravated child sex abuse offences that targeted several victims. On Monday the court handed down five different verdicts following a closed-door trial. According to a report released by the court, the man was found guilty of aggravated child sexual abuse and aggravated rape committed in Turku and other parts of Finland between 2014 and 2019 and aggravated rape of a child between May and June of this year. In the most egregious case, the man was found to have had sexual intercourse with a child on at least 100 occasions and over a period of several years. The sex acts were photographed and recorded on video and the victim was someone close to the defendant. The court ruled that the offence was aggravated because it caused harm to the victim because of the child’s age and level of development. The court also found that the child was in a dependent position in relation to the defendant and was also helpless, a factor that met the criteria for the definition of rape. In another ruling, the same defendant was found guilty of aggravated child sex abuse committed abroad in 2008 and for coercing a victim into sexual activity in 2011, an offence that was also committed abroad. In another verdict, the man was found guilty of disseminating indecent images in 2015. The court ordered that the identities of the victims and their guardians as well as court documents be kept secret for 60 years. The court judgments and legal provisions were not sealed. The defendant was sentenced to pay damages to the victims and to serve 12 years in prison. "
25 6 2018,Suspected paedophile uses volunteer programme as cover for child sex abuse,https://yle.fi/uutiset/10272910,"Anja* and her son are awaiting a court verdict in the case of a man who sexually abused the youngster under the guise of working as a volunteer “support figure” provided for an NGO. In summer 2016, the family was introduced to the man via an organisation whose head described him in glowing terms as ""a real gem."" The man came into the lives of Anja and her son at a time when the single mother was burnt out. He helped ease her burdens by taking the youngster to ice skate and introducing him to new hobbies. He even allowed him to spend nights at his place. “In the beginning I remember thinking that this is too good to be true. But then I thought that since the guy was often late, he certainly wasn’t some kind of narcissist,” Anja explained. But Anja’s initial instinct was right – it was too good to be true. The man turned out to be a paedophile. One Sunday, Anja noticed a strange inflexion in her son's tone when she asked about the night he’d spent at the volunteer's flat. But he soon returned to normal and the child went on to spend a full year in the man’s company. All of that changed in autumn 2017, when the man was caught. The mother of another victim filed a criminal report when her son told her parents about sexual abuse. The man came to know the second child through a hobby where the man had a supervisory role in the club. Anja said that the world stopped spinning when she received a text message from the police inviting her son in to be interviewed. It was only months later that her son revealed some of the more disturbing details of his encounters with his helper. He spoke of a hot flat where he had to take off all his clothes. Being taken to the cellar and forced into the shower. Sleeping naked next to the man and waking when the man pressed his private parts against him from behind. Parents often warn their children against being lured into a vehicle by a man offering treats, but in the majority of reported cases of sexual abuse, perpetrators and their victims know each other. According to police, nowadays, most paedophiles find their victims online, but they also often establish links with children face to face. Occasionally, police also encounter instances where offenders find their victims through various NGOs, for example in hobbyist or sports clubs. There is no research material in Finland establishing the role of volunteer organisations in helping sexual predators gain access to children. Experts interviewed by Yle said that every year officials uncover cases of child sexual abuse linked to volunteer programmes. Experts say that some people who are sexually attracted to minors deliberately seek out situations that bring them into contact with children, while others avoid them as far as possible. On the other hand, sexual attraction toward minors does not necessarily lead directly to abuse, however feelings toward a specific child are surprisingly common, experts said, adding that data show that the vast majority of child sexual abusers are men. In research conducted in Finland one year ago, 3.3 percent of male respondents said that they were sexually drawn to under 16 year-olds, while 0.2 percent said they were attracted to children under the age of 12. In a population the size of Finland’s, that represents roughly 90,000 and 5,500 men respectively. Research has shown that sexual attraction to children is partly inherited and may be related to sexual abuse that perpetrators have suffered in their own childhood. In the case of Anja’s son, the man responsible for the abuse went on trial for charges including child sexual abuse and aggravated rape. The defendant had photographed most of his acts. The victims were all pre-puberty and numbered around 10. The worst offences against Anja’s son were committed while the child was asleep. The accused requested a psychiatric assessment to reveal whether or not he was criminally responsible for his actions. The evaluation will be available in autumn, after which the court will deliver a verdict. Until then, Anja and her son are calmly awaiting the outcome. They said they believe that the man will be convicted – he had confessed to nearly all of the charges against him. Tellingly, Anja said that her son wanted a new support person – but the family would not be turning to the same organisation for assistance. The boy’s mother said that she is still awaiting an apology from the NGO.  She said she wants to hear the group take responsibility for what happened. To say how sorry they are and to admit that there were shortcomings in their operations. And most importantly, to promise to make changes. “I don’t want to hear that they are shocked – they probably all are. But they were shockingly gullible in terms of [dealing with] paedophiles. We have paid the price for that. And it’s wrong.” * Name of the mother changed and names of the young victim and NGO withheld to protect the privacy of the individuals involved."
23 4 2019,Oulu sex abuse trial begins,https://yle.fi/uutiset/10751427,"A 21-year-old Afghan is on trial in Oulu accused of aggravated sexual abuse and aggravated rape of a girl under the age of 15. The case, which started on Tuesday, involves eight men of foreign background are accused of abusing a girl aged under 15 over a period of five months in 2018. The eight defendants are to stand trial separately, and proceedings will not be held in public because of their sensitive nature. Pre-trial investigations are complete in three of the remaining seven suspects, with trials set to start over the spring and summer. The case came to the attention of police in late summer 2018, with eight men suspected of abusing the girl and five of them suspected aggravated rape. Three are suspected of physical assault and four of buying sexual services from a minor. In addition, one is suspected of keeping an indecent picture of a child. Police say the case is exceptional because the large number of abusers all knew each other. Child abuse itself is not rare: police investigated some 1,000 cases nationwide last year. Last month a 22-year-old man was convicted of raping a 14-year-old girl he met on Snapchat, in a case that was part of a spate of sex abuse cases in Oulu involving men of an immigrant background. Police have faced criticism for quickly publicising the case and other similar ones in Oulu. Their response is that grooming on social media seemed to be a phenomenon at the time, and it was necessary to inform and warn the public. Authorities stress that online grooming cases have included both Finnish and foreign suspects."
9.4.2015,"""Paedophile hunter"" slapped with fine and damages bill",https://yle.fi/uutiset/7918776,"The defendant Mikko Parantainen was found guilty of spreading defamatory information for publishing the name and photo of a convicted paedophile in the social networking site Facebook. The north Karelian district court found Parantainen guilty of the charges brought against him and sentenced him to pay a fine of 1,880 euros. He was also ordered to pay damages to the tune of 1,000 euros for the suffering his actions caused, and to pay legal expenses amounting to 2,500 euros. Parantainen was the administrator of a site defending paedophile victims, which was shut down last year. The plaintiff in the case received an eight-year prison sentence from the northern Karelian district court for aggravated child sexual abuse of a 14-year old girl. The incident occurred in Outokumpu three years ago. Parantainen published a photo of the man and linked it to a news item about the case by the commercial broadcaster MTV; the news report also named the defendant. The self-appointed paedophile tracker said he did not infringe on anyone's privacy by circulating information about the trial, rather he only linked a public photograph to information that was already in the public domain. He argued that his actions were not illegal, and not punishable according to the criminal code. However the district court disagreed with Parantainen’s interpretation and sentenced him to pay a fine, legal costs and damages amounting to 5,500 euros. The sentence was not legally binding."
16.1.2019,"Sex crime probes advance in Helsinki, Oulu",https://yle.fi/uutiset/10599388,"A man who police suspect carried out a number of aggravated rape and aggravated child abuse crimes was ordered to be held in remand custody by Helsinki District Court on Wednesday. Police in eastern Helsinki said they are continuing their preliminary investigation of the case, describing the male suspect as a foreign national born in 1991. Police said they suspect the man carried out a series of sexual abuse crimes against a single victim from October through 9 January 2019. Two other men detained last weekend have since been released. ""Police continue to investigate the case. There is nothing else to say at this stage of the preliminary investigation,"" Helsinki police detective Saara Asmundela said. Meanwhile Oulu police have confirmed that at least one underage victim in the west coast city was drugged before being raped. Oulu police detective Markus Kiiskinen confirmed on Wednesday that they suspect an underage female victim was drugged but that the other suspected cases of sexual abuse being investigated do not appear to have involved the use of drugs. The case is one of a number of suspected sexual assault and abuse cases that police claim took place in the Oulu region last summer and autumn. The first suspected sex abuse cases came to light in early December. Last week police announced new suspected cases there. Police said they are investigating a number of underage or child sexual abuse cases involving 16 suspects, all of whom have foreign backgrounds. Most of the suspects are aged 20-30, while two are under 18. Police say some of the suspects have been granted Finnish citizenship."
8.2.2020,Social media giants tip Finnish police off on thousands of suspicious images,https://yle.fi/uutiset/11199652,"Last year social media networks sent Finland’s National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) some 5,000 tip-offs regarding potential child sex abuse material. Sari Sarani, a cyber crime specialist with the NBI, said incoming alerts multiplied as social media networks started to more closely monitor and report illicit material. Most tip-offs to the NBI pertain to child sex abuse images and attempts by users to groom children for sexual acts.  Sometimes the tips run into a dead end if Finnish police are unable to track down locations or potential victims and perpetrators. In some cases, material flagged by social media companies doesn't raise concern in Finland, particularly in regard to sauna photos. ""In the United States, sharing a Finnish-style sauna photo would most often be considered illicit. In Finland it isn’t unless there’s something sexual about the picture,"" Sarani explained. Cases of children sharing their own naked photos on social media have also landed at the NBI. The bureau may forward these types of cases to child welfare authorities even if there is no evidence of criminal wrongdoing. Police said it’s unclear whether the surge in tip-offs is due to better filters or if online sex crime is becoming more rampant. About five child sex abuse reports were lodged in Finland for every day of 2019, totalling 1,837 counts. Child sex abuse reports in Finland grew by 56 percent over the past two years, according to figures published by the National Police Board on Friday."
7.12.2018,Police probe possible links to child porn in Oulu sex abuse cases,https://yle.fi/uutiset/10544300,"Oulu police said on Friday that they had issued a warrant for one person suspected of sex crimes in the area. According to reports in the Oulu-based paper Kaleva, Detective Chief Inspector Markus Kiiskinen said that officials will move to reveal the suspect’s distinguishing marks if they see fit to do so. Local police are investigating three cases of sexual offences in which all of the suspected victims were girls under the age of 15. The suspects in all three cases came to Finland as quota refugees or asylum seekers. Police said that there are no indications that there are any direct links among the three cases and have said that fresh cases may still come to light. ""We’ll first see if the investigation progresses without revealing [the suspect's] distinguishing marks. Hopefully we won’t have to go there,"" Kiiskinen remarked. ""The most important thing now is to find this person,"" he added. Kiiskinen said that he could not divulge the charge being considered at this stage, but noted that police are not looking at any further suspects. Oulu law enforcement officials are also investigating whether or not several individuals suspected of committing sex crimes involving minors also engaged in disseminating child pornography as part of the preliminary investigation, Kiiskinen revealed. ""We are getting to the bottom of whether or not other criminal offences were committed,"" the chief inspector commented. Police learned of the suspected offences while responding to routine calls, while one tip came via an official source. The investigation includes one case in which a total of seven individuals have been taken into custody. The web of offences emerged at the end of last summer and police say they believe there may be more suspects involved. On Wednesday police hinted that new arrests in the cases were imminent. That case is being investigated as assault, aggravated child sex abuse and aggravated rape and the offences are believed to have taken place at a private residence over a period of several months. Two other suspected offences reportedly occurred outdoors on the same day in Oulu’s Tuira district in mid-November.  One of these incidents is being investigated as child sex abuse while the other may be classified as aggravated rape and aggravated sexual abuse. The suspects hail from four different countries and are between 20 and 30 years of age, with the exception of one who is over 30."
13.3.2018,Justice Minister to push for tougher punishments for child sex crimes,https://yle.fi/uutiset/10114957,"Justice Minister Antti Häkkänen has called for an overhaul of laws around sexual offences committed against children, with tougher punishments and new offences to be considered. Last autumn, a few months after taking office, Häkkänen asked civil servants to come up with proposals on stricter punishments for child sex crimes. Experts have now presented their recommendations for new offences covering the most serious cases. If a case involves both rape and child sexual abuse, there could be a new offence of aggravated rape of a child, carrying a sentence of between four and 12 years. The proposal also looks at raising the maximum sentence for child sex abuse from four to six years. ""Children should be protected from violence and sexual assault by all available means,"" said Häkkänen in a statement. ""I asked officials for proposals on toughening the law on sex crimes. I regard these proposals as viable and I intend to advance them."" Häkkänen's original call for tougher sentencing came in the midst of a public outcry over the case of a man convicted of abusing a ten-year-old girl. He was not convicted of rape, but rather aggravated sexual abuse of a child. An aggravated rape charge was dismissed by the court because of a lack of evidence that the girl did not consent. The prosecutor had sought an aggravated rape conviction on the grounds that the man had used force in the attack, and that the victim was too young to properly defend herself and resist her attacker. The appeals court ruled that youth was not sufficient grounds to rule she was helpless, and that there was insufficient evidence of force being used. "
11.4.2019,Tougher punishments for sexual abuse to take effect next week,https://yle.fi/uutiset/10735063,"Revised legislation on sex crimes against minors takes effect on 15 April in Finland. A new criminal offence of aggravated rape of a child will go on the books, and the upper sentencing limit for sex abuse of a child will be raised. President Sauli Niinistö is expected to sign the bill into law on Friday. A perpetrator found guilty of both aggravated rape and the aggravated sexual abuse of a child in the same act may be punished for aggravated rape of child. What are now considered two separate crimes will be combined into one. The legislation is based on the premise that a child can never provide valid consent to sexual intercourse with an adult. The charge of aggravated rape of a child may be applied in case of violent rape as well as to cases where an underage victim is incapable of defending him or herself or expressing his or her will. The punishment for aggravated rape of a child will be 4-12 years in prison, which extends the maximum prison term by two years from the current situation where the two offences are considered separately. Meanwhile the maximum punishment for sexual abuse of a child will rise from the current four to six years imprisonment. In ratifying the bill, the outgoing Parliament stipulated that the next government must further toughen punishments for sexual offences against minors, particularly the minimum sentences, and that it should launch a comprehensive reform of sex-crime legislation. This follows public outcry over a series of sentences for such crimes that were widely considered to be overly lenient. The past Parliament's four-year term formally ended on Wednesday ahead of Sunday's election. Members of the new legislature are to present their credentials on 23 April."
27.3.2019,Police suspect Finns of role in violent international child porn ring,https://yle.fi/uutiset/10710075,"The National Bureau of Investigation suspects five Finnish citizens of involvement in an extensive child sexual abuse network. Police believe that the suspects engaged in producing material depicting violent child sexual abuse in Finland that was shared live online to other members of the network abroad. ""A special feature [of the case] has been violence and child harm, which has played a central role [in the material]. Although we are investigating sexual offences, this is a case of violence, its glorification and receiving sexual gratification from it,"" said lead investigator Sanna Springare. Springare described the ringleader of the group as a man who had held a prominent position in society. All five suspects are men. Police suspect that the case involves six victims who were all boys ranging in age from six to 15 years old at the time the suspected offences occurred. The suspected crimes were believed to have been committed between 2004 and 2018 and police believe that some of the victims knew each other. Four of the Finnish suspects had been in police custody at some point, but that is no longer the case. According to the NBI, the men were released due to reasons having to do with the investigation as well as the length of the probe. In the case of the ringleader, his detention had lasted around 12 months. Police pointed to an exceptional amount of evidence seized in connection with the case. They now have in their possession 138 electronic devices and the ringleader alone had been holding more than 400 hours of illegal video material. Altogether law enforcement officials had seized 96 terabytes of material. NBI investigators speculated that scope of the material confiscated was equivalent to more than 30 million photos, assuming that the size of an average photo is around three megabytes. However most of the material seized was in video, with images of the Finnish victims among the files. Police are investigating the cases as aggravated child sexual abuse, aggravated rape, aggravated dissemination of indecent images of children, illegal possession of many such images, drug offences and viewing content featuring indecent images of children. The total number of charges under consideration is 22, but they involve 70 offences altogether. Investigators noted however that the statute of limitations on some of the offences has expired. ""In its mildest form, the abuse in Finland occurred as showing adult pornography to children. In the worst cases it involved the rape of children for 10 hours while they were drugged with narcotics,"" Springare explained. Investigators said that in some cases the young victims had been drugged with amphetamines. ""They [the victims] were found through their [the suspects'] ties to various acquaintances,"" Springare explained. ""The suspects were considered to be very reliable. In this way, parents for example ventured to leave their children in the hands of these people who were later revealed to be criminal suspects,"" she added. The precise nature of the offences has to some extent been sealed. According to the NBI some of the suspected crimes took place in a very small municipality so the location of the place has also been kept under wraps to protect the identity of the victims. Police have so far completed their investigation and referred the cases for consideration of charges. The investigations probed an extensive child pornography ring that involved the production of live streamed content in Finland that was then followed in 17 countries. According to the NBI the countries involved were European and included other western states. Springare said that members of the network have received video content and also produced material for the group. Some of the material streamed to Finland was extremely violent in nature and involved so-called snuff films, in which the victims were killed. Some of the photo and video material contained features of devil worship, Nazism and various fetishes, investigators added. The lead investigator said that police have not sought the extradition of suspects from other countries to Finland. ""Sentencing in many other countries is tougher than in Finland, so we hope that the target countries will do their part,"" Springare noted.  None of the victims had alerted the authorities about the abuse they suffered. Police tracked down the victims and suspects on the basis of the material that came their way. Finnish authorities launched an investigation into the suspected offences in 2017 after receiving a tip-off from foreign officials. The NBI alone had assigned seven investigators to work on the case almost full-time."
4.4.2019,Yle talk show on Michael Jackson paedophilia doc sparks hotline calls in Finland,https://yle.fi/uutiset/10723435,"Sexual health and youth support organisations in Finland said they registered a spike in calls from concerned members of the public following the screening of the controversial documentary Leaving Neverland, which claims the late ""king of pop"" Michael Jackson abused young boys. Many of those who called support hotlines who said they'd been victims of sexual abuse as kids also said they were talking about it for the first time. Sex therapist Roni Grinberg works at the Sexpo Foundation, which educates and assists people with questions about sexuality. He said that the organisation's telephone hotline was quite busy after an Yle talk show about the difficult subject of child sex abuse was released online on Tuesday. The Docventures programme was a special edition of the show released as a companion piece to the documentary Leaving Neverland, which is also being streamed on Yle Areena. The film chronicles Jackson's alleged long-time relationship with two boys and their families as well as the now-adult men's claims that he sexually abused them when they were children. Grinberg, who was answering calls to the hotline on Tuesday, said it was a very interesting night, adding that some of the calls came from people worried about their own sexual histories and proclivities. Grinberg noted that it was good that callers reached out for help, and that the talk show's move to address such a difficult matter may have prompted them to reach out. Some individuals who called Sexpo's help line said it was the first time they'd ever spoken out loud about having been sexually exploited during their childhoods. Grinberg noted that talking about the subject raises strong emotions, but the ability to talk about them in a safe setting can also offer relief. Other support organisations reported that the Docventures special prompted calls to them, as well. These included Suomen Delfins, a group that supports people who were victims of sexual abuse or exploitation as children, as well as their relatives. The organisation's manager, Liisa Kaukio-Rasilainen, said dozens of people reached out for assistance on their online chat. ""About half of those who contacted us said they were talking about the matter for the first time. We also expect more people to contact us in the future as people gain more courage,"" Kaukio-Rasilainen said. NGO Mannerheim League for Child Welfare hosted an online chat and hotline service, as well. Tatjana Palomäki, head of the organisation's hotline, said she was glad that the topic of child sex abuse had been brought into the national conversation. ""Children and young people have been talking about [the effects of paedophilia] for at least a decade now. Talking openly about it helps to lower the threshold for people to seek help and improves parents' ability to identify changes in their children's well-being,"" Palomäki said. It was mostly fathers who called Sexpo on Tuesday, with many saying they had been victims of sexual violence themselves and were concerned about the possibility that they could also become paedophiles, according to Grinberg. ""This type of worry is usually unwarranted, but it would be a good idea for people who have these kinds of questions to talk to a professional. Personal histories that go unaddressed can create unnecessary stress and ill feelings. They are easily reflected in daily family lives and family relations,"" Grinberg said. Admitting to having sexual thoughts about underage children is not illegal in Finland, but acting on such desires in the real world is. Despite this, people are usually still reluctant to talk about these kinds of thoughts because the issue carries deep moral ramifications and emotions. The Sexpo Foundation and the NGO Foundation for Supporting Ex-offenders have launched a campaign which aims to prevent the sexual abuse of children. Sexual attraction to children is something that those affected usually notice early on in life, according to Grinberg. He said it is particularly important for young people to talk about these kinds of feelings and to seek help - not only for their own sakes, but also as a way to prevent potential future offences.  ""The young people who called were worried that they could become paedophiles because they had been victims themselves. Many of them said they felt shame and guilt about what happened to them. The human mind often causes victims to start blaming themselves,"" Grinberg said. The therapist said that many women also called in to express concerns about being at risk of being or becoming paedophiles. ""In these types of matters women may be even more stigmatised than men,"" Grinberg said, noting that he was impressed by how honest and open callers were about their feelings. He said everyone needs to be listened to without prejudice, given that they aren't admitting to having done something illegal."
12.7.2019,Oulu court hands down last sentences in string of 2018 sex crimes,https://yle.fi/uutiset/10876175,"Oulu District Court on Friday handed down its last rulings in a string of sexual crimes committed in the northern city last year by foreign-born men. Eight men were convicted of raping and abusing the same female victim. The girl was aged 12-13 at the time of the assaults, which mostly took place in the summer and autumn of 2018. All eight men were sentenced to prison, the last two on Friday. They were Qayssar Mohsin Sbahi Aldhulaiei, 26, and Abdo Ibrahim Ahmed, 33. Aldhulaiei was sentenced to four years in prison for aggravated rape, aggravated sexual abuse of a child and assault. Ahmed was sentenced to four years and two months for aggravated rape, aggravated sexual abuse of a child and possession of child pornography. He was found to be in possession of a video showing an unidentified child, who was not the same as the victim in the eight cases. His crimes took place in 2017 and 2018. The two men were each ordered to pay the victim 23,000 euros in damages. They denied being guilty of sexual crimes. One claimed that he thought the victim was 17 and a half years old, but the court did not find this believable. Prosecutors say that the eight cases followed similar patterns, but that not all of the perpetrators knew each other. The men contacted the girl via various social media channels and lured her to apartments or hotels, where they individually inflicted sexual violence on her and forced her into various acts. Prosecutors point out that even attempting to lure a child for sexual purposes and sending sexually-tinged messages to a child are crimes and may be harmful to the victim. Of the eight perpetrators, the longest prison term went to Hassan Mohamud Mohamed, 38, who was sentenced earlier this week to four and a half years in prison for aggravated sexual abuse of a child and aggravated rape in 2017 and 2018. The trials have been going on since April, with sentencing beginning in May. The first five convicts were sentenced to 2-4 years imprisonment, along with fines ranging from just over 8,000 euros to 23,000 euros each. Oulu police say that all eight came to Finland as refugees or asylum seekers. Some have already been granted refugee status or Finnish citizenship, while others' applications are still pending. The prosecutor says that so far six of those convicted have expressed dissatisfaction with their sentences and that some have already filed appeals. Terttu Utriainen, a professor emeritus of criminal law from the University of Lapland, says that in general these sentences have been tougher than in the past. ""Previously suspended sentences have usually been handed down for sexual crimes. Apparently the penalisation practices are becoming tougher,"" she told Yle. Utriainen notes that a convict with no previous criminal record is usually released after serving half of his or her prison term. ""And convicts who do not hold Finnish citizenship can be deported when they have carried out their sentences,"" she adds."
18.1.2019,Finland to review international conventions in light of alleged child sex crimes,https://yle.fi/uutiset/10603648,"Finland’s Foreign Ministry plans to conduct a review of international agreements to which the country is a signatory to determine whether or not they can be changed to better manage immigration policy. The decision followed a cabinet meeting by the Juha Sipilä administration convened to address alleged child sexual abuse cases in Oulu, northern Finland. Government ministers also reviewed the situation with respect to individuals whose asylum applications had been rejected by Finnish authorities. The meeting concluded that authorities need to place greater emphasis on the deportation of rejected asylum seekers from Iraq. Finland also plans to take up the issue of rejected asylum seekers with the EU Commission and intends to raise the matter with other countries in the same position. Police commissioner Seppo Kolehmainen provided ministers with an update in investigations into the reported cases of child sexual abuse in Oulu and Helsinki. The government concluded that police need to place greater emphasis on their online operations. ""It was clear that more police resources are needed, especially for the internet. The background to many of these cases is online grooming and police need more resources for that, even if they are provided at the beginning of this year,"" Prime Minister Juha Sipilä said in Parliament on Friday. The government noted that cases of child sex abuse linked to the internet as prevalent and very few of them come to the attention of police. Meeting participants decided to set up a tripartite working group involving school, youth outreach and social workers to come up with preventive measures. In addition, an internal security working group lead by Interior Minister Kai Mykkänen has been charged with developing a package of measures by mid-February. ""It is certainly worrying that in terms of the entire country, the number of sexual offences under investigation has increased during the past year. Especially here in the Helsinki region, that growth has been significant. Of course, it can be linked to a lower threshold for reporting [the offences],"" the minister said in parliament. In a previous meeting on Tuesday, the government had promised additional funding to beef up police resources to combat offences committed against children. At the time parliamentary groups agreed to fast-track three pieces of legislation to deal with sexual offences against children. The first would impose harsher sentences for aggravated child sex crimes, another would allow police broader access to personal data, while a third would amend laws so that naturalised citizens convicted of sex offences would lose their citizenship."
25.2.2019,New charges in Oulu sexual abuse cases,https://yle.fi/uutiset/10661940,"The prosecutor's office in Oulu says that charges of aggravated child sexual abuse and aggravated rape have been formally filed against a defendant in custody described as a man of foreign background born in 1975. The offenses are thought to have taken place in the city centre and in the Tuira district of the city. The accused has denied the charges. This is reportedly the second set of charges filed in a recent series of investigations into sex crimes in Oulu. Earlier this month, charges of aggravated child sexual abuse and aggravated rape were brought against a 22 year-old man also of foreign background.  A court will begin proceedings in that case on Tuesday 26.2. The defendant has denied the charges. Investigations of sex crimes in Oulu have been the focus of major media coverage since eight men were detained in December. None of those eight cases have yet gone to court."
31.1.2017,Court sentences man to nine years in prison for dozens of child sex crimes,https://yle.fi/uutiset/9433317,"The court sentenced the 32 year-old defendant to 9.5 years in prison for convictions on one count of aggravated child sexual abuse, 29 counts of child sexual abuse and three counts of sexual abuse. Petri Joonas Ylönen has been in prison since April 2015 and remained in detention during his court hearing.   The court heard that the man used different online discussion forums to befriend young girls under the age of 16. The defendant’s sentence also reflected convictions for six counts of distributing indecent sexual images and 25 counts of possession of indecent sexual images of children. The man was also ordered to pay a total of 98,000 euros compensation to 28 plaintiffs for suffering he caused them. A psychiatric evaluation found that the man was criminally responsible for his actions."
13.1.2019,Helsinki police detain three on suspicion of child sex offences,https://yle.fi/uutiset/10594230,"Helsinki police said Sunday that they had held three men on Saturday evening on suspicion of aggravated child sexual abuse and aggravated rape. However they did not specify whether or not both of the offences applied to all of the suspects, who reportedly have foreign backgrounds. Officials said they are investigating a series of offences they believe took place during the past two months at an eastern Helsinki residence, however they declined to disclose the number of alleged victims as well as their ages. Finnish news agency STT previously reported that the men were held in Helsinki’s Roihuvuori district, however police did not confirm this information to Yle but said that the operation took place in eastern Helsinki. On Saturday night STT said that police raided a home in Roihuvuori and that officials at the time said that the operation related to a previous investigation. The police raid was first reported by tabloid Ilta-Sanomat. Police said that they would not provide any further updates on the case at this stage. Police in Oulu are investigating several cases of suspected child sexual abuse, the first of which came to light late last year. No charges have yet been laid in those cases. Since the investigations came to light there have been repeated calls for dual nationals convicted of serious crimes to be stripped of Finnish citizenship. On Saturday President Sauli Niinistö said that it is ""unacceptable"" that more cases of suspected child sexual abuse had been uncovered in Oulu. ""It is unacceptable that some people who have asked for and even received asylum from us have brought evil here and created [a sense of] insecurity here,"" the President said in a statement. He added that the right to personal integrity is among the values on which Finnish society is based and with which everyone should comply. ""As I said in connection with the previous suspects, the actions in Oulu have shocked us because of their inhumanity. This was compounded by the fact that they targeted children,"" he added. However Niinistö noted that migrants should be given a chance to settle in Finland. ""Even in the most sensitive matters we need an open and pragmatic discussion and should weigh decisions carefully. Problems must be addressed and solved. That is the right of all those people who want to adjust to our society, regardless of their background."" Edit: Updated at 11.31am to include comments by President Sauli Niinistö."
13.2.2019,Yet another suspected sexual abuse case in Oulu,https://yle.fi/uutiset/10644762,"Police in the northern Finnish city of Oulu said on Wednesday that they have uncovered yet another suspected sex crime against a minor. The case is being investigated as suspected aggravated rape and aggravated sexual abuse of a child. Police believe that the crime took place in a private flat in January, and that the victim was a 14-year-old girl. Police say the latest case came to light while they were investigating two other sex crimes believed to have occurred last weekend. That case, which was reported on Tuesday, centres on the suspected rape of two girls in an Oulu apartment.  One victim is described as being under age 16 and the other as under 18. Authorities say the victims knew each other. Police told Yle that social media did not play a role in these two cases, unlike other similar cases in the city in recent months.  Oulu District Court has remanded a man described as being ""of foreign background"" in pre-trial detention in connection with the crimes. Authorities say he may face charges including aggravated rape, aggravated sexual abuse of a child, assault and coercion.  According to Detective Superintendent Markus Kiiskinen, both investigations are in their early stages.  Since December, officials in Oulu have been probing about 10 cases in which men ""of foreign background"" are suspected of sex crimes against minors. In many of the cases, victims say they were approached via social media. Also on Wednesday, the district prosecutor charged a 22-year-old man ""of foreign background"" with aggravated rape and aggravated sexual abuse of a child. The assault against a 14-year-old girl is alleged to have occurred outdoors in the Tuira neighbourhood in the northern part of Oulu on 17 November. Another sex crime against a minor is believed to occurred on the same date in the same district. "
3.9.2019,"Tuesday's papers: Child grooming, Kela benefits delays and rain moves in",https://yle.fi/uutiset/10951873,"So far this year, residents have reported some 1,500 sexual offences against minors to the police, writes national daily Helsingin Sanomat. A quarter of the reported incidents are in the capital city region. The paper asks how it’s possible that some perpetrators are able to sexually abuse multiple young victims over long periods of time without being caught. Kirsi Porras, who has worked with sexually abused kids for 15 years at the Family Federation of Finland, told HS that abusers are master manipulators who are able to make victims feel special. Many also use secret-keeping as a way of keeping children quiet about abuse, particularly when the abuser plies underage victims with alcohol and drugs. Because of easy exposure to explicit content online, experts told HS that parents need to have frank discussions with their children about what's appropriate on social media when they get their own devices--if not before. Leena Salovartio at the Prosecutor General's Office meanwhile pointed to a lack of resources when it comes to crimes against children. ""Everyone has a heart when it comes to these matters but that doesn't translate into funding or more personnel,"" she said. Several news outlets, including online magazine Uusi Suomi, report on social insurer Kela's announcement of possible delays to benefits processing due to the postal worker strike. Kela pointed out that unemployment and income support benefits may be delayed, especially if claimants have sent in documents via mail. The strike that began on Sunday evening to protest pay cuts ends at midnight on Wednesday. Finland has basked in a sunny and summer-like start to September, but according to Ilta-Sanomat, many parts of the country will see rain in the coming days. Daytime highs around the country will still remain in a mild 15-20 degree Celsius range. With warm weather continuing into early September, this summer has brought more hot--or above 25-degree-weather--days than usual to most of the country, according to the the Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI)."
11.1.2019,Oulu police probe four new cases of suspected under-age sex abuse,https://yle.fi/uutiset/10593090,"Police in Oulu said Friday that they have launched a preliminary investigation into four fresh cases of suspected sexual abuse of girls under the age of 15. The department added that four foreign background suspects have been held in connection with the case. The announcement follows a previous round of investigations last November in which eight immigrant-background men were detained on suspicion of committing five similar offences against underage girls. Police say that the suspected offences under consideration are currently rape, aggravated child sexual abuse and child sexual abuse. In a release issued on Friday, police said that the alleged offences took place during summer 2018. Law enforcement have held three foreign-background individuals in connection with the crimes. Police suspect four people of the alleged offences, two of whom are about 20 and two are minors. Police confirmed the death of one victim last year and said that no foul play was involved. However they declined any further comment on that matter, citing an ongoing investigation into the cause of death. Police said that they will continue the probe into the new reports as well as the five cases previously reported in November. So far no charges have been laid in relation to the suspected offences committed in November. Edit: Updated at 12.01am on 12 January to clarify that two of the suspects involved in the latest cases are adult men while the other two are minors."
20.12.2005,Drive To Block Online Child Porn,https://yle.fi/uutiset/5221410,"Transport and Communications Minister Susanna Huovinen says operators have expressed interest in voluntarily placing filters to prevent access to Internet sites featuring child porn. Huovinen says that blocking access would be quite legal. A task force set up by the Ministry has examined whether police have the right to give operators lists of suspected child porn sites. Operators have not wanted to determine themselves which sites would be banned. For example, Swedish and Danish Internet operators have installed filters. In Sweden, filters were installed in May and currently block up to 30,000 attempts to access child porn sites daily. In Finland, the Transport and Communications Ministry says that within a couple of months it will be taking the first concrete steps to encourage operators to block access to child porn sites. It still needs to look at how much filters would cost operators and what would be the best way technically to block access. The possession or distribution of child pornography is against the law in Finland. Just looking at such pictures on the internet is not illegal however"
18.12.2018,German police release suspect in Oulu underage sex abuse case after communication glitch,https://yle.fi/uutiset/10560310,"A 25-year-old man suspected of the sexual abuse of a girl under the age of 15 in Oulu, northwestern Finland, who was arrested in Germany last Tuesday is now reported to be at large. According to law enforcement officials in Oulu, the suspect was released by German police before he could be transferred to Finnish custody due to ""a breakdown in communication between authorities"".  Oulu District Court ordered the suspect to be reprimanded into custody in absentia on suspicion of aggravated sexual abuse of a minor and aggravated rape. Police have issued an international warrant for the man's arrest. Local police in Oulu are investigating five separate cases of sexual offences in which all of the suspected victims were minors.  Police previously announced one major investigation involving eight suspects all of whom came to Finland as quota refugees or asylum seekers. The suspect released by German police is one of eight men being investigated."
15.8.2019,"Thursday's papers: Unread crime reports, slot machines in hospitals, the sun returns",https://yle.fi/uutiset/10923217,"Finland's biggest selling daily Helsingin Sanomat carries a report on how police may have left up to 2,000 tip-offs about suspected sexual crimes against children unopened in an ""email inbox somewhere"".  According to HS, Finnish police were slow to react when people began reporting allegations or suspicions of online sex crimes against children a number of years ago, and did not allocate enough resources to properly deal with the sudden influx of reports. ""What happened in Finland was that when these things started to grow on the web a few years ago, those tips and messages were left somewhere in an email inbox. And we only had two people in the department who ever opened them,"" commissioner Sari Sarani of the police's cybercrimes unit told HS.  However, according to Sarani, the police's practices for recording warnings about the targeting of children online have now changed, with more staff than ever currently handling the reports and investigating of such cases.  Sarani also told HS that the police seek the public's assistance in tackling sexual crimes against children.  Tabloid Iltalehti reports on the decision by Finland's gaming monopoly Veikkaus to ""quietly"" remove eight slot machines from sites which may have been deemed inappropriate.  The gambling firm has been under considerable pressure recently to review the location of some of its machines, as a citizens' initiative calling for their removal from shops and kiosks has now garnered more than 25,000 signatures. According to IL, some of the vending machines which have now been removed were located in shops or cafes connected to hospitals and rehabilitation centres. The tabloid, in a previous report, had raised concerns that certain medications may contribute to gambling addiction.  Marko Peltokorpi, director of sales at Veikkaus, told IL that the firm is reviewing the practice of placing slot machines near hospitals, health clinics and rehabilitation centres.  ""Veikkaus' point of sale criteria state that slot machines should not be placed in premises where the clientele consists mainly of minors,"" Peltokorpi told the tabloid. ""This paragraph has now been interpreted as also extending to locations whose main clientele consists of the sick and elderly.""  HS's sister tabloid Ilta-Sanomat reports that the recent unsettled weather is expected to take a turn for the better, as a high pressure system will bring the sun back to Finland this weekend.  ""The eastern part of the country will be largely clear and sunny on Saturday,"" Iiris Viljamaa, a meteorologist at the Finnish Meteorological Institute tells IS. ""Temperatures should rise to at least 23-24 degrees Celsius.""  Central and southern areas can also expect similar conditions, according to Viljamaa, and she advises people to make the most of the mellow conditions while they last.  Immediately after the weekend, the wind, rain and unstable weather will return to Finland.  Therefore, the tabloid advises, this weekend is an ideal time to start picking mushrooms and berries in the rain-soaked forest, or even just to get outside and enjoy the sunshine, as it may be the last opportunity to do so this summer.

9.6.2020,Jyväskylä man suspected of sexual abuse of 22 kids,https://yle.fi/uutiset/11391772,"The National Bureau of Investigation announced Tuesday that it had wrapped up a preliminary investigation into a series of child sex abuse cases involving 22 victims.  The NBI said in a statement on Tuesday that it had remanded a 41-year-old Jyväskylä resident into custody in connection with the case. Investigators said that the offences involved the use of social media but did not name the platforms the man used. The suspected offences allegedly occurred between 2018 and 2020. Police said that back in 2018, they received several leads about the suspected sexual abuse and began investigating the case in autumn 2019. In October police detained the man as the main suspect in the case. He was released in December and taken into custody once more in mid-April. ""No physical intercourse was suspected in the offences, nor are other persons under suspicion. The case involves the so-called 'grooming' phenomenon, which means approaching children online with sexual intentions,"" lead investigator Sanna Springare said in the statement. The NBI said that investigators cooperated with local police in Jyväskylä and that the case has now been referred to prosecutors in western Finland for consideration of charges."
22.9.2017,"Friday's papers: Child sex abuse, car free day and a two-time lottery winner",https://yle.fi/uutiset/9845528,"Helsingin Sanomat reports on a concerning issue it says hasn't been studied, but is familiar to every professional working with adolescents in Finland today: An uptick in people seeking to pay underage children to have sex. ""Young people are constantly being confronted with offers to buy sex,"" Anna Nuotio of the Exit NGO tells the paper. Exit is an organisation working to prevent the sexual abuse of young people. She says the problem has been a hot topic among teen help groups recently. Nuotio added that the issue should be discussed in terms of child sexual abuse, rather than prostitution. Kirsi Porras of the family welfare advocacy organisation Väestöliitto says their group is also aware of the issue, adding that it includes children as young as 12 or 13. Helsinki Police detective Teija Koskenmäki-Karaharju says online offers to buy sex are being made to children 10 and up. Child protection services have also been tipped off about human trafficking rings bringing underage children into Finland for forced prostitution. Sanna Teiro, head of the Helsinki child protection services' social services, tells HS that something like this was ""unheard of in Finland five years ago."" Most of the attempts to buy sex from underage children occur over the internet, but there are also attempts on the street – anywhere where young people gather in groups. Helsinki Police detective Jari Koski tells the paper that security guards often inform the police about adults that approach the children. Just like young people that hang out regularly in Helsinki know who they can contact if they want to buy drugs, someone in their network of acquaintances is likely to know who is willing to exchange money or alcohol for sex. The age of consent in Finland is 16, but attempts to buy sex from people under 18 are considered a crime under Finnish law. Most of the incidents under investigation by the police have taken place online, and have been uncovered by the police's own criminal investigation unit. ""We discover several cases a week when an active investigation is underway,"" Koskenmäki-Karaharju tells the paper. The tabloid Ilta-Sanomat reminds its readers that this Friday is World Car Free Day, when people are encouraged to leave their car at home for the day and use another form of transport. In Finland the day will be celebrated with various events throughout the country. In Helsinki, the HSL public transport company is offering tickets at a discount, while in Tampere, people can earn a free transit ticket for the day by reporting to the Koskikeskus square and participating in a bit of exercise. Car Free Day marks the end of European Mobility Week, which began on September 16. And Ilta-Sanomat's main competitor, the tabloid Iltalehti contains a story on an against-all-odds two-time lottery winner from Joensuu. The man, who wishes to remain anonymous, has won millions of euros twice in Finnish lotteries, once in the popular weekly Lotto game and again in the add-on game of Jokeri. The first time he won was two years ago, but his second stroke of good luck took place on Wednesday, when his Jokeri line of correct numbers won him the two million-euro jackpot. Finland's gambling monopoly Veikkaus' communications representative Pipsa Öhman tells IL that this is the first time in the company's 77-year history that something like this has happened. The lucky man sat for an interview with Veikkaus when he visited their office to collect his winnings. The press was not allowed to ask the man questions, as he wanted to protect his identity. ""I had the feeling after my first win that I might win again someday,"" he told the gaming operator. IL reports that the multi-millionaire still works two jobs. He told Veikkaus that after this latest win, he might take a half-year off. ""I enjoy my work and it gets people off my back about my wins,"" he explained. The business owner used his first winnings to pay off his debt, invest in his company and buy shares. He says he might use his new jackpot to build a new home. Veikkaus merged with the slot-machine association RAY and Fintoto, the betting company specialising in trotting competitions, at the beginning of the year, raising many concerns about the company's rising monopoly in Finland. Due to its dominant position in the Finnish market, the payout percentages are somewhat lower than many international gaming groups, IL says. "
23.11.2017,"Thursday's papers: Rising anti-psychotic drug use by kids, uproar over child sex abuse verdict, rebranding Finland's famous baby box",https://yle.fi/uutiset/9944202,"Largest circulation daily Helsingin Sanomat’s city pages lead with a look at the growing use of antidepressant and anti-psychotic medication among young teens in Finland. The paper writes that these powerful drugs are being used to treat neuropsychological behavioural disorders such as depression and anxiety and that the number of children and teens being referred to psychiatric and specialty care is also on the rise. HS profiles the case of a 10-year-old girl who was exposed to a traumatic incident during an overseas trip when the family’s residence was burgled while she slept. According to the child’s mother, the trauma left the child in a state of fear and induced difficulty sleeping. The girl, now 13, was then subjected to bullying at school when she became withdrawn. The mother described how her daughter was immediately prescribed with anti-psychotic medication, quetiapine and risperidone, because of a 12-month waiting list to see a psychotherapist. According to the mother, denying the medication would have resulted in care officials notifying child welfare authorities. Leena Repokaari, head of paediatric psychiatry at the Helsinki University Hospital Hyks, said that what happened is not normal procedure. ""Patients are treated on the basis of an understanding with them and their parents and denying medication alone cannot be grounds for a child welfare complaint."" According to HS, over the past 10 years, the use of medication used to treat Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) has surged in the Helsinki region as well as the entire country. Patients usually begin treatment between the ages of 7 and 10 and more boys than girls are prescribed the drugs. Medical professionals are also prescribing anti-psychotic and antidepressant medication to children and young adults more often. As children, more boys than girls receive anti-psychotic prescriptions, but usage of the drug increases significantly among both groups after the age of 13. Anti-psychotics are usually not recommended for these groups and many medications warn against their use in under 18-year-olds. Meanwhile tabloid daily Iltalehti looks at another issue affecting children. The paper’s online edition picks up the case of a 23-year-old asylum seeker man who was freed of rape charges for sexually assaulting a 10-year-old girl. A Pirkanmaa court did slap the accused with a three-year prison sentence for sexual abuse of the child which took place back in 2016, and an appeal court upheld the sentence. The case generated outrage when the lower court ruled that there was insufficient evidence that the child resisted the man’s advances. Meanwhile the appeal court also found that the victim was not powerless in the situation, and defined powerless as resulting from illness, a disability or a narcotic substance. IL writes that Criminal and Procedural Law Professor Matti Tolvanen challenged the courts' rulings, saying that the law does not consider the victim’s age and stage of development in evaluating powerlessness. Tolvanen noted that current laws define 16 as the age below which the rape of an under-18-year old is considered an aggravated offence, but does not consider the child’s age and level of development in determining how far the victim is capable of resisting sexual violence. He also referenced research showing that children aged 6 – 8 do not yet understand the nature of a sexual act. According to IL, as far as current legislation is concerned, a rape verdict requires violence or the threat of violence and this also applies to offences involving children. The paper notes that cases of sexual violence targeting children rarely result in a rape conviction, but mostly meet the criteria for sexual abuse or aggravated sexual abuse. Families are also in focus in the online edition of another tabloid, Ilta-Sanomat on Thursday. The paper runs a report on a spirited online discussion on the merits – and demerits – of a proposal by the national benefits agency Kela to change the name of Finland’s celebrated baby box. On Tuesday, the organisation invited suggestions from members of the public for the new moniker. In soliciting proposals, it posed the question, ""Does the name of the maternity kit discriminate against dads?"", although it stressed that it was not necessarily aiming for gender-neutrality, rather a more inclusive title. IS provided a summary of reader submissions and opinions on the issue, with the majority of comments dismissing the campaign as a waste of time and calling on the organisation to focus on more important matters. Others thought that perhaps it was time for a change, with many proposing ""baby kit"" or ""family pack"" as likely candidates. Inevitably some readers had a lighter take on the ideas put forward. ""If we want equality, in addition to dad kit, we should add 'accident kit' for those [babies] that arrive by accident,"" quipped one witty reader. ""How about the 'consequences of sex kit',"" came another rejoinder. ""Let’s put 'mustard machine kit' so Kela won’t have to continue with this,"" came one scatological comment. One deep thinker however, was of the view that the name ""family pack"" wouldn’t necessarily be an appropriate label. ""What do you mean 'family kit': Not all [expectant] mothers even have a family before the baby is born."""
15.1.2019,"Tuesday's papers: Finland's sexual abuse statistics, human rights talk in China",https://yle.fi/uutiset/10596457,"Finland's news media all carry distressing statistics this Tuesday, following police reports of aggravated sexual offenses allegedly committed by asylum seekers and recent migrants against minors in Oulu. Amid growing concern, daily Helsingin Sanomat publishes detailed figures from the National Police Board and Statistics Finland that show an increase in sexual attacks against minors since the year 2000. The number of cases reported that year was some 500, compared to nearly 1,700 in the worst year of 2011, many years before the steep rise in immigration. HS writes that the number of sexual offenses against minors grew last year, from some 1,200 to 1,400 reported cases. The severity of the charges has also risen; in 2000 some 15 percent of all sexual assault cases against minors were considered aggravated, whereas last year about a third of cases were prosecuted as aggravated. The majority of the perpetrators in all cases of sexual assault and rape that took place in Finland were Finnish natives, according to the paper. However, last year one-fifth of suspected perpetrators in cases against minors were foreign citizens and about one-third of suspects in all cases of rape were non-Finnish, according to HS. Police figures show that foreign suspects in cases of child abuse in Finland hailed mainly from Iraq, Afghanistan, Estonia and Iran. A large proportion of asylum seekers from Iraq and Afghanistan are young men, and 20-34-year-old people from Iraq were found to have committed 10 times more sexual offenses of some kind in 2017 than Finnish citizens of the same age. Accurate comparisons were not possible on Monday due to a lack of fresh information on the age of asylum seekers. A total of 48 Iraqi citizens were suspected of sexual abuse compared with 801 Finnish citizens in 2018, a HS graph shows. HS cites a Norwegian report that finds people seeking asylum due to crime in their countries of origin are more likely to be involved in crime in the country they move to. Immigrants who arrive because of work, studies or family are equally or even less likely than Finnish-born people to commit illegal acts, the study found. Researcher Martti Lehti from the University of Helsinki says in HS that asylum seekers are the most challenging group of people to help integrate into Finnish society. People seeking asylum are generally fleeing some form of violence or persecution. ""Asylum seekers tend to have less schooling than other groups, leading to a smaller chance of employment,"" Lehti says. ""Slow employment, again, feeds crime."" Meanwhile, tabloid Ilta-Sanomat writes that president Sauli Niinistö, who's on an official visit to China this week, used his time with Chinese president Xi Jinping on Monday to cover numerous issues face to face with China's leader. Among the issues discussed were China's human rights track record and ongoing controversial policy moves. Amid inspections of China's military and reminiscences about the 1952 Helsinki Olympics, Niinistö told IS he got in questions about the dozen or so Canadian nationals being held in custody by Beijing as well as the fate of hundreds of thousands of Muslim Uighurs, who are being actively oppressed and monitored by the Chinese government in the western Xinjiang region according to human rights advocacy groups. Niinistö was tight-lipped about the nature of his conversations with president Xi. ""We talked through all of it. We spoke for about an hour and the subject matter did not upset the host at all,"" Niinistö said. Niinistö also said in IS that he spoke with Xi about the relationship between the three major world powers – the US, China and Russia – and about tensions between North and South Korea. As for the ongoing trade dispute between the US and China, Niinistö's take was brief and non-committal. ""There's some sense of hope in the air, I suppose – at least nothing dark on the economic horizon. But let's not affect the stock market, now,"" Niinistö told the tabloid."
18.12.2012,Minister: Doctors should report child abuse,http://yle.fi/uutiset/6420747,"The minister says children are hurting
because of slow communication between authorities. According to Guzenina-Richardson, social workers
are confused regarding when they should report their hunches to the police and when such suspicions should be treated as confidential
information.  The move would require a legislative
change that is not drawing support from the Finnish Medical Association, which looks out for medical community interests. Under current law, physicians
are not required to report suspected offences to the police.  ""We should be able to swiftly help a child in distress. Every authority should be able to react,"" said the minister. But Heikki Pälve of the Finnish Medical Association says mandating doctors to
report suspicions directly to law enforcement does not ultimately serve children's interests. ""Parents would stop bringing their children to the
doctor because they would be afraid of being reported to the police. Now
doctors notify social workers who can often help families without involving the
police,"" he explained."
18.8.2011,Decline seen in childhood sexual abuse,http://yle.fi/uutiset/5408622,"Of these 18-23 year-olds, 2.5% related experiences of sexual abuse during childhood, while in older age groups the rate is between 3.7% and 5.1%. The study also found that the women were more likely to have been abused as children than the men. It also found that physical neglect and abuse, emotional neglect and abuse, parental substances abuse, and not growing up with both biological parents are risk factors associated with the likelihood of childhood sexual abuse. The findings are based the responses of 4,561 male and 8,361 female Finnish participants to a questionnaire, as well as questions regarding family structure. Researchers say that the results suggest that there is a real decline in the prevalence of childhood sexual abuse in Finland and it is associated with a simultaneous decline in factors associated with childhood sexual abuse. The study has been published in the international professional journal Child Abuse and Neglect."
1.9.2012,Child psychiatrist: Child abuse is a reality in Finland,http://yle.fi/uutiset/6278717,"Child psychiatrist
Jari Sinkkonen says that the case of the brutal death of an 8 year-old girl at
the hands of her father which recently came to light in Helsinki is not unique.
In an interview with Yle, Sinkkonen said that he knows of several similar cases
that have occurred over the years. ""It was not
all that long ago that a child was rescued at nearly the last minute. There was
a real threat of death. Now the child is doing well."" Sinkkonen says
that everyone should open their eyes to the fact that child abuse is a reality
in Finland. He related one of the more shocking cases he has come across. ""Two
children, 5 and 7, sometimes did not have enough to eat. They wet toilet paper
with lukewarm water and ate that. The children told the authorities and some of
their relatives and now their circumstances are good."" This child
psychiatrist places the burden of responsibility to prevent child abuse on
everyone. He wants to see a change in the culture of non-involvement and not
noticing. Child welfare in
the crossfire In the interview,
Sinkkonen also pointed out child welfare authorities are not infallible, and do
sometimes misevaluate situations. However, they are also stuck in a crossfire. ""They are
under immense pressure not to cause expenses by taking children into custody.
On the other hand there is the goal of preserving and keeping families
together, something that the media has pressed strongly for.""  Sinkkonen noted
that cases have been publicized in which families claim to have been treated
wrongly by unfeeling welfare authorities. ""The other
party hasn't been able to say anything. Many social workers have become
extremely cautious. Then they want to see positive signs and they become overly
optimistic. This is when misevaluations occur,"" says Jari Sinkkonen."
8.11.2011,Child abuse suspects arrested,http://yle.fi/uutiset/5449133,"All the victims are boys, and the youngest at the time of the alleged attacks was 11 years of age. The case refers to tens of cases that are alleged to have taken place between 2004 and 2011. Two cases involve aggravated child sexual abuse. The suspects are between 30 and 40 years old, and they were arrested in Kuopio, Tampere and Oulu. One is still in custody. The preliminary investigation turned up tens of thousands of images and hundreds of video recordings of child pornography. Some of them show violence against children. Police suspect that the accused also distributed pornography online. The case has now been passed to the prosecutor."
12.7.2012,Daily: Sharp increase in suspected child sexual abuse cases,http://yle.fi/uutiset/6214733,"Police say
there has been a significant rise in the number of reports of sexual abuse of
children, according to the daily Helsingin Sanomat.  According
to police data, there were twice as many reports of aggravated sexual crimes
against children during the first six months of this year as there were during
the same period last year. Between January and June this year, police recorded
121 such cases, compared to just 60 last year and 30 in 2010. Since the
beginning of the year, police have received 553 reports of other forms of
sexual abuse against children, the highest number in many years. Police
investing violence and sexual crimes told Helsingin Sanomat that reforms to two
pieces of Finnish legislation are behind the explosion of sexual abuse reports
involving children. In June 2011
legislators amended the criminal code to make sexual intercourse with a person
under the age of 16 an aggravated crime. Before the amendment, anyone found
guilty of having intercourse with a minor would have been sentenced for sexual
abuse of a minor, which is a lighter charge than aggravated sexual abuse. Later on in
December, amendments to child protection legislation came into force,
obligating social and health care workers as well as teachers to contact police
if they suspected that a minor was the victim of sexual crimes. Before the
amendment, it was sufficient to lodge a child protection notice with municipal
welfare officers, who would then handle the case. Police add
that the spike in cases could also be caused by an increase in internet-based
sexual crimes, where perpetrators may target multiple victims. The law
enforcers also believed that people have a lower threshold for reporting suspected
sexual crimes. The data
about sexual abuse of children are based on police statistics, and do not
reflect the number of criminal acts, perpetrators or victims because the method
of recording the crimes varies."
28.1.2010,Convicted Paedophiles Find Work With Children,http://yle.fi/uutiset/5499427,"""We have loopholes in the legislation which the working group is trying to patch,"" says Brax. ""There are also problems with the level of punishment... Punishment for sexual crimes against children is inconsistent and in part too lenient."" In many cases, normal background checks won't turn up a record of paedophilia crimes. The town of Pietarsaari, for example, was shocked this winter by case of a lay preacher who severely sexually abused children in his care. The Finnish Evangelical Lutheran Church, his employer, says that over the past few years they've learned of other cases as well. The Church does require a background check before employment. ""Official criminal records, as they are now, are probably not clear or stringent enough. For example they don't record crimes that were given conditional sentences,"" says Director of Family Services in the Office of the Church Council, Martti Esko. ""I think information about any conviction should be given to an employer."" 
""Less Serious"" Paedophile Convictions Hidden
 At the moment, conditional sentences older than five years won't show up on the criminal records given to potential employers. Neither will charges that only earned a fine. Most convictions for sexual child abuse that don't meet the requirements for aggravated charges are punished with suspended prison sentences. ""We need tighter laws in Finland. The rest of Europe has much stricter rules,"" says Maria Kaisa Aula, the Ombudsman for Children in Finland. ""Among other things they ban paedophiles from certain professions, which we don't do here in Finland."""
28.3.2010,Finnish Catholics React to Paedophilia Scandal,http://yle.fi/uutiset/5535961,"In an interview with YLE on Palm Sunday, the start of Holy Week, Tervaportti urges the media to take a broader outlook now that the Catholic Church has served as a “trailblazer” in the paedophilia controversy. “We in Finland hope that the Catholic Church would not be the only institution to be turned inside-out, and that the involvement of other institutions in similar cases would also be examined.” Tervaportti is also the editor of Fides, the publication of the Catholic Diocese in Finland. The latest edition, which appeared on Friday, focuses on the abuse scandal. Fides includes among its readers Finland’s approximately 10,800 Roman Catholics. 
Superfluous Repetition Criticised
 Tervaportti emphasised in the interview with YLE that in the opinion of the Church, the sexual abuse of children and young people is a horrifying act, which cannot be forgiven on the human level. He also says that it is important to bring the cases out into the public, and to investigate them. However, he thinks that there has been some overreach. “We are talking about less than one percent of all cases of abuse worldwide. Why is no attention paid to the other 99 percent?” He also says that the image put forward in the media that the Pope has been sweeping these matters under the rug is inaccurate. “I belong to a group of Catholics that feels that excessive harping on these matters by the media does not advance anything. It is not good for these victims, and in general, it brings nothing more than unnecessary repetition.” Teravaportti feels that the media has been roped into an effort to hurt the Church. The same applies to the statements given to the media by former and present victims of abuse. “Certainly there can be some good in their motivation, but unfortunately, part of it involves economic benefit. 
“Not All Abuse Is Paedophilia”
 Marko Tervaportti emphasises that the Catholic Church does not have any actual obligation to make any public statements on the matter. He notes that good and trustworthy priests also suffer from the constant attention to the subject. The Catholic Diocese in Finland has not learned of any cases of abuse in this country. Based on his close examination of Vatican statistics, Tervaportti concludes that not all cases of abuse in the church involve paedophilia; the Vatican says that only 10 percent of cases of abuse have targeted children. “Sixty percent of all of these abuse cases are, in the view of the Church, and according to statistics, based more on homosexuality than paedophilia, in the sense that they do not target little children, but young men.”"
28.1.2010,Paedophiles Still Getting Jobs near Children,http://yle.fi/uutiset/5499375,"Recent revelations in the west coast city of Pietersaari, that a Laestadian lay preacher had abused a number of children in recent decades, has sent shock waves through the Finnish Evangelical Lutheran Church. Matti Esko, director of family issues at the Office of the Church Council says that a couple of other cases have come out in recent years in which lay workers have sexually abused children. He notes that background checks do not turn up all cases, as criminal records only reveal convictions involving custodial sentences. At present, criminal records do not reveal past suspended sentences dating back more than five years. This means that some child abusers or paedophiles can slip through the cracks and get jobs in which they are in contact with children. “There would be a need to get tougher in Finland. There are much more severe arrangements in Europe, including bans on entering certain professions."" 
Changes In Store
 A working group at the Ministry of Justice is considering changes to legislation on paedophiles. A paper that is scheduled to come out in March or April is expected to propose tougher measures against adults using the internet to seduce children, as well as the inclusion of crimes of child abuse that have been punished with fines in a person’s official criminal record."
6.1.2011,Child Rapist Gets Six Years,http://yle.fi/uutiset/5302255,"The man sexually abused and raped several underage girls ranging in age from 12 to 16, sometimes drugging them. The defendant’s rape of two young girls in a private home was photographed by two other men who threatened to post the images online. These men were ordered to pay fines of 3,000 and 5,000 euros. The men plan to appeal the ruling. The court is not disclosing the locations of the crimes in an effort to protect the identity of the victims."
19.10.2012,Kidnapping suspect in possession of child pornography,http://yle.fi/uutiset/6342318,"On September 25th, an 8-year-old girl was abducted into a van in the Tavastila area of Kotka. A few hours later, the girl was found physically unharmed about 15 kilometres from her home. The self-confessed suspect has told police that he chose his victim at random without any plan in mind. He bound the girl, took her to a cottage in the Perno area of Kotka and left her there, still bound, while he returned to work. During the day he saw from the media that police were making progress in their search for the child and a van described by witnesses. Despite having her arms taped, the girl was able to use her cell phone to call her mother and the emergency services centre. After finishing work, the suspect was returning home when he saw police nearby and attempted to flee, but apprehended. In addition to questioning the suspect about the abduction, police are also investigating possible charges of attempted child sexual abuse and possession of obscene images of minors. Police seized the man's computer and discovered child pornography which he has admitted to downloading. The computer also has a game that includes sexual violence. The computer's log shows that he last played the game a day before the kidnapping. The man is also suspected of having tried to lure a 9-year-old girl into his vehicle in Kotka in 2009. At the time, he denied the claim and no criminal report was filed."
18.5.2010,Bishops Defend Confidentiality of Confession,http://yle.fi/uutiset/6155830,"Archbishop Leo took the stand that the obligation of priests to maintain the confidentiality of confession should be maintained under all circumstances. He said that discussions on the matter can be held if the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs so wishes, however, he also pointed out that priests already have an obligation to inform officials of cases of possible child abuse. The Bishop of the Lutheran Diocese of Kuopio Wille Riekkinen also defended the traditional secrecy of confession. The same position was recently taken by Lutheran Archbishop Emeritus Jukka Paarma who told the Finnish News Agency STT on Saturday that breaking the confidentiality of confession would not necessarily help investigations into paedophilia. Riekkinen says that such a move would radically change the work and the character of the Church. Basic Services Minister Paula Risikko told the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat on Saturday that when changes were being made to child welfare legislation, the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland was given time to makes its own change to canon law to allow for exposing paedophilia. However, changes were not made then, and according to Risikko, if the Church does not make alterations itself, it will be done by the State within the framework of laws on child welfare. Bishop Riekkinen told Savon Sanomat that the Minister's remark had ""perplexing features"" and that it would be good to know who she meant when she referred to the Church. ""At least the present bishops were not part of that conversation,"" he stated."
4.5.2010,Working Group Calls for Harsher Sentences for Child Molesters,http://yle.fi/uutiset/5556383,"For example, the group wants individuals convicted of sexually abusing a child to serve at least four months in jail. Currently the minimum sentence is 14 days. Furthermore, the proposal calls for persons found guilty of having sex with a child under 16 to be convicted of aggravated sexual abuse of a child. Possession of child pornography would also hold tougher sentences. The working group is proposing a new penal provision for persons who groom children for sexual acts with the help of the internet or mobile phones. Those found guilty could get a fine or at most a year in prison. Officials also want more thorough criminal background checks of people working with children."
15.3.2007,Courts: Male Circumcision is Not Child Abuse,http://yle.fi/uutiset/5778346,"The case centred on child abuse charges that were brought against a local woman who had her son circumcised. The Turku court's ruling sets a precedent in Finland, since local attitudes to circumcision vary across the country. Some public hospital will perform religious circumcision, but many others refuse on both financial and moral grounds. In the Helsinki and Uusimaa hospital district, for example, male circumcisions are not performed at all, even though the capital city region has the country's highest concentration of Jews and Muslims. ""Our queues for surgery are so long, that performing ritual surgeries would make it more difficult for patients with medical needs to get the operations they need,"" says Helsinki paediatric surgeon Risto Rintala. The Ministry of Health and Social services has been trying to push through legislation to allow male circumcision in public hospitals. Around 200 Jewish and Muslims baby boys are circumcised each year in Finland. Female circumcision is illegal."
12.6.2007,Lack of Organization Impedes Child Abuse Prevention,http://yle.fi/uutiset/5790641,"The survey of 23 officials and 15 organizations dedicated to child abuse prevention showed the need for better planning on a larger scale. State agencies and non-governmental organisations often work autonomously, overlapping work and without much of an idea of what other agencies are doing. To improve cooperation among the organisations, the report calls for a central organisation to act as a source of information, informing on best practices, and coordinating projects on the local level. An action plan tailored to the needs of children and teens is also desired. Violence prevention in Finland has typically focused on adults and abuse in general. Many seminars and conferences have been organized, but few dealt specifically with the issue of violence against children. Child protection services often end abruptly once a child is no longer in immediate danger. No single authority takes responsibility over long-term supervision. According to the survey, government agencies are often squeezed by time constraints, while child welfare organizations would like to stand on firmer financial ground. 
Easier to Report Child Abuse For those working in the field, non-disclosure and confidentiality clauses have caused confusion, which has resulted in poor communication among the involved parties. The new law on child protection promises clarity on rules, while making it easier to report child abuse. Typically, children are unaware of their rights, while there is too little information on the occurrence of child abuse. The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child is also not well known in Finland. YLE"

He has worked as a chairman for the Laestadian movement in southern Finland. A young male relative of the defendant will also be charged by the prosecution. Police investigated two other men in connection with the case who have since been freed of suspicion. In a separate scandal dating to 2009, allegations were made that a now-deceased Laestadian preacher had abused children in the 1970s and 1980s."
4.5.2010,Church Synod Grapples with Paedophilia Suspicions,http://yle.fi/uutiset/5556353,"The Synod had a number of topics on the agenda including the blessing of homosexual couples, the role of godparents and employee wages. But paedophilia cases that have recently come to light were a particularly distressing subject. However, church leaders say that they are pleased with the openness of discussions so far. ”It is important to discuss these difficult matters. It gives victims a chance to come forward and get through this,” says Pentti Huovinen, a representative from Turku. Still, the suspected crimes come as a shock to many. Pertti Rajala, a church representative, admits he was surprised by the high number of victims. “Perhaps there was a desire to be more optimistic in this matter,” he says. According to some estimates, up to 100 people were victims of paedophilia within the church in recent decades. However, Archbishop Jukka Paarma contends there were only around 20 cases since the 1940s that actually involved clergy or church workers. ”These were not systematic crimes of the institution. These were disturbed individuals acting improperly –crimes that cannot be approved under any circumstances,” says Paarma. The recent furor in the Roman Catholic Church over paedophilia has helped bring the cases in Finland’s Lutheran Church to light. Paarma says victims have had difficulties discussing what happened. Many of the crimes occurred decades ago. ”We have tried to take an open and direct approach. The cases are being made public and we are going through them. If a crime has been committed, it will be handled appropriately.” Paarma adds that open discussions could be beneficial for others as well. However, he was somewhat evasive when asked if church officials found guilty of paedophilia should be fired. ”Cases need to be reviewed individually. Only then can we begin disciplinary action. There will certainly be punishments,” says Paarma. However, church representative Antero Aarnio says anyone guilty of paedophilia should not be allowed to work for the church. ""That would clearly be a breach of official conduct."""
26.6.2013,Justice Minister: No sex offender registry needed,http://yle.fi/uutiset/6704706,"For three years, the Facebook page ""Ei
hyssyttelyä pedofiileille"" (No coddling pedophiles) published the photos
of and personal information about people condemned by Finnish courts for
sexual offenses against minors. Facebook deleted the account on the 19th of
June. The page was maintained by a group calling itself
""Finnish Pedohunters"". As soon as the Facebook account was closed,
another with the same purpose and content was set up. The actions of the group have come under criticism for
endangering the privacy of the victims of sex crimes. Publication of personal
information about the offenders can make it easy to identify victims. The group maintaining the Facebook page has countered
that the law is not tough enough on the sexual exploitation of minors and so
they are entitled to publish information about offenders The Ministry of Justice is currently drafting
revisions of rape laws. Justice Minister Anna-Maja Henriksson says that they will
include stiffer sentences for sex crimes targeting children. The bill is to be introduced
to Parliament this coming autumn.  The Finnish Pedohunters group has launched on online
legislative initiative calling for the establishment of an American-style sex
offender registry.  Justice Minister Henriksson says she sees no reason to
set up a public registry. She, as well, has been critical of the ""No
coddling pedophiles"" Facebook page. ""I find it problematic that private individuals
start their own registries of criminal offenders. This is a matter that now
must be given some attention,"" Henriksson told Yle.  The police have received a formal complaint calling
for an investigation into the activities of the Finnish Pedohunters group. The
group's application to be registered as an official organization has not yet
been approved. Registry authorities say that the application contains several
points that do not fulfill public association registry requirements."
4.12.2005,Supervision Prevents Repeat of Child Abuse,http://yle.fi/uutiset/5220939,"Following the conclusions of recent international studies, authorities in Helsinki closely followed the progress of a hundred children who had been abused. After three years, only one child suffered a repeat of the crime. Police say it's the watchful eye of the authorities that have reduced the number of repeat offences. ""If the authorities hadn't gotten involved, the fate of these children would be much worse. International studies show that if we don't get involved, the abuse continues and becomes more brutal,"" says Kari Tolvanen, the head of the Helsinki Police's Department of Violent Crime. Typical injuries to babies are unexplained bone or skull fractures, burns and bruises in strange places. In the past few years, police have been alerted to a few cases of intentional infant poisoning. Usually social workers or health care professionals become suspicious when the explanations given can't quite explain the type of injury. This year authorities have been alerted to 150 suspected cases of child abuse - 40 more than last year."
16.2.2006,Police Hearing of More Child Abuse,http://yle.fi/uutiset/5222926,"According to the newspaper Keskisuomalainen, police say that 150 child abuse victims under the age of 6 were reported last year. The year before, the number was just 100. Police say the increase is likely due to earlier reporting of violence, not necessarily an upswing in the number of incidents. The perpetrators are generally the child's parents and most often the parents are intoxicated when the abuse occurs. Among the more common effects of abuse seen are broken bones and cigarette burns. In addition, there are cases of ""chemical abuse"", that is, forcing young children to consume alcohol, medications are drugs. One form of potential dangerous abuse, shaking small children, is on the decrease in the Helsinki region. Police attribute this to better information on the dangers of the practice. Most reports of child abuse are filed in the capital area, although violence against children is not limited to major urban centres. While some localities had no reports at all last year, police believe that this probably only shows that either people don't know how, or are unwilling to file reports."
20.6.2006,Reports of Child Abuse Double,http://yle.fi/uutiset/5226525,"The higher figure of the sexual abuse of children became apparent in the Research Institute's annual criminal report for 2005. In addition to a possible rise in the actual number of crimes committed, the National Research Institute of Legal Policy says that the high figure is also due to the fact that nowadays people are more likely to contact police if they suspect something. A few years ago, the National Research and Development Centre for Welfare and Health issued public recommendations to urge the public to speak up if they suspect child abuse. Most instances of sexual abuse of children happen within the family, and the abuser in most cases is the father."
7.6.2006,Campaign to Tackle Child Abuse,http://yle.fi/uutiset/5226125,"Statistics show that Finland is still Western Europe's most violent country when it comes to domestic violence. And children are the most vulnerable to it. To address the problem, police and child welfare authorities are focusing on a broad awareness and enforcement campaign. Half of the campaign is to prevent child abuse from ever happening. This involves distributing information at pre- and post-natal clinics on the dangers of shaking infants. A similar campaign in the United States helped cut the casualty rate of shaken baby syndrome in half. Simultaneously, professionals dealing with children are being continuously taught how to spot potential cases of abuse. For infants, at least, the guidelines are crystal clear: bruises should not appear on children under one year of age. Suspicion should also be aroused if a child under the age of five suffers from broken ribs, shoulder blades or upper arms. Something like falling off a changing table could not cause these types of breaks. Child welfare authorities are also being urged to be vigilant. Too many are still reluctant to notify authorities if they suspect abuse. Some feel it conflicts with their responsibility for professional confidentiality. This is a claim that interior ministry police inspector Robin Lardot denies, although he does admit that they are open to interpretation."
10.4.2005,Surge in Reports of Child Abuse,http://yle.fi/uutiset/5215575,"Not all children are safe even with their parents. Of the 111 cases of suspected physical abuse of small children investigated by police, most involved parents. And not all forms of abuse involve direct physical violence. There were also cases of children being drugged, most likely to quiet them or get them to sleep. Still, Helsinki police say that unfortunately many cases of the serious physical abuse of infants and small children either go unnoticed or unreported. They believe that last year's rise in the number of reports and follow-up investigations is a sign of a greater willingness to recognize the problem, not necessarily an upswing in abuse. It is a problem though, almost everywhere. International statistics indicate that at least a quarter of all fractures sustained by children under the age of three are the result of abuse. Some officials here are calling for the statute of limitations on the physical abuse of children to be extended. Their reasoning is that like sexual abuse, physical violence can cause life-long damage, and its victims should be able to bring their abusers to justice -- even as adults years later."

The prosecutors are demanding the maximum prison sentence. Child abuse carries a maximum four years' prison sentence, but prosecutors believe that if convicted, the defendant could serve many more years because of the frequency of his alleged crimes. All of the alleged victims were teenage girls in his classes. 12 girls have brought charges, while many others decided not to go to court. The defendant has by and large denied the charges, saying the sexual contact was consensual."

The nightmare which struck the small town of 8 300 people in the Tampere region seems to be easing a bit. On Monday the Tampere police took charge and spke to the media in order to set the record straight on some of the wilder rumours. The numbers of children involved has not been stated, but police say thay are looking at fewer than local officials thought. They are talking of individual cases of sexual assault rather than ""group"" abuse. Over the weekend, the local director of social services had said more than 10 girls, elementary and middle-school pupils between the ages of 12 and 15 had have been the victims of sexual abuse by adult males with links to drugs and Satan worship. And now, although police do not rule this out, they say there are no indications of either drugs or cults. The director of social services has has withdrawn from public view.

6.4.2008,Call to Ban Child Abusers from Working with Kids,http://yle.fi/uutiset/5829815,"
Finland's Legal Register Centre has proposed that persons convicted of sexually abusing children be banned from working with children in the future, reports the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat. The ban could be temporary or permanent, depending on the severity of the crime. It would also apply to volunteer work and short-term jobs. Currently individuals seeking to work with children are required to hand over criminal records. However, employers are allowed to hire persons who have a criminal background. Furthermore, criminal records are not required for jobs lasting less than three months or for volunteer work. The Legal Register Centre maintains Finland's criminal registry, and provides around 60,000 criminal records annually. The centre would have to process even more record requests if background checks for individuals seeking short-term and volunteer work are required. Finland's Ombudsman for Children Maria Kaisa Aula is in favour of clearer guidelines for checking backgrounds on persons working with children. She also supports disclosing the backgrounds of volunteers and those working with children for short periods of time. Helsingin Sanomat, YLE"
19.11.2008,Abuse Cases Silenced in Religious Communities,http://yle.fi/uutiset/6120826,"Church groups are now trying to come up with ways to handle abuse cases. For example, Pentecostal groups in Finland are drawing up plans on how to deal with abusers within the community and whether they can continue in their jobs. One recent case involves an adult member of the Finnish Pentecostals. He said a youth worker sexually abused him as a child and several other boys for years. At the time of the abuse, the victim was told he brought it on himself. He is now trying to settle the issue within the Pentecostal community. Although the abuser in question has admitted to the act, he moved on to become a pastor. Pentecostal elders said the pastor had made his peace with God. However the elders questioned the victim's faith. ""The surfacing cases are the tip of the iceberg. Religions often adhere to the belief that everything must be forgiven,"" elaborates Muhonen. 
Tradition of Silence
 The Pentecostals congregations have been particularly adamant about silencing abuse cases. Parishes have even let convicted abusers continue their work. ""As a preacher, I know that God forgives. If you confess your sins, you are forgiven,"" said Tapio Sopanen, a preacher and chair of the Helluntaiseurakuntien Julistjat ry, a Pentecostal workers' association. ""The question is, can confidence be restored to this preacher,"" he said. Under Finnish law, employers must carry out a criminal background check on employees who permanently work with children. Child protection laws also call for persons to report suspected abuse cases to police or child protection services. However ministers and other pastoral counsellors are bound by confidentiality rules. For example in the Finnish Evangelical Church, confessions are strictly confidential."

The prosecutor says that all but one the charges relate to offences committed in Thailand. In addition, the district prosecutor is demanding a conviction for the possession and distribution of child pornography. Police detained the suspect in January upon his return from Thailand. A house search uncovered a diary of journeys to Thailand. The defendant has no previous convictions. Aggravated child abuse carries a maximum ten year prison sentence in Finland.

In one case, a man from Kuopio has been sentenced to two years imprisonment for aggravated sexual assaults on a child. This came after the regional court in Eastern Finland released the man from custody, having judged that the charges against him were out of date. In two other cases, the Supreme Court set legal precedents in cases of child sex abuse. In one of the two cases, a sentence by a court in Vaasa was reduced. In the other case, the Supreme Court reduced a sentence to gross indecency from an original charge of aggravated indecency against a child.

6.11.2005,Shaking Babies More Common Than Thought,http://yle.fi/uutiset/5220181,"Shaken baby syndrome describes the serious injuries that can occur when an infant or toddler is severely or violently shaken. These children, especially babies, have very weak neck muscles and do not yet have full support for their heavy heads. Shaking babies hard can cause serious injuries. Shaken baby syndrome usually occurs when a parent or other caregiver shakes a baby because of anger or frustration, often because the baby would not stop crying. International studies indicate that one in four babies suffering from shaken baby syndrome die. No studies on the subject exist in Finland. Finnish experts have estimated on the basis of international studies that about two babies in Finland are life-threateningly shaken every month. Nowadays, police are more and more apt at investigating cases of suspected child abuse. Often parents have defended their actions by saying that they were not aware how dangerous shaking was to the baby. Finnish healthcare centres have launched a campaign to raise parents' awareness of shaken baby syndrome."
16.5.2006,Improvements Sought to Child Protection Law,http://yle.fi/uutiset/5225463,"The working group tasked with improving the law wants more adults to be required to inform police if child abuse is suspected. This would apply to youth group leaders, for example, and would take precedence over their professional obligation of secrecy. The group also wants authorities to wrap up all case investigations in a maximum of three months. Currently, this time limit applies only to urgent cases. Officials hope that a quicker response to cases of suspected child abuse will decrease the number of children taken into custody. Should welfare authorities have to take custody, the working group wants them to first determine whether a family member could take the child instead."
22.1.2008,Mandatory Treatment Planned for Paedophiles,http://yle.fi/uutiset/5820184,"
Finland's Ministry of Justice is looking at plans to mandate chemical treatment for offenders convicted of sexually abusing children. The Ministry has also started a review of the variation in sentences handed down to paedophiles in different courts. Large segments of the public have been outraged by the suspended sentences given out in recent cases of long-term serious sexual abuse of children. The Ministry of Justice is now making plans to mandate paedophiles to undergo medical treatment - what is known as ""chemical castration"" - the use of medications that sharply reduce or eliminate sexual urges. Officials say that this could probably be implemented under the present system of criminal offender supervision. The chief of the Ministry's Department of Criminal Policy, Jarmo Littunen, told YLE that new medications are both effective and have few side effects. Internationally, there is a body of data claiming success for the chemical treatment of paedophiles. In Denmark, it has been seen that chemical treatments have been effective, at least in the cases of paedophiles who want to avoid repeating their offences. Kauko Aromaa, Director of the European Institute for Crime Prevention and Control, told YLE, ""If on the other hand, this person sees nothing wrong in his own behaviour, as is often the case with child abusers, then apparently mere medical treatment has limited or no effect."" Ministry reviewing sentences Aromaa also points out judges do not have the education, and rarely the experience, to fully understand the effects of abuse on the child. For this reason, some offenders who are in need of treatment get off with light sentences. The Justice Ministry has now ordered a review of the details of child abuse cases that have been sealed by the courts. A year's cases and the sentences imposed are being analyzed to provide judges with an overview that can be used as a guideline for future sentencing. The Finnish Police College has begun collecting information on the experiences of the potential victims of paedophiles. This week and next, the College is distributing questionnaires to the nation's schools in an effort to determine how common child abuse really is.

4.4.2008,Battered Babies on the Increase,http://yle.fi/uutiset/5829696,"
More and more infants are turning up at hospitals with injuries that authorities suspect are caused by violence. According to research published in the Finnish Medical Journal, enquiries into cases of suspected infant abuse in south western Finland have nearly tripled over the last few years.
 Researchers at the Turku University Hospital have said that the higher statistics are due in part to a more systematic program of investigation. However they point out that actual abuse cases have also increased. Cases of suspected child abuse most often involved a father or step-father, however when there was no clear information about the abuser, the affected children were most often in their mothers' care. The Child Welfare authorities were notified in all cases. In Turku, all infants under the age of one year, who present with serious injuries or unusual bruising, are routinely examined for suspected abuse. Researchers want to see the age limit for such routine abuse examinations increased to two years. They add that when infants suffer from broken bones, bumps or bruises, they are usually the result of physical violence."
27.3.2008,Increasing Number of Cases Land at Child Welfare Office,http://yle.fi/uutiset/5829049,"
Abuse cases reported to child welfare services are on the rise. Across the country, drug and alcohol problems are the main reason chid protection services are contacted.
 Turku University Hospital alone reports over 100 cases of abuse annually. Since the beginning of the year, child services have been notified of 700 different cases in Turku. Essi Vahala from the Children's Clinic at Turku University Hospital says the clinic reports abuse cases to child welfare services every week. Tarja Salonius, from the Turku Social Welfare Office, says the relatively large number of cases in Turku doesn't necessarily mean the city's families have more problems, but rather that there's more awareness on child welfare. The new Child Welfare Act, which came into force this year, may be behind the increased number of reported cases. The enforcement of the Act does however not explain this worrying trend entirely. Vahala for instance says that the use of drugs and alcohol has not only increased among parents, but also among children. In addition to a higher number of reported child abuse cases in Turku, Tampere and Pori have also seen a surge in incidents. By the time child services are contacted, the situation has often reached a very grave state. Social workers are now calling for more preventive measures to protect Finland's children and at-risk families."

However, they don't believe this means that the actual number incidents has increased, only that more cases are being reported. This is due to new laws which require social and health workers to report all suspicions of paedophilia. The number of cases rose the most in Lapland: by 131 percent."
31.3.2009,Move to Criminalise Grooming In Finland,http://yle.fi/uutiset/5738573,"Currently, child sex abuse and attempts of such abuse are illegal in Finland, but no laws have been passed to criminalise grooming. Proposed anti-grooming legislation could make perpetrators face charges for contacting and gaining the trust of their victims. Chief Inspector Kari Tolvanen says he welcomes such a law but says it’s not crucial. ”Finnish laws are quite good at the moment. The law currently allows us to intervene in cases early on; however, the new law wouldn’t hurt. If the new law can save a few children from becoming exploited, then it has filled its purpose,” says Tolvanen. Last week, Helsinki police uncovered a series of sex crimes involving 66 under-aged victims. Three middle-aged men living in the Helsinki region are under suspicion. In some of the cases the suspects and victims met over the Internet. Other cases involve physical contact between the perpetrator and child.

4.3.2008,Demonstration Against Internet Censorship,http://yle.fi/uutiset/5826087,"
A demonstration against preventative Internet censorship was held in downtown Helsinki on Tuesday. Demonstrators protested a National Bureau of Investigation list aimed primarily at blocking access to child pornography websites.
 The demonstration was organised by a network of citizens opposed to a law, in force since last year, allowing police to recommend to Internet operators to block access to websites containing child pornography. Compliance with the recommendation is voluntary. Protestors are concerned that other types of sites will be included on the police list and argue that present filtering does not prevent child abuse or the spread of child pornography. The groups behind the demonstration say that the law gives police authorities unreasonable powers that they should not have without court supervision. They also say that as the lists are not published, the secrecy of the censorship process is also contrary to the ideal of government transparency. Demonstrators called for an end to the filtering of Internet traffic, and in its place, concrete measures by police to close down websites containing child pornography. Organizers claim that the police have abused their authority by censoring sites that do not contain child pornography, including a Finnish site criticizing this specific implementation of censorship. The National Bureau of Investigation has conceded that some sites that do not contain child pornography may have been put on the block list. The most recent debate around the issues of child pornography and freedom of speech has also aroused concern at the Ministry of Communications. Last month Communications Minister Suvi Lindén set up a working group to look at how children and teens can be shielded from harmful content on the Internet and in other electronic media. YLE"

Drugs geared towards sex offenders are now considered to be more effective than before and also carry fewer side effects. The working group has until the end of November to make a recommendation.

29.5.2020,No rise in child welfare reports after schools re-open,https://yle.fi/uutiset/11376025,"The number of child welfare reports filed with child protection authorities did not increase when schools re-opened following about two months of distance learning, according to an Yle investigation. Officials had previously expressed concern that a decline in welfare reports during the spring when children were learning at home meant that cases of neglect or abuse might have been overlooked. They speculated at the time that the reduced number of reports was due to the fact that in many cases, reports are filed by school or daycare officials. But according to Yle’s review of data there has so far been no increase in reports during the last two weeks of the school year when pupils returned to class. Yle checked social workers’ figures on child welfare reports in large cities such as Helsinki, Espoo, Vantaa, Turku, Tampere and Oulu. Only Tampere showed no change in reports during the pandemic. However in the other large cities, the data showed a sharp fall in the number of complaints at the start of the partial state of emergency, when schools closed to help curb the spread of coronavirus. In Turku, for example, the number of child welfare reports fell by 25 percent in April compared to the same time last year, while the corresponding amount in Espoo was more than 30 percent. After the initial steep drop, the number of notifications began to climb slowly, but in many cities it is still at their usual low level. Helsinki child welfare social work head Jonna Vanhanen said that during May there was an exceptionally low number of reports about children in distress. She noted that typically, reports begin to rise in May as the academic year comes to an end. ""Since the beginning of the state of emergency, there have been few child welfare complaints compared to the past. When school starts there are usually somewhat more [reports] compared to the beginning of May, for example, but the difference is considerable compared to last year,"" she added. In Helsinki, the reduced number of notifications are visible, especially in reports concerning violence towards children, children’s psychological problems, substance abuse and offences committed by minors. Authorities believe that a lower number of child welfare reports is bad news because it suggests that problems have gone underground. In recent years, the trend has been for such complaints to grow steadily from year to year. ""This is a worrying phenomenon. Apparently we now have a lot of invisible distress that is not coming to anyone’s attention,"" Children’s Ombudsman Elina Pakkarinen said. She pointed out that in addition to distance learning, the lives of children and teens had also been affected by a lack of other services and adult contact. Counselling visits had fallen and youth outreach work could no longer take place face to face. ""On top of that many children may have parents with substance abuse or mental health problems. If they don’t use [social] services, their children’s distress and need for support will not be visible,"" she added. Hanna Heinonen, chief executive of the Central Union for Child Welfare, said that she was worried about whether or not children in need of assistance and support had been overlooked during the spring when kids were not at school. ""The coronavirus situation has especially affected families that struggled with everyday life, even before the state of emergency. There’s a concern whether or not this has created a pent-up need for services,"" Heinonen said. For schools, a child welfare report is a last resort for addressing children’s problems. As a result, the real need for child protection services is usually only known after school vacations. ""It’s foreseeable that after the holiday there will be a situation where many children and families will need support to deal with everyday life,"" Heinonen said. Officials in Vantaa are preparing for a larger than usual demand for youth support services in particular during the summer, according to family services director Anna Cantell-Forsbom. The number of child welfare notifications in Vantaa, fell markedly to a lower-than-normal level when schools closed because of the crisis, but rebounded to closer to the levels seen last year during April. ""During the coronavirus situation Vantaa’s social and crisis unit has recorded cases of family violence and increased alcohol consumption by parents and this has resulted in more emergency visits than usual,"" Cantell-Forsbom added. According to Children’s Ombudsman Pakkarinen now is the time to focus on offering assistance as early as possible so that family problems do not escalate. ""We should especially place emphasis on vulnerable children and young people and make sure that their need for support does not become so great that they have to turn to child protection services, for example,"" she declared. Politicians have also expressed concern over the impact of the crisis on children. Government is expected to include a support package for children and young adults in its supplemental budget next week. The funding will aim to address any disadvantages caused by the long period of distance learning. The Ministry of Social Affairs and Health has also created a working group charged with strengthening children’s rights and to support after-care for children and families following the crisis. The working group is due to wrap up its work at the end of October."

Intensified monitoring of the internet by The National Bureau of Investigation is to continue until the end of this month. Police have followed up hundreds of leads relating to threats despite the lack of additional resources.
 Police have kept a watchful eye on the internet for almost a month since the Kauhajoki shooting. They have examined hate and racist sites in addition to searching for suspicious profiles. Tip offs from other police officers, webmasters and internet users have also greatly assisted their investigations. All tip offs relating to threats on individuals or crime have been followed up but police describe the job of searching for deranged individuals as looking for a needle in a haystack. In addition to two fulltime officers to oversee the internet investigations, five other policemen have been brought in. However, no extra police have been recruited. A decision will be made at the end of the month whether to continue the current level of investigations. Interior Minister Anne Holmlund believes the investigation must continue and has promised additional financial and human resources for the police next year. For their part, police say the current intensified internet operation is affecting other investigations such as tracing pedophiles. A dedicated internet investigation unit would be most welcome, they say. So far, though, no decision has been made by the Interior Ministry. YLE"

Investigators believe that there may be more victims of the man known as ""Eno"" or Uncle, and have released an image of the suspect with a request for further victims and witnesses to come forward. The police justify their decision to publish the suspect's photograph on the grounds that it is necessary in order to carry out a full investigation into the man's possible crimes.  Although he is only suspected of the crimes at this stage, public broadcaster Yle is also publishing the image of the man, due to these exceptional circumstances.  Director of the investigation Saara Asmundela of the Helsinki Police Department said that the identity of at least one of the suspected victims has not yet been established. ""It may be that some of the victims are not even aware that they were abused because many of the victims known to the police were in an unconscious state at the time the suspected offences occurred. This was due to the suspect supplying the victims with alcohol or other intoxicants,"" she said.  The man is suspected of, among other things, multiple cases of aggravated rape and aggravated sexual abuse of a child. The offences are believed to have occurred at the man's apartment in the Helsinki neighbourhood of Laajasalo, beginning in 2006 and continuing over the course of several years.  According to police, the suspect is known as ""Eno"" by the young people in his local community. During their preliminary investigation, police have discovered that the suspect had also been known to offer alcohol and narcotic drugs to minors.  Police have emphasised that they believe a number of serious crimes have transpired, and that the evidence provided by both victims and witnesses will play an important role in determining possible charges. ""We ask that anyone who suspects that they have been the victim of a crime or knows something that might be helpful in the investigation to please contact us,"" Asmundela said.

The court also ordered the defendant to pay damages amounting to 1,500 euros to one of the complainants and 1,200 euros each to four others. The court found that the offences occurred between 2013 and 2017. The 43 year-old denied the charges in court and said that when he touched the children he was providing massages and other forms of assistance without any sexual intent. The court ruled that the teacher had sent messages with sexual images and texts to young boys, which prompted a written warning in 2014. However he continued to engage in inappropriate communications with the students in spite of the warning, the court said. The school filed a criminal report about the teacher at the beginning of 2017. The school principal was also charged with dereliction of duty in connection with the teacher's offences. The court will hear the case against the principal in 2019.

In a statement issued on Monday, police said that the new suspect is believed to have committed human trafficking. Only one of the four people suspected in the cases has been remanded into pre-trial custody. The main suspect in the group of alleged offences is cultural luminary Veijo Baltzar. He is suspected of committing several counts of aggravated rape and aggravated human trafficking between 2016 and 2019. The allegations were first reported in November last year. The sexual offences allegedly took place in Helsinki, Kuopio, Rautalampi in northern Savo and Tammisaari, which lies in Raseborg (Raasepori in Finnish) in southwest Finland. Baltzar is also suspected of child sexual abuse, sexual abuse and assault. Police said that they would not comment further on the investigation at this stage and indicated that the deadline for pressing charges is 18 November.  Last November, daily Helsingin Sanomat reported that 77-year-old Baltzar had manipulated, controlled and preyed on girls and young women in his theatre company.  The paper interviewed 18 women and girls who said they had personal experience working with the globally-renowned figure. Many said they felt that in rehearsals they had to please Baltzar if they wanted to gain his approval or land an important role.  The interviewees said that Baltzar lured young women to stay at his home. He was said to have been living in Tammisaari and Rautalampi at the time. HS also reported that he insisted that the girls break with their families and boyfriends.  Baltzar has denied the allegations of aggravated human trafficking. He was remanded into custody last November. At the time, police suspected two other individuals of aggravated human trafficking. Charges were initially to be laid against him in February, but the deadline was first extended until June and later until November as new developments emerged in the case."
22.11.2017,"Wednesday's papers: Rape acquittal, status of Swedish and a transgender baseball star",https://yle.fi/uutiset/9942440,"Several media report on the appeal of a 23-year-old asylum seeker convicted of the sexual abuse of a 10-year-old girl. The man was sentenced to three years in jail for aggravated sexual abuse, but acquitted of rape in a verdict that prompted extensive debate on social media. The court ruled that the man had sex with the girl in a deserted courtyard of an apartment building in Pirkanmaa, and that constituted aggravated sexual abuse, but acquitted him of rape because the court ruled there was not adequate evidence the girl was afraid or helpless. Aamulehti reported on the case on Tuesday with a look at the nuts and bolts of the rape law that underpinned the verdict. That law holds that for a rape conviction to stand either violence or the threat of violence should be used; or the victim should be unable to defend themselves or articulate their rejection of the attacker. Needless to say, the court's view that a 10-year-old did not meet these criteria has raised eyebrows. ""If this situation doesn't have the essential elements of a rape offence, then yes we should consider changing the law,"" said Professor of Criminal Law Matti Tolvanen in comments to Aamulehti that were widely reported in other media. Yle's Finnish-language service reported the appeal court's verdict last Friday. A broad survey on attitudes towards the Swedish language makes the news today, with Helsingin Sanomat reporting that ""The position of Swedish isn't important to the young"". That refers to a finding that just 52 percent of those questioned aged under 30 regarded the position of Swedish in Finnish society as important. That percentage rises to 80 percent among pensioners. The older the respondent, the the stronger the desire to protect the status of Swedish. Good Swedish skills were regarded as important in decision-makers by just 60 percent of respondents, down from 80 percent in the same survet in 2008. Half of respondents said they had no use for Swedish skills, while nearly half of Finnish speakers questioned said that public services in Swedish cost the taxpayer too much money. Iltalehti reports on the first transgender Finnish baseball player to come out in Finland. Alexander Saloranta announced last week that he wants to live as a man. He has five baseball championships to his name, was voted player of the year in 2011 and plays for the Lapua team in a rural part of South Ostrobothnia. The news came as a surprise to those who knew him as Paula, his birth name, but the 30-year-old was now ready to go public. Saloranta says he always knew he wanted to be a boy, even as a small child. His fiance Sari and his parents have been supportive, and even as Paula, Saloranta was one of the few openly LGBT sports stars in Finland. Now his career in the women's leagues is over, as hormones will show in doping tests and result in a ban from playing. He says he won't seek a men's team to play for, but if one asks, he might well give it a try."
16.2.2019,Added funds for elder care and sex crime prevention top supplementary budget proposal,https://yle.fi/uutiset/10649885,"The Finnish Finance Ministry published its first proposal for supplementary allocations to the 2019 budget on Friday, 15 February. Government will first approve or reject the suggested injections of additional money, after which a version of the proposal is expected be presented to Parliament next week. Recent police suspicions of shocking events in the northwest city of Oulu and reports of gross neglect in some privately-run senior care facilities have led to a ministry call for five million more euros to be directed towards the prevention of sex crimes, and an allocation for the hiring of more inspection personnel on the regional and state level to oversee services catering to the elderly, disabled and early childhood education. The added five million euros to prevent sex crimes targeting children and youth includes 1.6 million euros more for online policing and 1.5 million euros for relevant educational work in schools. The ministry proposes an additional 0.3 million euros be granted to youth work, and 800,000 more euros devoted to the launch of a new LASTA model, a new child protection service structure consisting of 18 regional hubs of specialist social service and health care. The new structure aims to provide child friendly investigation and support for all cases of alleged physical or sexual abuse. The ministry would also award 4.8 million euros in added funding to the Finnish Immigration Service (Migri) for immigration-related security measures. The proposal says the additional funding would be used to improve Migri activities and found a new detention facility in Oulu. Among other technical adjustments, the first supplementary budget proposal of 2019 also revises down its tax revenue estimate to reach a figure 196 million euros lower than was originally forecast. In this latest iteration of the Finnish budget for 2019, expenditure estimates increased by 80 million euros, while revenue estimates were reduced by 190 million, meaning that the proposal increases the government's net borrowing requirement by 270 million euros.

4.9.2018,Poll: 30% of Finnish teens report online sexual harassment,https://yle.fi/uutiset/10385837,"A fresh poll commissioned by the Finnish branch of the Save the Children charity has found that over 30 percent of respondents between the ages of 12 and 17 have witnessed some kind of sexual harassment of their peers on digital media in the last year. Results from the 3,210 secondary school pupils that responded to the survey indicated that girls are more often exposed than boys to material they consider to be sexually harassing. Over 10 percent of the girls said that they had personally been the victim of sexual harassment, while this was true for less than 5 percent of the boys. ""I was sent a picture of a boy's genital area on Snapchat. I didn't like it,"" answered one poll respondent. Snapchat, Instagram and WhatsApp are the most popular social media platforms in use in Finland, the survey revealed. The survey suggested that many children don't see a problem sharing suggestive images with their peers. Close to one-third of the young boys and one-fifth of the girls said it is acceptable to share naked images and videos with their boyfriends or girlfriends on the platforms, for example. Among upper secondary students, 50 percent of girls and close to 60 percent of boys are okay with sending such images to someone they are dating. ""My former boyfriend pressured me to send pictures and images of myself naked,"" said one respondent. In addition, 12 percent of secondary school girls and 8 percent of boys admitted to sharing a message with a sexual image or video with someone that they did not interact with offline. Among upper secondary students, this number jumped to 16 percents for girls and 11 percent for boys. ""I've been asked to submit nude images several times. I have stupidly done it, but they didn't spread online – at least not yet,"" one of the respondents revealed. The survey results confirmed that 12 to 17 years-olds tend to say one thing and do another on this issue. When asked if it is okay to share an image of a scantily-dressed or naked person that they have received online, 90 percent of respondents said no. Even so, about one-third of the youth reported having seen this kind of material exchanged among their peers. The report determined that shame is the biggest factor keeping young people from telling the adults in their lives about the sexual harassment or bullying they might have been exposed to online. More than half of girls and over 20 percent of boys said that this was the case. Save the Children Finland said that sharing intimate photos and suggestive messages in social media applications seems to be a natural part of young people's romantic relationships these days. The charity emphasised that the risk that such sensitive material will be used in a detrimental manner must be communicated to young people. It called on Finnish schools and other institutions to engage in more open and direct discussion about the distribution of suggestive images on digital media, and its hazardous consequences. Save the Children also called for Finnish legislation on sex crimes to be updated to include all forms of sexual abuse and harassment affecting children. "
26.7.2019,Police: Reporting of sex offences up 16%,https://yle.fi/uutiset/10895255,"The number of reports of sexual offences increased by more than 16 percent in the first half of 2019, according to a statement issued by Finnish police.  However, police do not believe that more sex crimes are being committed, but rather that more are being reported.  ""It should be noted that these figures refer only to the number of reported crimes and do not therefore indicate whether the number of offenders has increased. In other words, the same offender may be the suspect in more than one case,"" the police press release stated.  The increase has also been attributed to the filing of several reports over a short period of time, for example when a suspect is held on suspicion of committing one crime, but earlier offences are subsequently added to the suspect's charge sheet.  According to the police statistics, the suspect was known to the victim in about 67 percent of the reported sexual offenses.  Furthermore, approximately three quarters of the suspects were Finnish nationals, while just over one quarter were foreign nationals, an increase of about six percent compared with last year. According to Chief of Police Seppo Kolehmainen, the year-on-year difference has been driven by an increased concentration of reporting around specific population groups and in certain regions. In Oulu, the total number of sexual offence reports increased by more than 100 percent in the first half of this year compared to the same period last year, with 205 sexual offences being brought to the attention of the Oulu Police Department from January to June this year.  Of these reports, the number of rapes was almost twice as high as in January to June last year, and the number of reported child sexual abuse cases was 42 percent higher than in the corresponding period of 2018.  However, Oulu is not the only place where the reporting of sex crimes has increased. In the area patrolled by the Western Uusimaa Police Department, the number of sexual offence reports increased by almost 65 percent. There was a particular spike in the reporting of cases involving the sexual exploitation of a child, with 131 reports filed, an increase of almost 105 percent.  The number of rape reports in the region also increased, by almost 29 percent, with 45 separate cases recorded. Elsewhere in Finland, the number of sexual offence reports is similar to last year, or has decreased. Reports to the Eastern Finland Police Department were down by almost 13 percent in January to June this year, with 23 fewer incidents being brought to the police's attention than in the corresponding period last year."
3.10.2019,Foster home in southern Finland shuttered over suspected abuse,https://yle.fi/uutiset/11004086,"Regional authorities in southern Finland have ordered that Pro Manors Ltd terminate activities at its foster care facility known as Loikalan Kartano in the Iitti municipality of the Kymenlaakso region in southern Finland. Officials said they discovered serious shortcomings at the facility, with inappropriate discipline and restraints that were not in accordance with Finland's child welfare laws. The foster home was also understaffed, while personnel were inadequately trained. Regional authorities report that the operations were not fully licensed and did not fulfil the conditions required for the provision of foster care. The shortcomings were discovered on a surprise visit from the Regional State Administrative Agency of Southern Finland in June.  Officials now demand that the home be decommissioned by the beginning of November, and says it will arrange substitute placements for children and youth who are currently living at the facility. Heidi Rauha, director of the foster care facility, said she does not wish to comment on the decision to close the home. ""I am shocked. I find the situation strange in this law-abidingcountry. If the authorities make these kinds of decisions, then they must of course move forward with them,"" she said. Rauha is still contemplating whether she will use her right to appeal the decision. ""We have done a lot of work to fix the operations and we have been waiting for decisions. The process has taken almost a year, in practice. I am not however ready to comment yet today,"" she said. In May, the deputy ombudsman of parliament requested that the regional authorities examine Loikalan Kartano to see if activities complied with permits and operational practices. The request was issued after the ombudsman's office made an inspection of the facility one year ago. This previous inspection discovered that youth were stripped naked and isolated at the facility. The minors placed at Loikalan Kartano at the time were between the ages of 14 and 17. The young people at the foster home told the inspectors that they were asked to undress when they arrived at the facility, and were then cut off from other people in the building. They were not allowed to move about inside their units and had to seek permission to leave their room by knocking on the door from the inside. The minors were also reportedly not allowed to speak during meals. The deputy ombudsman said the decision to have regional authorities inspect the facility was based on the teens' reports, written reports about restraint decisions, staff inspections and records drawn up about the placed minors.  The Southeastern Finland Police Department is investigating the irregularities at Loikalan Kartano, and says it suspects the foster home's management of imprisonment, coercion and assault. The exact nature of the offenses will become clearer as the investigation progresses. The police say they have two main suspects, one of whom is the head of the facility."
22.2.2020,Surge in complaints by children in care,https://yle.fi/uutiset/11223236,"Official complaints made by children cared for by the state increased dramatically last year, new figures show, following a scandal in 2018 which brought to light abusive and criminal practices in some of the country’s homes for looked-after children. The publicity around the cases, in the Finnish towns of Muhos and Iitti, led to an increase in awareness that young people in the care system can file a complaint to Finland’s Parliamentary Ombudsman over suspected mistreatment while they are under state guardianship. The Parliamentary Ombusdman said its office received 63 complaints by under-18s in 2019 and reached 45 decisions, significantly up from just 26 new complaints and seven decisions the year before.  Recurring complaints centred around young people in care institutions being made to strip naked, placed in solitary confinement for long periods, forced to eat in silence or remain indoors.  One complainant said they were not even allowed out to attend a college entrance exam, while another complained of punishments being meted out to everyone if one person broke one of the care-home rules. In total the office said it dealt with 500 complaints concerning young people in state custody last year, many of which were made by the parents or guardian of the child. ”In almost every case where a child contacts us, we find something there that may not be in line with the law,” said deputy ombudsman Maija Sakslin.  In more extreme cases the Parliamentary Ombudsman can report an institution to the police or require compensation be paid to the child.  In one case two children received 4,000 euros in compensation each for having their fundamental rights breached while placed in a foster family. Sakslin said that in many places in Finland children in care receive good care and are well looked after, but says that cases where children’s rights are not observed are ”extremely concerning”.  Over 18,000 children in Finland are cared for outside the home, with around 10,000 in state custody."
12.4.2006,Internet Help for Abused Children,http://yle.fi/uutiset/5224499,"The site includes a questionnaire, information and advice designed so that a child get get the help they need. So far, of some 650 children who have responded to the questions on the web page, 80 percent would appear to be living in unsafe environments. If a child who may be suffering abuse can access the site online, they can answer questions which will assess their own risk and get advice and information on getting help discreetly. At the moment, the children's questionnaire and other in depth-resources are only in Finnish. The Federation of Mother and Child Shelters does have information in English on how to get help and the locations of shelters on their website. Last year the organisation helped over 26,000 victims of domestic violence and abuse, six percent more than in the previous year. Experts suggest that many victims are unaware that they should, or can, seek help for their problems. Many are intimidated by fears that in small communities, news of their problems will spread, or are ashamed and afraid that their social status and image will be affected. Studies indicate that a typical victim of domestic abuse will be a women under 40 years old. Child victims often suffer because parenting skills are inadequate and inconsistent, leading to abusive parental behaviour. Researchers have also found that “boundary setting” is a common flashpoint in families. Many parents also suffer from alcohol problems which harm their children’s welfare. The Internet initiative is also aimed at getting the adult perpetrators of abuse to seek help in controlling their behaviour. Links

29.12.2012,New centres planned for abused children,http://yle.fi/uutiset/6431892,"If funding is forthcoming, the first trial of the centres for abused children will be started in Turku at the beginning of 2014. If it proves to be a successful model after a three-year trial period, plans call for at least five more to be set up in various parts of the country, according to the project's director, Minna Juutilainen of the National Institute for Health and Welfare THL. ""These children's centres will be a public service. The police, judiciary, child welfare authorities and healthcare officials will work together for the good of children who have suffered from violence,"" Juutilainen explains. ""Nowadays, the authorities function separately in this difficult, but socially important task. This endangers the interests of children, their rights as children and legal rights,"" she continues. Funding needed Plans are well advanced, but 600,000 to 800,000 euros are still needed to launch the first trial. In 2011 police received over 6000 reports of violence against minors and nearly 1500 reports of sexual abuse. Senior Constable Miia Rutanen of the Pirkanmaa Police District investigates charges of abuse and violence against children, and she says there is a real need to bring all the authorities involved together. ""Many children suffer from having to tell the same things over and over again in different places. The child thinks that once an adult is told, then they all must know,” Miia Rutanen points out."
5.10.2017,"Thursday's papers: Support centre for the undocumented, teenage violence, first snow?",https://yle.fi/uutiset/9866840,"Helsingin Sanomat runs a piece this Thursday on a new support centre being established in Helsinki, specifically intended to help undocumented asylum seekers feel safe and get by. The location of the centre is not public knowledge, as the administrators fear reprisal from anti-immigration proponents. ""Our focus is on the physical safety of our customers,"" says project chief Kirsi Rantala. ""We are not in the business of hiding people, but undocumented people have the right to visit the centre safely."" The centre is a joint venture between the Finnish Red Cross (SPR), the Helsinki Federation of Evangelical Lutheran Parishes and aid organisation Sininauhaliitto (""Federation of the Blue Cross ""). The centre's runners say in the HS piece that they expect dozens of visitors a day to their secret haven, which is open to all but geared towards supporting undocumented people. Many asylum seekers who arrived in 2015, for instance, will soon face negative asylum decisions and be cast outside of the protection of the state and of reception centres, essentially becoming illegal aliens. The SPR's multicultural programme developer Eva Kuhlefelt says she is most sorry about the scarcity of information that asylum seekers receive. ""Some of them do not know what phase their application is in, how to contact a lawyer or what the Finnish Immigration Service or an Administrative Court is,"" she says in HS. Help and information are available in Arabic and Dari, and visitors also have the chance to wash clothes, attend cultural events and meet others in a safe environment. ""The police know about the centre,"" says parish worker Marita Nummelin, referring to the undocumented status of the centre's customers. ""We respect their work, and they respect ours."" Regional paper Aamulehti's front page piece is on the rising tide of violence among young people in Finland. The article states that violent crimes committed by under 18-year-olds have risen in recent years, making up 10 percent of all assaults in the Pirkanmaa region so far in 2017. Last week a mass fight broke out in the parking lot of amusement park Särkänniemi, raising concerns over the welfare of teenagers. Central Finland police chief Jari Kinnunen calls group brawls uncommon, but the amount of teenage violence has grown, allegedly aggravated by drug abuse. ""None of these crimes have been committed sober,"" Kinnunen posits in AL. ""Teen fights usually occur in public places and involve narcotics, money, consumer goods or debt collection."" Young men are often the main perpetrators of aggravated assault. The one attempted murder reported this year, however, involved a 17-year-old girl who stabbed a child welfare worker in January, AL writes. ""If we had more manpower, our patrols could make even more of a difference on the streets,"" Kinnunen says. Finally tabloid Ilta-Sanomat features a long-projection weather story with chilly implications. Winter is on its way, as meteorologists carefully concede that the first snow may fall in the north as early as next week. Temperatures will continue to drop nationwide in the days to come, with cold air moving into Lapland from the Arctic Ocean. Subzero conditions are expected on clear autumn nights; but chilliness is not enough for precipitation to freeze into snowflakes, says meteorologist Kristian Roine from Foreca. ""The cold snap has to coincide with a precipitation front in order for snow to be likely. What happens after next week when a dry front retreats and a new low pressure front comes in is anyone's guess. These are time periods that test the limits of our prognoses."""
22.9.2017,Report confirms girls in Finland are taken abroad to undergo FGM,https://yle.fi/uutiset/9846125,"Girls in Finland are at risk of female genital mutilation (FGM), according to a new study released on Friday. The NGO Fenix Helsinki's report cites several instances of girls being transported out of the country for FGM procedures, confirming suspicions that the illegal practice is taking place. Ujuni Ahmed is the chair of Fenix Helsinki. She is a second-generation Somali immigrant, who arrived in Finland as a young girl with her parents in 1991. ""Our study demonstrates that these trips really are organised in Finland. I have also heard that FGM is carried out within the country,"" Ahmed says. Although the report's authors spoke with several women who had undergone FGM, only four agreed to be interviewed for the study. The four women that were interviewed were transported from Finland to different countries - Egypt, Somalia, Syria and Iran - for the illegal procedure. Only one had ever visited a gynaecologist, and all four were not aware of the purpose of the trip ahead of time. ""The continuation of the tradition in Finland is largely influenced by how aware people are of FGM's illegal status and the damage it can do. It is also a matter of how well a person or community is integrated into Finnish society,"" she says. FGM is a cultural tradition that exists in the Middle East, Asia and some African countries. It often involves circumcision of a woman's or girl's external genitals or closure of the vulva. Senior Helsinki and Uusimaa Hospital District (HUS) physician Sinikka Suominen has performed corrective surgery on women and girls who have undergone FGM.  ""I've only had a few patients over the years, despite the fact that our clinic is the only - or one of the only - places that carries out these corrective surgeries in Finland, to my knowledge,"" she says.  She says this tells her that women in Finland aren't aware that corrective measures are available. ""In the end, it is a simple operation that could really help these people. I hope that information about it would spread. We would gladly welcome more patients,"" Suominen says. The report will be handed over today to Tuomas Kurttila, Finland's Ombudsman for Children. ""The study is important because the people in question are Finnish citizens. Until now, we have put our trust in the ability of the healthcare system would prevent this kind of thing from taking place on a widespread basis, but this is clearly not the case,"" he says. Fenix Helsinki's Ahmed says the authorities, victims and families of the victims are united in their lack of information.  ""A minor is rarely able to critically challenge the traditions and habits of their family. It is often a family member that carries out the procedure, sometimes even the girl's own mother,"" she says.   She says Finland still has a long way to go in educating gynaecologists, health care centre workers, doctors and school personnel in how to relay information about FGM, with an emphasis on the illegal status and the health and psychological risks involved.   ""We need to get the data into the communities, so the change can happen from within,"" says Ahmed.  Despite Ahmed having heard about FGM taking place in Finland, not one report of a suspected crime of this nature has been reported to the Finnish police.  National Police Commissioner Seppo Kolehmainen said on Friday that it is almost impossible for the Finnish police to clamp down on FGM. Most of the cases are taking place during visits to foreign countries, as the report has shown. He says the authorities are dependent on health and social service practitioners in this case, because most of the abuse is taking place under a shroud of secrecy.  "
9.3.2012,Aamulehti: Dozens of children victims of sexual abuse,http://yle.fi/uutiset/5075900,"The NBI is investigating ten men, each of which allegedly had sexual intercourse with one or more children. Aamulehti writes that most of the perpetrators are also suspected of abusing kids over the internet. The men reportedly approached girls on internet forums popular among the young, such as kuvake.net. Police say the men also attempted to coax hundreds of kids between the ages of 9 and 15 into sex acts online. The perpetrators approached girls on chat sites and also tried to meet them in person. The most serious crimes involved face-to-face meetings for which the suspects travelled long distances, head of investigation Tero Haapala told Aamulehti. The men are not believed to be connected, even though some of them had the same victims. Some of the suspects are themselves fathers. The crimes are suspected to have occurred between summer 2009 and the end of 2011. The first suspects were detained at the end of last year, but most of them are still at large as they await charges."

1.5.2010,Newspaper Reports Widespread Sexual Abuse Linked with Lutheran Church,http://yle.fi/uutiset/5554934,"More than 20 cases have come to the knowledge of people in the church who have been asked to investigate the matter. Over the decades, the number of victims in church circles is estimated at over 100, and the number of perpetrators is believed to be in the dozens, says child welfare expert Johanna Hurtig. She also believes that the cases that have come to light are but the tip of the iceberg. The issue has been raised in the wake of sex scandals that have hit the Roman Catholic Church in a number of countries. Last week, leaders of the Finnish Lutheran Church urged possible victims of abuse to come forward. Martti Esko, the director of the church's family affairs council, says that some clergy and other church workers are among the suspects. He says that youth work is the area where the number of cases is the highest. In two cases from many years back, a victim claims that a bishop at the time had downplayed the matter and covered it up. In addition, about 10 lay preachers of the Laestadian revival movement are suspected of abuse. In the past year six Laestadian men have been convicted of sexual abuse. Some of the convictions brought prison sentences of 8-12 years, which suggests that the crimes were very serious, according to Helsingin Sanomat."

National Police Commissioner Mikko Paatero hopes that the higher figures are at least partially explained by an increase in the rate of reporting the crimes, rather than a spike in the number of crimes themselves. According to Statistics Finland, this year has also seen a rise in police reports of assault, drug-related crimes, robberies and malicious damage."
27.9.2012,More young victims of sexual abuse seeking help,http://yle.fi/uutiset/6312871,"Sex therapist
Kristiina Hannila of Helsinki's ""Girls' House"" centre says that it is
hard to give precise figures, but the number of girls she sees looking for help
has gone up. Many incidents,
however, remain hidden. ""I believe
that what comes to light in public is just the tip of the iceberg. Cases cannot
always be solved, and so they never go to court,"" Hannila points out. There are many
kinds of sexual abuse faced by children and young people. Abuse takes place
both in the home and online. According to
police, sexual crimes targeting minors committed by total strangers are a
rarity. But online, there are growing risks. ""The truth is
that even if a child is at home, he or she is not safe if the net provides
access to the outside world,"" points out Senior Constable Jari Lindholm. Kristiina Hannila
believes that one important role of an open discussion of sexual abuse is to make minors more aware of what sexual abuse is. The most important
factor in prevention, however, is involved parenting. ""Take the
time to listen to what's going on in the life of the child. I would encourage
parents to ask their children what they are doing online. Usually children and
the young are keen to explain, if their parents only ask,"" said psychologist
Jenni Häikiö.  "
26.10.2016,Prosecutor demands long jail time in incest case,http://yle.fi/uutiset/9253990,"A man in Oulu could face up to eight years in prison after admitting sexually abusing and repeatedly raping his own daughter over a period of nine years. The prosecutor is demanding a jail sentence of eight years for the crimes, along with compensation totalling 45,000 euros. The man's lawyer has said he plans to plead guilty, and the defence will ask for a psychiatric assessment. The daughter, now aged 26, had waived her right to anonymity and asked for the proceedings to be held in public, in an effort to encourage other victims of abuse to come forward. Social workers have come under fire over their roles in the case, as the daughter had an abortion at the age of eleven and gave birth to a child. According to Terttu Utriainen, a criminal law professor at University of Lapland, the authorities charged with preventing abuse and neglect work within three agencies: in child welfare, health care and in educational settings. Utriainen told Yle radio that the different agencies generally work on their own, each bound by confidentiality rules, a situation that results in poor communication.  ""I think what happened is that each sector were working in their own areas and their own confidentiality guidelines and this is how the information [about the abuse] was not communicated forward,"" Utriainen said. She said that families often want to keep matters private in cases of incest - making work more difficult for officials."

Police did say that an investigation is underway and that only three cases of sexual abuse had been formally filed. According to the local director of social services, the girls had been drugged before being assaulted, although she was unable to say what types of drugs were used on the children. She also said that there was a link to Satan worship. The abuses came to light when one of the girls sought help at a local public health centre. The girls had feared that their abusers would harm them or their families if exposed. The incidents of abuse took place mostly in Toijola, a community of 8 300 residents 140 kilometres northwest of Helsinki. It is possible that they were also taken elsewhere and assaulted. The girls are under the protection of the authorities at an undisclosed location."
3.10.2008,"Survey: Child Violence ""Common""",http://yle.fi/uutiset/6113629,"
A child victim survey published by the Police College of Finland shows violence against children to be commonplace. According to the survey, one fifth of boys and about 15 percent of girls claimed to have been victims of violence during the past year either at home or among acquaintances. Five percent said they suffered injuries and one out of 100 needed medical attention for their wounds. However, the survey indicated a reduction in reported levels of sexual abuse against children. Boys said they were most often victims of violence at school or among friends, while girls faced violence at home. Less Corporal Punishment A third of ninth-graders and one-fifth of sixth-graders said they were on the receiving end of mild corporal punishment at home. Compared to earlier research carried out two decades ago, this represents a drop in domestic corporal punishment by about one half. Serious sexual abuse appears to be on the decline. However, lesser offences tend to be more often reported than before. In addition, one fifth of ninth-grade girls said they had received internet requests to send pictures or had received requests for sex. The research was carried out in January, 2008. Over 13,500 children between the ages of 12 and 15 were interviewed."
9.4.2009,Jail Time for Sex Offender,http://yle.fi/uutiset/5236814,"The Helsinki District Court ruled that the 39-year-old man had on several occasions engaged in sexual contact with two boys, whose ages ranged from 13 to 15 at the time of the abuse. The sexual abuse occurred between the winters of 2008 and 2009. The man was also charged with obscenity because of indecent pictures of children that he circulated. He was ordered to pay some 8,500 euros in legal fees that arose from the court proceedings. Documents related to the case will be sealed for 60 years."
10.5.2005,More Child Welfare Concerns Reported,http://yle.fi/uutiset/5216273,"The number of formal child protection notifications has increased in most parts of the country. The biggest increases have been in the Helsinki region. During the 2003-04 school year, half of Helsinki schools reported child protection concerns. Most reports involved 13-to-16 year old pupils. Sirpa Taskinen of the National Research and Development Centre for Welfare and Health (STAKES) noted that the survey did not provide details of the causes behind child protection notifications. However, it is understood that they include concerns about truancy, bullying and drug abuse."
12.10.2016,Man arrested on suspicion of incest,http://yle.fi/uutiset/9226535,"The Oulu District Court imprisoned a man on Wednesday with probable cause on suspicion of aggravated sexual abuse of a minor. The victim is alleged to be a member of the man's family. The crimes allegedly took place in Oulu during the period of Jan 1, 1999 to Jan 24, 2008 The court ordered the man be held in pretrial custody in the Oulu Prison and to be brought before the court on October 26, in two weeks' time. The imprisonment proceedings were held on Wednesday afternoon behind closed doors and without an audience present.

The court arrested the man in absentia on October 8, and on Tuesday he was escorted to Oulu."
11.8.2012,"Police: up to 2,000 victims in child sex crimes",http://yle.fi/uutiset/6252690,"The
investigation started last autumn, when the parents of a girl in the western
Uusimaa region reported the sexual abuse of their daughter to the police.  On
Saturday, the daily Kaleva reported that the police now suspect that as many as
two thousand Finnish girls may be victims of sexual abuse or attempts at this.  In
March, the number of victims in Southern Finland was said to be in the hundreds.
 More
than ten men are suspected of the sex crimes, according to Kaleva. The police
suspects that each had tens of victims, and that the men operated independent
of each other. Their victims were, however, the same.  Kaleva
reports that tens of the girls are from the Oulu region. Many more victims are
found across the country, between the northern city of Oulu and Finland’s southern
tip of Hanko. The youngest girls are nine years old, while most are between the
ages of 13 and 15.  Most
of the girls were abused online, though some also met the men and had
intercourse with them.  Two of
the suspects are from the north, while the rest come from the capital region,
Tampere and Uusimaa province. Some of the suspects are in long-term relationships,
and many have families.  “As
far as we know, the men’s spouses had no knowledge of their actions. This has
understandably led to serious family crises,” Chief Inspector Tero Haapala of the National
Bureau of Investigation told Kaleva.  According
to Haapala, the suspected men found their victims in internet chat forums and
other web services popular with young girls. Most prominent among the sites
where the predatory men sought girls was the chat-room ‘Kuvake.net’. "
12.8.2011,Concern about children’s welfare grows,http://yle.fi/uutiset/5406014,"Statistics indicate that the threshold to reporting a child in need of help to the authorities has become lower over the past year in the nation's ten largest cities. This, in fact, was once of the intended features of revised child welfare legislation that came into force in 2008. In Vantaa, the number of notifications has shot up by almost a fifth. In Tampere they were found to have increased by 16% over last year's levels at the same time of year, while in Helsinki total numbers have remained more or less steady. But, for example, the beginning and the end of the school year always brings a spike in notifications in most bigger towns and cities. 
More than one reason
 Municipal authorities say that child welfare notifications are made for a range of different reasons. In Helsinki, the single largest reason for seeking help for a child is his or her criminal activities. The same is true in the adjoining city of Vantaa. For the most part this involves shoplifting by minors. In Tampere, the most common reason for children being referred to welfare authorities is alcohol abuse by their parents. Welfare officials in Vantaa have expressed concern that they see so few notifications about small children in need of help. ""Matters rarely resolve themselves. They should be dealt with as early as possible,"" points out Jaana Vilpas of Vantaa's Child Welfare Services. In Tampere, if fact, the bulk of notifications to officials concern children under the age of six in need of help. A child welfare notification can be submitted to the municipal social office by telephone, in writing or by paying a visit personally to a social office. Any person, who is concerned about a child’s wellbeing, can submit a child welfare notification. Authorities working with children and families are obliged by law to submit a child welfare notification, if they are concerned about a child’s wellbeing."
28.8.2009,Man Sentenced to 12 Years for Serious Sex Crimes,http://yle.fi/uutiset/5870507,"According to the decision by Helsinki District Court, the defendant had repeatedly assaulted all seven plaintiffs. The sex crimes targeted two children who ranged in age between four and fourteen when the crimes were committed. The abuse continued over a period of ten years. The court took into consideration the lengthy duration and large number of the crimes, and the psychological damage that was caused. The documents in the case were declared confidential for 60 years."
22.1.2009,Fine Over TV Programme on Incest,http://yle.fi/uutiset/5716401,"The Finnish Supreme Court has ordered a journalist working for the YLE investigative television programme MOT and a former programme director to pay heavy fines in a case involving violation of privacy. Four years ago MOT aired a programme on incest. One of the people interviewed for the programme was a father who had been convicted of sexual abuse of his children. The Supreme Court found that revealing the father’s identity violated the privacy of the children involved and their mother. Previously, the defendants had been acquitted by the Helsinki Court of Appeals."
