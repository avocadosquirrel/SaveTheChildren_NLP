108;irrelevant;Macron–Trudeau ‘bromance’ fires up internet;Philippine Daily Inquirer;Philippine Daily Inquirer;Sun, 28 May 2017 00:39:16 PST;article;Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and President-elect Emmanuel Macron. AP FILE PHOTOS TAORMINA, Italy — “A liberal fantasy dream sequence,” “a bromance,” “insanely romantic.” The internet was abuzz on Friday with pictures of French President Emmanuel Macron and his Canadian counterpart Justin Trudeau schmoozing at the G7 summit in Sicily, strolling through flowered walkways and chatting against the backdrop of a sparkling blue Mediterranean sea.  “Apparently Justin Trudeau and Emmanuel Macron flew to Sicily for their wedding photoshoot,” netizen @sherlockify joked on Twitter. The reaction to the telegenic pair’s encounter in the picturesque, hillside town of Taormina, immortalized by Macron himself who tweeted a video of their meeting, provided some light relief from a summit otherwise devoted to thorny issues such as climate change and the threat of extremism.  “The Franco-Canadian friendship has a new face,” Macron tweeted after sitting down for talks with Trudeau and taking the now famous stroll. “@JustinTrudeau, it’s up to us to take on the challenges of our generation!”  “Sitting down with @EmmanuelMacron for the first time, talking jobs, security & climate—looking forward to more conversations, my friend,” Trudeau responded on Twitter, posting pictures of both smiling, shaking hands, and looking out over the Mediterranean, their dapper suit jackets billowing in the breeze. Trudeau, 45, is popular with liberals worldwide for his commitment to fighting climate change and easing the refugee crisis—in stark contrast to the United States, Canada’s powerful neighbor. Macron, 39, has only been in power for 12 days but enjoys similar kudos, particularly abroad where he has been compared to Trudeau. “This image of Trudeau and Macron in Sicily is right out of a liberal fantasy dream sequence,” tweeted Dhruva Jaishankar, an expert on foreign policy at the India section of the Brookings Institution think tank. Others were even more explicit.  “Le swoon, le sigh,” tweeted netizen MissMary, above a photo of both leaders in apparent earnest chat. “Is there a budding bromance between Macron and Trudeau? Two hunks!” added @MaureenRamsden. —AFP;Headlines;['Emmanuel Macron', 'Justine Trudeau', 'Macron-Trudeau bromance'];https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/900209/macron-trudeau-bromance-fires-up-internet;12

However, the management clarified that liquids will be tested and verified first before it would be allowed inside the station. The MRT-3 management said commuters should drink their bottled water, spray their perfumes, and spread their lotions or rubbing alcohol in front of station security personnel to confirm its safety.  “Muli po naming ipinapaalala na maaari niyo pong kunin ang inyong mga nakumpiskang liquid item mula nang ipinatupad ang pagbabawal ng anumang likido, sa aming Station Control Room sa istasyon kung saan ito nakumpiska,” the management said in an advisory. “Ipakita lamang ang inyong ID (identification card) sa aming Station Supervisor upang makuha ang mga  nasabing item,” it added.

Education Secretary Armin Luistro said this week that the state has allocated 56 percent more funds for SPED than in the past, allotting P180 million this year compared to P115 million last year.  DepEd is also set to open 69 new SPEd centers this coming school year, increasing the number of specialized learning centers from 276 to 345. SPED centers cater to the education needs of gifted children and those with learning disabilities. The centers employ specially trained teachers who employ teaching methods designed for optimum learning of students with special needs.  “We believe that special learners deserve special attention and specialized learning tools, thus the increase in funding support,” Luistro said. Out of the fund, each SPED center will get a P500,000 subsidy for pupil development activities, including training, educational trips, camp activities, sports and other events.  The amount will also fund the procurement of instructional materials, supplies and learning assessment tools. DepEd also allotted funds for training of more teachers, school heads and SPED supervisors. “Instructional materials to be procured for gifted children should be over and above those already included in the regular program. The instructional materials should likewise be able to develop the gifted child’s intellectual abilities and talents in the arts and sciences, mathematics, social sciences, and communications,” Luistro said. Luistro instructed division and regional offices to monitor the implementation of the SPED program. “I enjoin all concerned school officials to strictly comply with the fund utilization guidelines so we can deliver the best service to our special learners,” he said. ;Nation;['budget', 'DepEd', 'Education', 'Gifted Children', 'Learning Disability', 'special education'];https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/173037/deped-widens-reach-of-special-education-program;4
639;irrelevant;DENR to issue temporary order against waste imports;Philippine Daily Inquirer;Jhesset O. Enano;Fri, 16 Aug 2019 05:42:34 PST;article;The Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) will soon come out with an administrative order that would impose a three-month moratorium on waste-related imports, following the longstanding controversies on waste imported by the country. The order, expected to be issued within the month, would also implement a P3-million security bond for every permit issued to importers, which could cover potential export expenses should violations be found in the scrap materials shipped from other countries.  Environment Undersecretary Benny Antiporda said the moratorium would cover recyclable materials, including scrap metals, plastics, electronic waste, used oil and fly ash. At present, these are allowed to enter the country through a DENR administrative order issued in 2013. “We need to come up with safeguards on the importation of recyclable materials,” Antiporda said in an interview.  The moratorium period, he said, will allow deliberations among government agencies, industries and other concerned parties on crafting long-term policy for accepting scrap materials, which mostly come from rich countries. “We have to take into consideration as well the industries that benefit from these waste-related imports,” he added.  Antiporda said processed engineered fuels (PEF) would also be covered by the order. In May, shipments from Australia containing these materials were intercepted at a port in Misamis Oriental province. These materials were reportedly going to be used in cement production. Calls for stronger policies concerning the illegal entry of waste came after President Duterte lashed out at Canada  for its delay in taking back the 2,500 tons of trash wrongly declared as recyclable scrap when it was shipped to the Philippines some five years ago. The containers, which were left in the country’s ports for much of that time, were found to contain household garbage, including used adult diapers, unsorted plastics and electronic waste. Similar waste imports were found to have arrived in the country from other parts of the world, including South Korea and Hong Kong.  In response to the Duterte administration’s call to ban foreign waste, the Bureau of Customs has formed a unit to monitor the entry of such hazardous materials. Environmental groups have been pressuring wealthy countries against dumping their garbage elsewhere, including countries in Southeast Asia. Greenpeace Southeast Asia-Philippines has pointed out the “pattern of misdeclaration, falsified documents, fake business and loose regulatory systems” that allow the illegal entry of garbage into the country. EcoWaste Coalition also called for the country’s ratification of the Basel Ban Amendment, which would prohibit the export of hazardous waste from rich countries to developing nations for any reason, including recycling. Top waste exporters were identified as the United States, United Kingdom, Germany and Japan.;Headlines;['Benny Antiporda', 'Department of Environment and Natural Resources', 'temporary order against waste imports'];https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1154406/denr-to-issue-temporary-order-against-waste-imports;4

The cause of the fire could not yet be determined as probers were still gathering clues and evidence from the site as of Sunday afternoon, he said.  He added that residents in the area had no idea what sparked the fire. An occupant of the house where the fire started was doing her laundry in front of the house at the time it happened. “She was horrified upon seeing her house burning … the fire was already huge,” De la Torre said.;Metro;['Fire', 'Marikina City', 'Philippines - Metro'];https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/101379/fire-destroys-houses-made-of-light-materials-in-marikina-city;4
642;irrelevant;‘Teachers buy chalk, cops get free bullets’;Philippine Daily Inquirer;DJ Yap;Mon, 26 Aug 2019 05:38:43 PST;article;WRITING TOOL A teacher reaches for a chalk above the blackboard. —LYN RILLON MANILA, Philippines — “Why should teachers pay for chalk and bond paper out of their own pocket when police officers get bullets for free?” a Twitter user wrote in a viral post last week, quoting a public school teacher. As though in response, Deputy Speaker Vilma Santos-Recto has filed a bill creating a “teaching supplies allowance” amounting to P10,000 per year for each of the country’s 840,000 public school teachers.  Supplies allowance Under House Bill No. 3449, or the proposed Teaching Supplies Allowance Act, the Batangas representative wants to give government teachers an allowance for the purchase of chalks, erasers, forms and other classroom supplies and materials.  Based on the proposal, an initial amount of P3,500 per teacher per school year shall be charged against the current appropriations of the Department of Education (DepEd). An additional P6,500 per teacher shall then be charged against the available funds and/or savings of the DepEd.  Low salaries “Thereafter, the amount of P10,000 per teacher per school year shall be included in the DepEd budget for Teaching Supplies Allowance under the General Appropriations Act,” according to the bill. Recto noted the low salaries for public school teachers. “Aside from spending for their personal and family needs, teachers also have to shell out some more money from their own pockets for the materials they use in teaching,” Recto said. Her bill also seeks to increase the cash allowance of teachers by 185 percent, from P3,500 to P10,000 per teacher per school year.  Recto cited Republic Act No. 4670, or the Magna Carta for Public School Teachers, which mandates that the salaries of public school teachers “shall be such as to insure teachers a reasonable standard of life for themselves and their families.” Unfortunately, she said their salaries were currently bound by the salary standardization law (SSL), “hence, compensation increases would be subject to comparisons with the qualification, skills and difficulties of other positions in the government.” “Thus, one of the urgent ways to respond to the clamor of our public school teachers for much needed support is to grant them with additional benefits in the form of cash allowances, which would not be subject to the SSL,” Recto said.;Nation;['DepEd', 'teaching supplies allowance', 'Vilma Santos-Recto'];https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1157416/teachers-buy-chalk-cops-get-free-bullets;5
644;irrelevant;Drilon challenges DTI to ‘seize’ opportunity, boost efforts to lure major firms moving out of China;INQUIRER.net;Christia Marie Ramos;Fri, 22 May 2020 15:09:13 PST;article;MANILA, Philippines — The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) should boost its efforts to lure multinational companies planning to move out of China amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Senate Minority Franklin Drilon said Friday. Drilon issued the call as he expressed concern over reports that the Philippines is lagging behind in terms of efforts to woo investors leaving China, including major firms from Japan and the United States, as compared to other Southeast Asian countries.  “I do not see enough efforts being done, as compared with our neighboring countries such as Indonesia, Vietnam and Thailand, to win over the biggest companies moving out from China to relocate into the country,” the senator said in a statement. “This is an opportunity that we should seize immediately. The competition is tough. We cannot afford a laid-back attitude especially in this most trying time in our history as a nation,” he added.  He said the DTI should “reach out” to the said companies as he noted that potential investments from these firms “will help our economy heavily battered by this pandemic.” Drilon said that the government should device “a more aggressive strategy” to woo these companies to relocate to the Philippines.  “Ang nakakalungkot ay yung mga tira-tira na lang ang napupunta sa atin. Hindi tayo kulelat kasi may maliliit na negosyong mapupunta sa atin.I do not think that that is the proper way to look at it,” he said. Drilon noted that the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry of the Philippines, Inc. (JCCIPI) had earlier said that Japanese manufacturing companies in China are looking to relocate their production to Vietnam, Indonesia, and Thailand due to supply chain, resources, and raw material production. “The reality is, we need investments more than ever for our economy to recover from this COVID-19 disease and to provide jobs and livelihood opportunities to Filipinos who lost jobs due to the pandemic,” Drilon said. This as he noted that the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) had estimated that around five million Filipinos would lose jobs due to the health crisis. “Tell us the stumbling blocks we are facing here and if concerns legislation, Congress will fix it,” Drilon said.  The senator said that among the legislative measures that would help attract companies into the Philippines are bills seeking to amend the Public Service Act and the Retail Trade Act. Drilon said the “restrictive” requirements of both laws “impede” foreign investments in the country. Senate Bill No. 13 seeks to limit the definition of public utility while opening up other public services to the market while Senate Bill No. 14 seeks to further relax foreign restrictions by removing investment categories and setting an across the board minimum paid-up capital investment of US$200,000. Drilon, who authored the twin economic measures, then urged the government to include his two measures as priority legislation.;Nation;['companies', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Department of Trade and Industry', 'DTI', 'Nation', 'news', 'Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon'];https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1279391/drilon-challenges-dti-to-seize-opportunity-boost-efforts-to-lure-major-firms-moving-out-of-china;5
645;irrelevant;COA: Palace bureau paid P100K for dead phone lines;Philippine Daily Inquirer;Patricia Denise M. Chiu;Thu, 29 Aug 2019 05:36:00 PST;article;MANILA, Philippines — No dial tone, no payment. But a Malacañang communication service still paid PLDT Inc. some P100,000 for landlines that were not working, clearly an imprudent use of public funds.  The Commission on Audit (COA) has directed the Bureau of Communications Services (BCS) to recover the P110,081.51 it had paid to the telecommunications giant. The BCS is an attached agency of the Presidential Communications Operations Office (PCOO) tasked with providing materials and services related to various functions of the presidency and the PCOO. It also produces information materials for state events.  Worn-out hardware In its annual audit report, the COA said the bureau paid bills for seven months although nine out of 12 lines for key officials had bogged down and were virtually unusable starting June 2018.  “As there was no repair or maintenance made by the agency, the nine lines fully bogged down in October 2018. Despite the situation, BCS paid and [is] … still paying the monthly service fees for the inoperative lines,” the report said. It was only in November 2018 that the BCS reached out to its parent agency, the PCOO, to request a telephone technician to fix the problem. “It was diagnosed that the problem was caused by worn-out telephone wires and telephone units of BCS, and by faulty cabling from the PLDT main distribution frame,” the audit report said. It said that while “concerned maintenance personnel” reported the issues to PLDT, the company had not solved the faulty cabling, “to the disadvantage of the agency and the government.” No cost-benefit analysis  In November 2018, the BCS made a purchase request to replace broken phone lines and units. The dismal response to the lack of phone service can be attributed to the bureau’s failure to come up with proper administrative guidelines on the maintenance of its communication lines, according to the COA. “Per inquiry, the agency has not conducted assessment or cost-benefit analysis on the quality of service provided by PLDT Inc. despite … [the] existing conditions,” the audit body said. Aside from ordering the BCS to demand a refund from PLDT, the COA directed the agency to formulate guidelines on how telephone cables, parts and  units could be regularly maintained and kept serviceable. The COA urged the BCS to put in place a monitoring system for troubleshooting telephone line problems. The BCS has agreed to follow the audit body’s recommendations.;Headlines;No Tags;https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1158729/coa-palace-bureau-paid-p100k-for-dead-phone-lines;5

The Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines said the investigation into the plane crash might take a while with probers taking into consideration all possibilities that led to the crash. AP PHOTO/ARMED FORCES OF THE PHILIPPINES MANILA, Philippines—The Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines said the investigation into the plane crash that killed Interior Secretary Jesse Robredo might take a while with probers taking into consideration all possibilities that led to the crash. “There are many factors in an accident: there’s the human factor, the maintenance factor, the material factor…The weather can be a factor as well. Hopefully we can re-create [the aircraft’s condition] before and after the crash,” CAAP director-general William Hotchkiss III told reporters.  The CAAP earlier created a three-man team to conduct an inquiry into the crash. The team is currently in Masbate to examine the wreckage of the Piper PA-34 Seneca aircraft that was recovered from the sea. The team will be interviewing at least three witnesses who could shed light on the pre-flight preparations and the final communications between the aircraft and the airport control tower at the Mactan Cebu International Airport.  The lone survivor in the crash, Robredo’s aide, Chief Inspector June Paolo Abrazado, will also be invited to testify. Hotchkiss said that the recovery of the two engines of the Piper Seneca aircraft would be important, although he said foreign expertise would have to be consulted to determine if the crash was engine-related.  “The Philippines has no capability to look into an engine and see what was wrong with it. We’ll have to send for an expert outside of the country before we can render a judgment. There might have been engine failure; one or two engines might have failed,” he added. Hotchkiss did not say which experts would be consulted by the CAAP. Piper Seneca aircraft are manufactured by Piper Aircraft Inc. based in Vero Beach, Florida. The CAAP earlier suspended the flying school and air taxi operations of Aviatour Air, which owned the downed Piper Seneca aircraft. The CAAP has yet to conclude its investigation of a March accident involving another Aviatour plane that crashed in Camiguin, killing the pilot and a Norwegian passenger.";Nation;[];https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/256704/caap-probe-into-robredo-plane-crash-to-take-time;6

940;irrelevant;Traveling abroad? Make sure you’re immunized against measles;INQUIRER.net US Bureau;INQUIRER.net US Bureau;2019-05-13T16:52:46+00:00;article; WASHINGTON, DC — People planning to travel internationally should ensure they have already received the recommended two doses of measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine.  Nationwide, measles cases now total 704 in 2019, the highest since 1994. Nearly all of these cases have been linked to international travel by unvaccinated people who have then spread the virus to unvaccinated populations in the U.S. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends two doses of MMR vaccine: the first dose at 12-15 months of age and the second dose at 4-6 years of age. Adults travelling internationally should get vaccinated for measles if they did not receive the two doses as children. Vaccination is the best protection against measles.  Talk to your doctor about travel immunizations at least 4-6 weeks before traveling. For those travelling internationally with a baby older than 6 months but younger than 12 months, the CDC recommends that the baby receive an early dose of MMR vaccine. Infants and young children who contract measles are at risk of serious complications. “The best way to protect yourself and your family from measles is by making sure that you are vaccinated,” said Solano County Health Officer Dr. Bela Matyas.  “The vaccine is highly effective and can keep you protected for life. When a high percentage of our residents is vaccinated, the disease cannot easily be passed on to anyone. This is called ‘herd immunity’ and it gives protection to vulnerable people such as young children and those who are too sick to be vaccinated.” Measles is still common in many parts of the world: in Europe, Asia, the Pacific, South America, and Africa, including the Philippines, Israel, India, and Ukraine. If you are planning a trip, protect yourself against diseases that are more common in the country you are visiting. Measles is so contagious that if one person has it, up to 90 percent of the people close to that person who are not immune will also become infected. A person with measles can spread the disease to others even before symptoms appear. The incubation period for developing measles is up to 21 days after being exposed to someone else who has the disease. Common symptoms of measles include fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, and a rash, which can appear 7 to 21 days after the exposure. Talk to your doctor about getting the MMR vaccine before traveling. Measles immunizations are available at your healthcare provider, local pharmacy, or health clinic.

941;irrelevant;World Vision urges Congress not to water down pro-breastfeeding Milk Code;Philippine Daily Inquirer;Jeannette I. Andrade;Thu, 08 May 2014 01:30:16 PST;article;"AFP FILE PHOTO MANILA, Philippines—An international child health advocacy group has urged members of the House of Representatives to oppose proposals to water down the country’s Milk Code—which advances breastfeeding over the use of milk formula—adding that breastfeeding is proven to be effective in preventing deaths of children under five years old. At a forum on Wednesday in Quezon City, the World Vision Development Foundation Inc maintained that malnutrition has remained the biggest underlying cause of child deaths, which can be prevented through the promotion of breast milk over infant formulas.  During Wednesday’s forum, the culmination of the group’s global week of action for its “Child Health Now” campaign, World Vision submitted a petition with some 7,500 signatures calling on senators and members of the lower house of Congress to defend the Milk Code or Executive Order 51 (EO 51). The Milk Code is a law that ensures safe and adequate nutrition for infants through the promotion of breastfeeding and the regulation of promotion and distribution of artificial milk formulas and other similar products.  “We call on you to be steadfast in saying no to amendment attempts to the Milk Code as these will undermine breastfeeding practice… The Milk Code does not need amendments, instead, there should be a consolidated, stronger will to enforce it. We reiterate our call on you, our legislators at the Senate and the House of Representatives, to do your due diligence to oppose any effort to amend the Milk Code,” the petition states. It further said, “As duty bearers and stewards of the State, you owe it to your people, especially the helpless under five children, to protect and promote their nurturance from which may depend their very survival.”  Child health advocates said breastfeeding could prevent the death of one in five children under five years old in developing countries.  World Vision submitted copies of the petition to Representatives Maria Lourdes Acosta-Alba, of Bukidnon’s 1st district; Ibarra Gutierrez III of the Akbayan partylist, vice-chair to the committee on the revision of laws; and Teodorico Haresco Jr of Aklan’s lone district and chair of the house committee on Milennium Development Goals. Yvonette Duque, World Vision manager for the child well-being program, said in a statement that the local Milk Code has turned out to be among the best adaptations of the International Code on the marketing of breastmilk substitutes. “Any attempt to amend EO 51 poses risk to the already existing Milk Code and so we propose for its full implementation rather than amendment so we can experience the full strength of this law that will redound to better child health,” she said. For his part, World Vision executive director Josaias dela Cruz said that the topmost preventive measure against malnutrition is “optimal breastfeeding.” Dela Cruz added, “We really believe that mother’s milk is still best. This is what God intended it to be.”  He pointed out, “Malnutrition remains the biggest underlying cause of child deaths.” Dela Cruz said that both the World Health Organization and the Department of Health recommended optimal breastfeeding to prevent child malnutrition. Optimal breastfeeding requires infants from birth to two years to be breastfed. “Rather than amendment, we call for stronger enforcement of the Milk Code with its Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations and we need strong political will to realize the full strength of the Milk Code,” he concluded. Meanwhile, Dr. Anthony Calibo, the Department of Health’s Family Health Office, “Any attempt to water down or weaken the Milk Code in its natural state might really hamper our progress.” Calibo said that deaths of children under five years old were usually caused by illnesses such as: pneumonia, diarrhea, and other health problems, that arise from malnutrition.

Biologists from Australia’s Monash University found that the antidepressant fluoxetine, more commonly known as Prozac, in contaminated water tend to increase the sexual drive of fish swimming in it, according to a statement from the university.  The study involved mosquitofish caught in the wild and exposing them to the contaminated water. Exposure to the antidepressant-laced water resulted in “males spending a greater amount of time pursuing females.” “The effects of fluoxetine on wildlife behaviour have seldom been investigated across multiple fitness-related contexts, especially at environmentally realistic concentrations,” said lead study author Jake Martin.  The study, published in the scientific journal Science of the Total Environment, highlighted the effects of pharmaceutical pollution on wildlife. A separate study done by co-author Bob Wong also found fluoxetine affected behavior needed to evade predators.  /ra  RELATED STORIES:  Nearly 90 elephants found dead due to poaching New Zealand village plans pet cat ban to save native birds 300 endangered sea turtles found dead off Mexican coast;Animals;['Antidepressants', 'Prozac', 'Sex Drive', 'water pollution'];https://technology.inquirer.net/80355/fish-get-extra-horny-due-to-antidepressants-in-contaminated-water;27
170;OVAA;K-pop star Sulli’s death sparks soul-searching on misogynistic culture, journalism ethics;The Korea Herald/Asia News Network;The Korea Herald/Asia News Network;Sun, 03 Nov 2019 14:59:06 PST;article;"Sulli. SM Entertainment via The Korea Herald/Asia News Network SEOUL — When 25-year-old South Korean singer-actress Sulli was found dead at her home last month, it was described as “murder by fingertips.” Sulli, whose real name was Choi Jin-ri, was at the center of online vitriol for defying the country’s social norms — from wearing a shirt without a bra in public and being candid about her romantic relationships to live-streaming a drinking session with friends.  The former member of top Korean girl group f(x) also came under attack from online trolls for speaking out on mental health issues, cyberbullying and advocating women’s rights to abortion, all of which remain sensitive in Korean society. Sulli had been suffering from severe depression, according to the police.  On top of high pressure and intense competition that K-pop stars face from an early age, Sulli’s death has exposed the dark side of a society that has long tolerated cyber insults and hatred against female entertainers, as well as reckless reporting on celebrities’ private lives, experts say. Following Sulli’s death, a number of bills aimed at curbing cyberbullying were submitted to the National Assembly, despite concerns over violations of free speech.  Calls are also mounting for a reflection on journalism ethics and for the enactment of an anti-discrimination bill that could outlaw hate expressions in public. ‘Sulli laws’ Following Sulli‘s death, the presidential office website was flooded with petitions demanding users be required to register their real names before commenting. The petitions also called for heavier punishment for online trolls and media that spread falsehoods. According to a Realmeter poll conducted after Sulli’s death, nearly 70 percent of Koreans supported the adoption of the internet real-name online comment system, while 24 percent opposed it. The public outcry led Daum, the country’s No. 2 portal site, to temporarily close its comments sections under entertainment news through which cyber insults frequently occur.  Against this backdrop, two bills aimed at stamping out online abuse were introduced at the National Assembly on Oct. 25. Rep. Park Dae-chul of the Liberty Korea Party submitted a bill requiring online users to reveal their online user name and Internet Protocol address when posting comments on portals such as Naver and Daum. The portals are a major platform of news consumption in Korea and allow users to comment anonymously. Another bill presented by Rep. Park Sun-sook of the minor opposition Bareunmirae Party targets such portals by requiring them to filter out malicious, discriminatory and hate comments and block netizens posting such comments. “The online platforms became a rubbish bin for anger and raw emotions for many Koreans. They just don’t see the suffering they inflict on victims with a simple, short comment,” said Kwak Geum-joo, a psychology professor at Seoul National University. “They even feel a sense of unity and belonging because so many people leave such malicious comments,” she said. “They don’t feel guilty and even think they are just and right.” Drastic measures such as the internet real-name system are necessary to stop them from hurting others behind an online pseudonym even for a short-term, she added. The internet real-name system, however, was already declared unconstitutional in 2012. The Constitutional Court ruled against a similar law on the internet real-name system, which required Koreans to use their real names on websites, in a unanimous decision, citing restrictions on freedom of speech. Son Ji-won, a lawyer for Open Net Korea, questions how effective the internet real-name system could be in rooting out the widespread cyberbullying.

 “People who leave malicious messages are not concerned about revealing their identity, if you look at social media,” Son said. “Online trolling happens not because we don’t have the internet real-name system, but because of society’s hate culture and low public awareness about human rights.” Such a system would only discourage people from criticizing the powerful and stifle minorities’ opinions because of fears they would be punished, she noted. “Despite the side effects, online anonymity is crucial to those who want to challenge unfair systems, political and economic powers, as well as minorities such as women and sexual minorities (seeking to stand up for their rights),” she said. Misogynic culture, media’s role Sulli’s death also laid bare additional factors that might intensify online trolling — the country’s misogynic culture and media’s clickbaits — experts point out. “Sulli’s provocative remarks, which were not expected from a female K-pop star, drew more misogynic comments and criticisms,” Yoon Kim Ji-yeong, a professor at the Institute of Body and Culture at Konkuk University, said. “Such comments typically accuse female stars of being slutty and cheap, which does not really apply to male stars.” Sulli was rare among K-pop stars in that she vocally expressed her views on women’s rights in the public sphere, upending the entertainment industry’s expectations that they stay silent about their private lives or divisive issues and remain “pure,” obedient and sexually desirable. When Sulli publicly expressed her support for pro-choice movement and defended her decision not to wear a bra, she instantly became the target of anonymous misogynic comments. “There should be some standards on what constitutes misogyny and hatred, why it should be banned and introduce bills that can regulate it,” Yoon said. The entertainment industry commercializing female stars’ sexuality and the media frenzy inducing hate comments also need to be addressed together, Yoon added.

 The unfounded rumors that haunted Sulli were often picked up by news outlets and they were further spread through media. When a controversy surfaced, news outlets would again report on the controversy, inviting more hate comments and generating more online traffic. “The press played a role in creating a cycle of producing and amplifying gossip, prejudices and malicious comments,” said Choi Jin-bong, a media communications professor at Sungkonghoe University. “While the freedom of press must not be controlled, media outlets themselves should establish a system that can monitor and filter out gossip-mongering and provocative contents,” he said.";Celebrities and Showbiz;['Asia', 'Entertainment', 'K-Pop', 'South Korea', 'Sulli'];https://entertainment.inquirer.net/350317/k-pop-star-sullis-death-sparks-soul-searching-on-misogynistic-culture-journalism-ethics;20

377;OVAA;Safe Space law provides stronger protection vs sexual harassment acts;No news platform;No Author;Wed, 25 Sep 2019 07:00:10 PST;No news type;"Ernesto Almocera Jr. | Irene R. Sino Cruz CEBU CITY, Philippines– Catcalling, stalking and cyber stalking are among those cited in Republic Act No. 11313 or the Safe Spaces Act as gender-based sexual harassment acts committed in streets, public spaces, online, workplaces and in educational or training institutions. Violation of the law may be penalized with an imprisonment of 11 days to six months and/or a fine of ranging from P30, 000 to P100,000. Provisions of the law’s  draft Implementing Rules and Regulation (IRR)  was the focus of the discussions during a public consultation organized by the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW) and Plan International Philippines on Tuesday afternoon, September 24, in a hotel in Cebu City. “We’re doing the public consultations to get the comments/feedback of the public, especially the local government units, the DILG (Department of Interior and Local Government), the DSWD (Department of Social Welfare and Development),” said Ernesto Almocera Jr., Plan International Philippines communication and advocacy manager.  Republic Act No. 11313 or the Safe Spaces Act defines catcalling as unwanted remarks directed towards a person commonly done in the form of wolf-whistling. It also refers to misogynistic, transphobic, homophobic, and sexist slurs. A misogynist refers to man who hates women or who believe men are better than women. A transphobic has or shows dislike of or prejudice against transgender people. On the other hand, a person is homophobic if he or she has or shows negative attitudes and feelings toward homosexuality or people who are identified or perceived as being lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender (LGBT). The Safe Spaces Act was signed into law on April 17, 2019 and took effect on August 3, 2019. The landmark legislation seeks to prevent gender-based sexual harassment in the streets, in public places, in public utility vehicles, online, at the workplace and in training institutions. The law also required the drafting of the law’s implementing rules and regulations (IRR), 90 days from its effectivity by concerned implementing agencies. Aside from catcalling, stalking and cyberstalking, other acts considered as sexual harassment crimes in streets and public spaces include cursing, leering, intrusive gazing, taunting, unwanted invitations and persistent unwanted comments on one’s appearance. The law also considers the following as sexual harassment crimes: – Relentless requests for personal details such as names, contact and social media details or destination; – The use of words, gestures or actions that ridicule on the basis of sex, gender and sexual orientation; – Persistent telling of sexual jokes and any comments that has made an invasion on a person’s personal space or threatens a person’s sense of personal safety. The gender-based online sexual harassment acts include the following: – Use of information and communications technology in terrorizing and intimidating victims through physical, psychological and emotional threats online either publicly or through direct and private messages; – Incessant messaging, uploading and sharing without consent of the victim, any form of media that contains photos, voice or video with sexual content; – Any unauthorized recording and sharing of any of the victim’s photos, videos or any information online; – Impersonating victims online or posting lies about victims to harm their reputation; and – Filing false abuse reports to online platforms to silence victims. The local units of the Philippine National Police and the PNP Women and Children’s Protection Desk have the authority to arrest perpetrators and enforce the provisions of the law pertaining to gender-based sexual harassment in streets and public spaces. However, they need to first undergo prior gender sensitivity training. The law also mandates that the local government units have the primary responsibility in enforcing the provisions under Article of the Safe Spaces Act. It also requires the LGU to pass an ordinance to localize the application of the law within 60 days of its effectivity or before October 3, 2019. According to Almocera, they wanted to gather feedback on the draft of IRR so it would be more detailed before it would be signed in October or November. Although the IRR has yet to be finalized and signed, he clarified that some of the law’s provisions could still be implemented. “The purpose ng IRR is to thresh out a few detailed rule and regulations that could help further the implementation of the law,” Almocera said. The penalties for sexual harassment crimes in the streets and public places are as follows: – Aresto menor (11 to 30 days imprisonment or a fine of P30,000 for the first offense; – Aresto mayor (one month and one day to six months) imprisonment or P50,000 fine; and, – Aresto mayor in its maximum period or a fine of P100,000. For gender-based online sexual harassment, a penalty of prison correctional (six months and one day to six years) in its medium period or a fine of not less than P100,000 but not more than P500,000 or both at the discretion of court will be imposed on the perpetrator. / dcb";No news category;No Tags;https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/260153/safe-space-law-provides-stronger-protection-vs-sexual-harassment-acts;25
1318;OVAA;Filipino clerk sentenced to jail, to be deported for filming flatmates in shower;INQUIRER.net;;Wed, 17 Oct 2018 14:56:46 PST;article;INQUIRER.net Stock Photo A Filipino clerk has been sentenced to jail for six months in Dubai after putting a camera in a bathroom ceiling to film his female flatmates while they were naked in the shower. READ: Filipino clerk pleads guilty of filming roommates in shower  The Dubai Court of First Instance convicted the 41-year-old defendant last Thursday, Oct. 11, reported Gulf News. After his jail term, the Filipino defendant will be deported. The clerk had pleaded guilty to violating his Filipino flatmates’ privacy and breaching their modesty. He admitted to police that the videos were for his sexual pleasure.   Last August, one of the female flatmates, a Filipino secretary, noticed a GoPro camera above her head when she was about to take a shower. She informed her other Filipino flatmates of her finding. After taking down the camera, they found footage of them naked in the shower in the memory card.  The women told the clerk of their discovery and he owned up to installing the camera. He convinced them that he did not have any footage left, and so they decided not to press charges.  But one of the women checked the memory card again the next day and saw videos of them that dated back to December 2017. The Filipino women then reported the clerk to the police.   The ruling is subject to appeal on Thursday, Oct. 18.  Niña V.

0;OVAC;Senate probe, telcos’ action on rising online child abuse cases pressed;INQUIRER.net;Christia Marie Ramos;Sun, 09 Aug 2020 12:17:17 PST;article;MANILA, Philippines — Senator Imee Marcos is calling on the Senate to investigate the alarming rise of reported cases of sexual abuse of children online amid lockdowns enforced by the government to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The senator also called out telecommunications firms and internet service providers (ISPs), which she said were “falling short” of their duty under the law to report such cases and install technology that detect and block the transmission of pictorial and live child pornography online.  Marcos pushed for the investigation through Senate Resolution No. 487, where she cited data from the Department of Justice and the Department of Social Welfare and Development which showed that such cases from March to May alone more than tripled to about 260,000 compared to the previous year. The senator raised fears that with more children staying indoors during the pandemic, cases of child sexual abuse may further increase.  She cited a research from the International Justice Mission which found that 62 percent of perpetrators (parents, relatives, family friends, and neighbors) were known to the victims. Preventine measures and technology  “What preventive measures have our telcos and ISPs taken to block avenues of exploitation like online gaming, chat groups, phishing email and other unsolicited contact in social media?” she said in a statement Sunday. “The government has relied more often on foreign authorities,” she added. ‘Global epicenter’ Marcos noted that the Philippines has been considered by the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) as the “global epicenter of the live-stream sex abuse trade” and the top global source of child pornography. Further, she pointed to the recent arrest of an American pedophile in Pampanga, noting that this is just “one of many police operations conducted since the mid-March lockdown.”  The Philippine Internet Crimes Against Children Center has also rescued 34 minors across the country who were involved in online pornography, the senator added. “Europol, which is the European Union’s law enforcement agency, has already warned that sexual predators have also found their way to children via online learning applications,” Marcos said, only a few weeks before the country shifts to online learning amid the pandemic. Pandemic and poverty She warned that this problem will likely get worse across all social classes as the pandemic forces poor families into “deeper poverty and exposing children with access to digital tools to longer engagement in the private world of the internet.” “The pandemic has stripped the layers of protection against the sexual abuse of children, including the income security of parents and public interaction under the watchful eyes of teachers, doctors, law enforcers, and responsible members of the community,” Marcos said. “Even the protection of various laws now appears thin and needs to be reinforced, so that our telcos and ISPs take their responsibilities more seriously,” she added. ;Nation;['COVID-19 lockdown', 'Nation', 'news', 'online child sexual abuse', 'Senator Imee Marcos'];https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1318945/senate-probe-telcos-action-on-rising-online-child-abuse-cases-pressed;1
1;OVAC;8 of 10 Filipino children risk online sexual abuse–Unicef;INQUIRER.net;Yuji Vincent Gonzales;Tue, 07 Jun 2016 17:31:30 PST;article;Eight out of 10 Filipino children are at risk of being victims of sexual abuse or bullying online, according to a recent study by the United Nations Children’s Fund (Unicef). The Unicef-Ipsos study titled “Perils and Possibilities: Growing up online” explored the youth’s perspective on the risks they are facing in the digital world.  Based on an international poll among more than 10,000 18-year-olds from 25 countries, the study added that five in 10 Filipino children and adolescents think “friends participate in risky behaviors while using the internet.” The report also found out that 67 percent of girls “strongly agreed” that they would be worried if they received sexual comments or requests over the internet, compared to 47 percent of boys.  Unicef said the Philippines has become a top global source of child pornography amid rising cases of livestream sexual abuse of webcam “show,” some cases of which involve parents as operators. “We need to raise the awareness and vigilance of this issue so that parents and others understand that child abuse—in any form—is not just morally wrong, it is also extremely harmful to children’s health and development. Unfortunately, at the moment the situation is getting worse, not better,” said Lotta Sylwander, Unicef representative to the Philippines.  Unicef said the number of criminal cases involving livestream child abuse in the Philippines rose from 57 in 2013 to 89 in 2014 and 167 in 2015.  Unicef associate director for child protection Cornelius Williams said the study’s findings showed “how real the risk of online abuse is for girls and boys,” especially in an age when the internet has “revolutionized young people’s access to information.” The agency vowed to “amplify the youth’s voice” in addressing online violence and exploitation, as it partnered with  Child Rights Coalition Asia to produce materials by and for children on how to stay safe online. Unicef also called on the national government to establish “coordinated responses” between criminal justice systems, law enforcement, child welfare, education, health, information and communication technology sectors and civil society “to better protect children from online sexual abuse and exploitation.” “When young people, governments, families, the ICT (information and communication technology) sector and communities work together, we are more likely to find the best ways to respond to online sexual abuse and exploitation, and send a strong message that confronting and ending violence against children online—indeed anywhere—is all of our business,” Williams said.

2;OVAC;DICT moves to cut child online sexual abuse;Philippine Daily Inquirer;Miguel R. Camus;Fri, 24 Nov 2017 13:04:34 PST;article;The Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) is taking big steps to significantly reduce cases of child online sexual exploitation as it implements its nationwide free Wifi internet initiative. The DICT hosted on Thursday the Child Online Protection Summit to help develop protection standards.  The event also sought to highlight the massive problem of online child abuse and exploitation – a cross-border global operation that typically inhabits the so-called dark web or the part of the internet that is hidden from traditional search engines and can only be accessed by special tools and software. Part of the problem is the $3 billion child pornography business, apart from other forms of exploitation and even cyber-bullying.  Moreover, 50 percent of reported cases on cybercrime were online child abuse. This could involve children as young as three months old in what is known as livestream sexual abuse, and often, at the hands of their parents seeking to make “easy money.” Allan Cabanlong, DICT assistant secretary for cybersecurity and enabling technologies, said there were a total of 26,000 such cases reported in the Philippines so far this year.  “The crime solution of that is just a fraction of the total,” he said in an interview at the sidelines of the summit. He said the DICT also wanted to cut reported cases by half, or to 25 percent by 2022. Cabanlong said the issue went beyond crafting polices. “We need tools. That is what we lack,” he said. He said the DICT would establish in 2018 its National Cybercrime Intelligence Center. This would act as a first line responder, helping identify cases, after which enforcers like the Philippine National Police, National Bureau of Investigation, and Department of Justice could step in.  But he noted that funding and support were needed. The Cybercrime Investigation and Coordinating Center of the DICT, for example, has a budget of P10 million. Cabanlong said the “sophisticated tools” required run into multiples of that figure. The unit is also hampered by the lack of manpower to ramp up operations. “We are recruiting next year (2018),” he said. Lending support on Thursday were officials from countries familiar with this problem. These included the Australian Embassy in Manila and the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The DICT wants policies in place as its Wifi initiative is expected to hit over 200,000 hotspots around the country by 2022. The DICT would require all of its partner internet service providers to block access to websites, applications, and programs that promote or provide any access to online sexual abuse and exploitation material on children.           /kga;Nation;['child porn', 'child sexual abuse', 'Communication', 'DICT', 'free WiFi', 'Internet', 'technology'];https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/947351/dict-moves-to-cut-child-online-sexual-abuse;1
3;OVAC;Philippine court convicts American of online child abuse;Associated Press;Associated Press;Thu, 28 May 2020 07:22:23 PST;article;In this April 20, 2017 photo, suspected American child webcam cybersex operator, David Timothy Deakin, is reflected in a mirror as investigators gather evidence during a raid at his home in Mabalacat City, Pampanga.  (AP) MANILA, Philippines — A Philippine court has sentenced an American to life in prison on charges of sexually exploiting Filipino children using webcams to sell videos, photos and livestreams to buyers abroad, an official said Wednesday. National Bureau of Investigation official Janet Francisco said the conviction of David Timothy Deakin is a strong warning to offenders that “they could not hide even if they commit sexual exploitation crimes in cyberspace because law enforcers are collaborating worldwide to catch them.”  Judge Irineo Pangilinan Jr. of the regional trial court in Pampanga province declared Deakin guilty of qualified human trafficking and sentenced him to life imprisonment and ordered him to pay a fine and indemnify his victims. The ruling was handed down online Tuesday because of coronavirus quarantine restrictions. The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation provided the information that led to Deakin’s arrest in April 2017 in Pampanga’s Mabalacat City, Francisco said. Associated Press journalists were allowed to witness the raid on Deakin’s apartment near a red-light district and his arrest.  Francisco, who heads an anti-human trafficking force, said the raid led to the seizure of the largest amount of digital evidence related to online sexual exploitation of children in the country so far. Her agents also found children’s underwear, toddler shoes, cameras, bondage cuffs, fetish ropes, meth pipes and stacks of hard drives and photo albums in Deakin’s two-bedroom apartment. Deakin was originally from Peoria, Illinois, and has been in the Philippines since 2000. He told the AP in an interview shortly after his arrest that he didn’t make videos of children.  The Washington, D.C.-based private group International Justice Mission said its social workers have helped bring eight of Deakin’s victims to recovery and cited one as welcoming his conviction “because he won’t be able to victimize anyone anymore.” Samson Inocencio Jr., who heads the IJM in the Philippines, said the justice system should continue protecting vulnerable children who are unsafe during the coronavirus lockdown. A study released by the group last week said the Philippines has emerged as a global hot spot for online child sexual exploitation, with cases increasing sharply in recent years. Parents have agreed to have their own children victimized for the money. The webcam scheme involves pedophiles in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Australia who pay facilitators to sexually abuse children, even babies, in the privacy of Philippine homes. They watch and help direct the abuses through online livestreaming services. The wide use of English, availability of internet connections and international cash transfer systems have combined with long-entrenched poverty and wide access to vulnerable children to allow many abuses to happen in the Philippines.

Isolated in their homes, Filipinos used cyberconnections not just for maintaining relations with loved ones but also for conducting business, attending remote conferences or meetings, shopping for food deliveries and other necessities, seeking entertainment, and for children and students attending cyberclasses or for adults taking part in tutorials on anything from cooking to crafts to foreign languages.  But as with any convenience and technological advance, unlimited access to the wonders of the internet also brought with it attendant risks. One of the most prominent would have to be the tremendous, appalling increase in internet-based child sexual exploitation. The Philippines, in fact, has been identified as a “global hotspot” for online sexual exploitation of children (OSEC).  Reports say that the number of cases of OSEC has tripled in the last three years, with the International Justice Mission (IJM) reporting that 41 percent of the abuse cases were facilitated by biological parents and 42 percent by other relatives, or at least 83 percent by people related to the child victims. Even more critically, the Department of Justice-Office of Cybercrime (DOJ-OOC) reported that there has been a 264.63 percent increase in the number of reported OSEC between March 1 and May 24, compared to the same period last year.  The increase in the cybersexual exploitation of children is explained by the DOJ-OOC as due to “the fact that during the enhanced community quarantine, strict quarantine is observed in all households, and internet usage surges as people stay home.”  The Child Rights Network (CRN), which counts 44 organizations and agencies across the country, has called for an “all-out war” against OSEC, with CRN convener Romeo Dongeto saying it is necessary to “resolutely shut down these hideous acts committed against children.” In a statement, the CRN posits that “with the widening availability of internet connection in the Philippines, and with the ECQ prompting children to spend more time online, sexual predators find it easier to prey on children.” To be sure, the concerned government agencies have begun moving against those involved in this sickening trade. Last March 11, the DOJ-OCC met with internet service providers (ISPs) to “remind” them of their duties to install “available technology, program or software to ensure that access or transmittal of any form of child pornography would be blocked or filtered pursuant to… the Anti-Child Pornography Act of 2009.” Eleven years after the passage of this law, however, says the DOJ-OOC, “ISP companies continue to be remiss in their duties.” It reminded these companies that protecting Filipino children and blocking child pornography are part of the requirements for ISP companies to retain their franchises.  There have been movements in other fields, too. Last April 22, a woman suspected of engaging in cybersex trafficking of minors, including her own children, was arrested by police. Rescued by law enforcers were seven children, all but one of them male, ages 3 to 14, with four of them the suspect’s own children. This was the second police operation against an OSEC enterprise; the previous raid was conducted with support from the United States Homeland Security Investigations and the IJM. Last May 26, David Timothy Deakin, 55, became the first foreigner to be convicted of trafficking offenses through online proceedings in the country, the IJM said. Deakin was sentenced to life imprisonment and was ordered to pay a fine of P2 million in addition to paying each of his victims P500,000 representing moral damages, and an additional P100,000 as exemplary damages as civil indemnity for his crimes. Still, much remains to be done. Surveillance and monitoring of internet operations involved in OSEC will have to be stepped up, including the prosecution of ISPs found to have been hosting such activities. But we cannot stop at mere law enforcement and prosecution. Filipinos—as a society and as individuals, especially as parents—need to look deep into their hearts and child-rearing practices to understand why children remain vulnerable to exploitation by the adults in their lives. We need to correct the social expectation that children are the mere property of their elders, to be disciplined, exploited, and victimized as the adults wish.

5;OVAC;Study: Philippines a global hot spot for online child abuse;Associated Press;Associated Press;Thu, 21 May 2020 15:53:13 PST;article;"MANILA, Philippines — The Philippines has emerged as a global hot spot for online child sexual exploitation, and coronavirus lockdowns that restrict millions to their homes may be worsening the abuses, a U.S. official said Thursday. A new study released by the Washington-based International Justice Mission on Thursday said Philippine cases of online child sexual exploitation have increased sharply in recent years with parents conniving to have their own children victimized for the money. The non-governmental group has helped track down and prosecute offenders in the Philippines.  “The global shutdown with the COVID-19 pandemic seems to only be increasing these phenomena,” U.S. State Department official John Richmond, who oversees U.S. efforts to combat human trafficking, said in an online launch of the study.

The Philippines has emerged as a global hot spot for online child sexual exploitation, and coronavirus lockdowns that restrict millions to their homes may be worsening the abuses, a U.S. official said Thursday, May 21, 2020. (AP Photo/Aaron Favila, File) In most cases “the traffickers are actually parents or close family members of the kids they are exploiting,” Richmond said. “And so lockdown orders mean that children are being locked down with their traffickers.”  The webcam scheme has involved pedophiles in the U.S., Canada, Europe, and Australia who pay facilitators to sexually abuse children, even babies, in the privacy of Philippine homes. They watch and help direct the abuses through online live streaming services. The wide use of English, availability of internet connections, and widespread international cash transfer systems have combined with long-entrenched poverty and wide access to vulnerable kids to allow many abuses to happen in the Philippines.  Citing online tips on abuses, the study said the estimated number of Internet Protocol addresses used for online child sexual exploitation in the Philippines rose sharply from about 23,333 in 2014 to 81,723 in 2017 — a 250% increase. An IP address identifies a computer connected to the internet.  The study showed 64% of online sexual child abuse cases in the Philippines were initiated by foreign authorities largely because of a lack of capability to detect the live-streamed abuse, which is often uncovered only when foreign law enforcers accost an offender abroad. “The tech industry should prioritize detection of all child sexual exploitation materials because of the gravity of harm that repeated sexual exploitation causes victims,” International Justice Mission Philippine Director Samson Inocencio Jr. said. “There are children who need rescue now, but rescue starts with the timely detection and robust reporting.” FILE – In this April 20, 2017, file photo, sex toys are seen on the floor of the home of an American suspected child webcam cybersex operator as investigators gather evidence during a raid at his home in Mabalacat, Philippines.

(AP Photo/Aaron Favila, File) In 90 cases involving 381 victims from 2011 to 2017, 43 victims were abused from two months to four years. The period of abuse for the others was not known, according to the study. It said victims have an average age of 11 years, with the youngest less than 1 year old. Another unsettling finding was that nearly half of the abuses were arranged by the parents or other relatives of the victims.  “We need to act as a global community – ending impunity in both source countries like the Philippines and demand countries,” Philippine Justice Undersecretary Emmeline Aglipay-Villar said.

6;OVAC;25-year-old woman in Cebu gets 17 years for child sexual abuse;No news platform;Ador Vincent Mayol;Sun, 09 Aug 2020 14:45:02 PST;article;CEBU CITY – A 25-year-old woman was sentenced to a total of 17 years and six months in prison for sexually exploiting her underage female cousin and livestreaming the abuse for a paying online child sex offender. Jade (not her real name) pleaded guilty to attempted trafficking, possession of child sexual exploitation materials (CSEM), and child abuse before Judge Christine Muga-Abad of the Regional Trial Court Branch 70 in Lapu-Lapu City.  In a decision rendered through video conferencing, Abad also ordered Jade to pay P600,000 in fine, P500,000 in moral damages, and P100,000 in exemplary damages. Jade was arrested by members of the Philippine National Police Women and Children Protection Center – Visayas Field Unit (WCPC-VFU) on April 6 while the lockdown was in effect to contain the spread of the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Lapu-Lapu City.  Considered “children at risk,” her three children, all under seven years old, were brought to the custody of the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD). Under plea agreements, the accused pleads guilty not to the original charges but to other similar offenses usually before a court trial starts.  This protects child victims from the possibility of having to testify against perpetrators who are often family members or neighbors – a process that may cause re-traumatization, said the International Justice Mission (IJM), a non-government human rights group that combats slavery, sexual assaults on children and cybersex trafficking, in a press statement. Lawyer Lucille Dejito, IJM Cebu Field Office director, said seeking justice for victims of online sexual exploitation of children does not stop even with the ongoing pandemic. “The arrest of the trafficker and her eventual conviction happened despite the constraints posed by community quarantines. This is a testament to the tenacity of our partners in the Philippine criminal justice system in our shared goal of putting an end to this disturbing crime threatening our children. Dejito hoped that Jade’s conviction would remind those who sexually abuse children that the risk of getting caught and spending several years in prison is real and not worth taking. Based on their investigation, Jade abused her female cousin from 2016 to 2018 when the latter was aged 11 to 13.  The minor was rescued on July 31, 2019, following a case referral from the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to the Philippine Internet Crimes Against Children Center. The FBI was then investigating Alan Dennis Wolff, a U.S. based child sex offender, who paid and directed Jade to abuse her underage cousin in order to produce new child sexual exploitation materials online. In exchange for payments from Wolff, Jade livestreamed the sexual abuse of her cousin to him. Following the rescue of the victim, WCPC-VFU filed complaints against Jade for violations under Expanded Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act, Anti-Child Abuse Law and Anti-Child Pornography Act in relation to Cybercrime Prevention Act. On February 26, 2020, Judge Abad issued an arrest warrant against Jade who was arrested five weeks later. Wolff, meanwhile, pleaded guilty to two counts of sexual exploitation of children before a court in Minneapolis, Minnesota in December 2019. So far, in IJM-supported cases, 90 persons have been convicted in the Philippines for online sexual exploitation of children since 2011. IJM has supported Philippine law enforcement agencies in operations that led to the arrest of 256 persons and the rescue of 669 victims and children-at-risk across the country.;Regions;['Cebu', 'child sexual abuse', 'guilty', 'Jail', 'sentence', 'sexual exploitation'];https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1319031/25-year-old-woman-in-cebu-gets-17-years-for-child-sexual-abuse;1
7;OVAC;Child sexual abuse online up 250% in 3 years;Inquirer Visayas;Ador Vincent Mayol;Mon, 25 May 2020 04:46:21 PST;article;"CEBU CITY, Cebu, Philippines — Cases of internet-based sexual exploitation of children in the Philippines continued to go up, with eight out of every 10 perpetrators related by blood or affinity to the victims, according to a new study. The study, conducted by the International Justice Mission (IJM), found that the estimated number of internet protocol (IP) addresses used for internet-based child sexual exploitation in the country rose 250 percent from 23,333 in 2014 to 81,723 in 2017.  “The results of the study show that Osec (online sexual exploitation of children) is a growing and heinous crime,” Justice Undersecretary Emmeline Aglipay-Villar said in a statement released by the IJM. Villar is in charge of the Inter-Agency Council Against Trafficking of the Department of Justice (DOJ).  “We need to act as a global community — ending impunity in both source countries like the Philippines,’’ she said. “The Philippine government is committed to sustaining our collaboration with international law enforcement agencies in combating this threat against our children.” The IJM released on May 21 the study titled “Online Sexual Exploitation of Children in the Philippines: Analysis and Recommendations for Governments, Industry and Civil Society.”  Authorities have asked Facebook to give up data of those behind the “alarming proliferation” of pages on the social media platform that promote child pornography during the COVID-19 community quarantine. The DOJ, the National Bureau of Investigation and the Philippine National Police said the platform was being used to distribute and publish child sexual exploitation materials (CSEM) online. Certain Facebook pages with suggestive names are used to promote and facilitate exchanges of child pornography among the members, the law enforcement agencies said in a statement. The administrators and members of such Facebook pages manage to evade law enforcers by regularly changing their names and keeping the pages private. The agencies asked the public to report to law enforcement authorities goings-on on Facebook “that tend to prejudice a child’s physical, moral, spiritual, intellectual, emotional, psychological and social well-being.”Global hot spot  The IJM study, conducted from 2017 to 2019, stated that the Philippines was a “global hot spot” for children’s abuse online. It examined 90 cases that were investigated between 2011 and 2017, involving 381 victims. Among the 43 victims for whom the exact length of abuse was known, the average length of abuse was two years, ranging from two months to four years. An analysis of victim profiles showed that the median age was only 11, with the youngest less than 1 year old. Another unsettling finding, IJM said, was that 41 percent of the abuses were facilitated by biological parents and 42 percent by other relatives—or at least 83 percent by people related to child victims. The study, however, was unable to measure the prevalence of Osec—a subset of internet-based child sexual exploitation—due to inconsistencies in the quality of reporting by electronic service providers (ESPs) and because ESPs are not currently detecting livestreamed abuse. Since technology was yet to be developed or deployed by ESPs to detect livestreamed abuse, the IJM said it was often uncovered only when a foreign law enforcement agency identified an offender for a different but related offense like possession or sharing of CSEM. The study revealed that 64 percent of Philippine Osec cases were initiated by referrals from foreign authorities. “The tech industry should prioritize detection of all child sexual exploitation materials—especially newly created CSEM and livestreaming—because of the gravity of harm that repeated sexual exploitation causes victims,” IJM Philippines director Samson Inocencio Jr. said in a press statement. “There are children who need rescue now, but rescue starts with timely detection and robust reporting,” he added.

 The study recommended legislation expanding ESP reporting requirements to make CyberTipline reports more useful to law enforcement; greater international law enforcement collaboration, such as placing foreign police liaisons in source countries; and implementing child-protective measures and trauma-informed care from rescue to reintegration. It also proposed increasing Osec-dedicated staffing, budget and collaboration among law enforcement agencies, and improving collaboration in information and intelligence-sharing, measurement and data collection and research on Osec. The study was made in partnership with the government, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and other concerned parties under the US-Philippines Child Protection Compact Partnership between the US Department of State’s Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons and the Philippine government. —WITH A REPORT FROM DONA Z.

8;OVAC;More boys suffer online sex abuse than thought – study;Agence France-Presse;Agence France-Presse;Wed, 07 Mar 2018 07:50:54 PST;article; BRUSSELS, Belgium — Boys account for nearly a third of online child sex abuse images and often suffer the worst horrors, a new study revealed Tuesday, suggesting a greater problem than first thought.  Interpol and Ecpat, a Bangkok-based international organization fighting child sexual abuse, produced the findings after reviewing more than one million online images and videos. “There is sort of a higher number than we would have maybe thought of males portrayed on the images,” Ecpat’s Marie-Laure Lemineur told a press conference in Brussels.  The report said 64.8 percent of the unidentified victims were girls and 31.1 percent were boys while both sexes were depicted together in 4.1 percent of images and videos. “When boys were depicted in the abuse, it was more likely to be severe,” the report said.  The report added that the younger the child, whether a boy or a girl, the “abuse was more likely to be severe.”  The findings are important and require further study because it is often assumed that girls and older children are far more likely to be abused than boys and young children, Ecpat and Interpol officials said. Some of the victims were infants and toddlers. The study rated levels of victimization from cases of nudity, erotic posing, explicit sexual activity, assault, gross assault as well as sadism and bestiality. Bjorn Sellstrom, Interpol’s coordinator for crimes against children, urged the public to be careful about the terms used to describe the abuses.  “This is not child pornography. This is evidence of crimes,” the Swedish police officer told the press conference. The images were contained in the International Child Sexual Exploitation database that Interpol set up nearly a decade ago, leading to the identification of 12,000 victims. But Sellstrom said many more could be identified as less than half of the world’s countries are connected to the data base, with none in Africa and only a few in Asia. The system’s sophisticated software compares photos and videos, allowing investigators to also identify abusers and locations across the participating member states. Nearly 47 percent of the files in the database portray child victims that have been identified by the authorities while the remainder depict unidentified children. Interpol and Ecpat called for a coordinated global response involving civil society, media, academia and various layers of government. “This is not a law enforcement problem. This is a societal problem,” Sellstrom said. /cbb;Internet;['Child Abuse', 'Child Pornography', 'Ecpat', 'Internet', 'Interpol', 'Online', 'technology'];https://technology.inquirer.net/73347/technology-online-internet-child-abuse-interpol-ecpat-child-pornography;1

10;OVAC;Is PH internet safe?;No news platform;Marjohara Tucay;Tue, 11 Feb 2020 04:03:53 PST;article;Is the Philippine internet safe? No, it isn’t.  Today, the Philippines is observing “Safer Internet Day for Children,” by virtue of Proclamation No. 417 issued by President Duterte in 2018. First introduced in 2004 by several European countries, the observance has now spread to over 100 countries, with the aim of raising awareness about online issues faced by children, and on a wider scale, about digital security. The government’s theme for Safer Internet Day this year — “Responsableng paggamit ng Internet, sana all” — sounds quite hollow in light of the recent commotion at the Department of Information and Communications Technology. Undersecretary Eliseo Rio Jr.’s resignation was linked to a Jan. 20 Commission on Audit observation memorandum that revealed that, in three instances last year, the department advanced P300 million in cash for “confidential expenses.” The eventual issuance of a joint statement by Rio and DICT Secretary Gregorio Honasan II, noting that Rio “never mentioned any anomaly in the disbursement of the Confidential Expense of the DICT,” only stokes the fires of suspicion.  Why, in the first place, does the DICT have funds for confidential expenses? The budget books define confidential funds as the budget for surveillance activities “in civilian departments and agencies.” Is the government spying on its people over the internet? With the very department that should be at the forefront of digital security being annually appropriated hundreds of millions in confidential funds, the answer is most probably “Yes.”The DICT’s multimillion-peso allotment should also be looked into for another thing—whether it is the source of funding for the long-suspected employment of “astroturfing,” or the maintenance of online trolls by the government to sway public opinion. The government has likewise been linked to more insidious cyberattacks in previous years, including the use of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks to silence critical independent media that mainly rely on the internet for distribution. Beyond the anxiety-provoking thought of state forces spying on everything you type in cyberspace, we can assess the digital security landscape in the Philippines by zeroing in on how state forces are protecting — or rather, neglecting — the most vulnerable sector of society using the internet: children. According to the Child Rights Network, about one in five Filipino children are susceptible to online sexual abuse in one form or another.  While there are existing Philippine laws on protecting internet users, especially children, from online abuse, stark gaps remain. The Philippines has yet to have an all-encompassing law covering the full range of online sexual exploitation of children (Osec), greatly hindering the prosecution of perpetrators and the delivery of justice to child victims. Existing laws also do not punish Osec attempts, only successful, consummated acts. Even the policing of internet service providers and private actors, such as banks and other financial institutions where payments for online sexual services are coursed through, remains inadequate.  Such failures underline why the government’s call this day for the responsible use of the internet by everyone should, first of all, be directed at itself. * * * Marjohara Tucay is a child rights advocate and is part of the national secretariat of Altermidya Network, a national alliance of alternative and community media organizations.;Columnists;['Commentary', 'DICT', 'Eliseo Rio Jr.', 'Gregorio Honasan II', 'Gringo Honasan', 'intel funds', 'marjohara tucay', 'online sexual exploitation of children', 'Philippine internet', 'Safe Internet Day'];https://opinion.inquirer.net/127294/is-ph-internet-safe;2
11;OVAC;Child rights group to gov’t: Implement laws, policies to protect children from online sexual abuse;INQUIRER.net;Consuelo Marquez;Tue, 11 Feb 2020 21:01:17 PST;article;MANILA, Philippines — Save the Children Philippines appealed to the government to implement laws and policies that would protect children from online sexual abuse and exploitation. The child rights group discovered that according to the Philippine government’s National Baseline Study on Violence against Children, one in two Filipino children experience online abuse while one in four is being exposed to sexually explicit content.  “The government should pass and implement laws and policies that would protect children from OSAEC (Online Sexual Abuse and Exploitation of Children), have prevention programs and accessible services for children and their families, implement widespread information dissemination on OSAEC, and prosecute those who are exploiting our children and women through the use of information, communication technologies,” lawyer Albert Muyot, chief executive officer of Save the Children Philippines, said in a statement. Muyot also underscored that the  Internet Service Providers and business owners who operate internet shops should establish safety measures to ensure protection of children from online exploitation.  Another child expert in Save the Philippines also asked parents to educate their children on responsible usage of the internet to prevent online exploitation. “The family should provide the first layer of protection for children. A good relationship between parents and their children will ensure that they will listen to their parent’s advice, and that the parent can respectfully monitor their children’s use of the internet,” Wilma Bañaga, Child Protection Advisor of Save the Children, said.  The National Baseline Study on Violence against Children also showed that 29 percent of children have been receiving sexual messages and some three percent of children said they sent nude images or videos of their sexual activities on the internet.;Nation;['Albert Muyot', 'child rights group', 'Nation', 'online sexual abuse and exploitation of children\xa0', 'Save the Children Philippines'];https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1227417/child-rights-group-to-govt-implement-laws-policies-to-protect-children-from-online-sexual-abuse;2
12;OVAC;Bong Go files twin bills to combat increasing cases of child sexual abuse in the country;INQUIRER.net;INQUIRER.net;Sat, 11 Jul 2020 17:10:28 PST;article;Photo from Senator Bong Go’s office Senator Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go filed a measure to amend Republic Act No. 7610 or the “Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation, and Discrimination Act” which will enhance the country’s protective measures against child sexual abuse. Senate Bill No. 1650 seeks to amend Section 5 (b) of the Anti-Child Abuse Law regarding the penalty for persons engaging in lascivious conduct or sexual activity with minors under twelve years of age. The proposed amendment will increase the penalty to reclusion temporal in its medium period to reclusion perpetua for any individual found violating the law under said provision.  Under the present law, lascivious acts against a minor below twelve years are penalized with reclusion temporal in its medium period whilst the same act committed against a child above twelve years but below eighteen years of age is penalized with reclusion temporal in its medium period to reclusion perpetua. In other words, the penalty is lower despite the fact that the victim is younger. Go also cited a 2019 Supreme Court case, People v. Tulagan, which called for “corrective legislation” to address the incongruent penalties.  “Mariin po nating tinututulan ang pang-aabuso sa ating mga kabataan. Kaya naman po isinusulong ko ang panukalang ito sa Senado upang masiguro na protektado ang ating mga kabataan laban sa mga ganitong pang-aabuso,” Go said. “Ang mga kabataan po ang pag-asa ng ating bayan. Gawin po natin ang lahat upang proteksyunan sila laban sa mga taong may masamang intensyon sa kanila,” he continued.  The United Nations estimates tens of thousands of children have fallen victim to the global child-abuse industry, now worth over US$ 1 billion. The Philippines, in particular, is the largest known source of Online Sexual Exploitation of Children (OSEC) cases according to a recent study conducted by the Washington-based International Justice Mission in partnership with the Philippine and United States governments. The number of cases increased by 250% from 23,333 in 2014 to 81,723 in 2017. It is believed the widespread use of the English language, high poverty incidence rate and relatively easy internet access have enabled the crime to worsen in the country. OSEC is predominantly a family-based crime. The average age of the victims is eleven years. The youngest documented victim is less than one year. Seventy four percent of the local cases were facilitated by someone within the child’s circle of trust, such as a family member, guardian or family friend. The parents, if not traffickers themselves, sometimes get involved as they too share in the financial benefits obtained from the exploitation of the child. It is suggested that money, as opposed to sexual deviancy, is the primary motivator. An official of the U.S. State Department disclosed the number of OSEC cases in the Philippines is swiftly rising partly due to the economic downturn as a result of COVID-19 pandemic. The pedophiles are mostly in the United States, Canada, Europe and Australia. Many have either travelled or lived in the Philippines at some point in time. As a consequence, the Senator also filed another bill, SB No. 1649, to reduce the risk of such crimes occurring.  The Bureau of Immigration Modernization Act of 2019 aims to update the Philippines’ outdated immigration system.

13;OVAC;Safer Internet Day: Unicef calls for urgent measures to protect kids online;INQUIRER.net;Julius N. Leonen;Wed, 14 Feb 2018 16:39:59 PST;article;INQUIRER.net stock image Every half a second, a child goes online for the first time, and the United Nations Children’s Fund (Unicef) is urging the world to implement measures to protect them from “the perils of the digital world.” The Unicef, in a statement on Wednesday, noted that more than 175,000 children go online for the first time each day.  In a study conducted in 2017, the Unicef found that while one in three internet users is a child, but “too little is done” to safeguard the trail of information children’s online activities create, and to increase their access to safe and quality online content. “Every day, thousands of children are going online for the first time, which opens them up to a flood of dangers we are just coming to appreciate, let alone address,” said Laurence Chandy, Unicef Director of Data, Research and Policy.  Despite the “wealth of benefits and opportunities” of the digital world, Chandy said it may expose children to harmful content such as sexual exploitation and abuse, cyberbullying, and misuse of their private information. “While governments and the private sector have made some progress in formulating policies and approaches to eliminate the most egregious online risks, more effort must be made to fully understand and protect children’s online lives,” he said.  While it made clear that the obligation to protect children in the internet was on everyone, the Unicef noted the responsibility “has not been taken seriously enough” by the private sector.  “The power and influence of the private sector should be leveraged to advance industry-wide ethical standards on data and privacy, as well as other practices that benefit and protect children online,” Chandy said. The Unicef then urged the world to put children at the center of digital policy by coordinating a global, regional and national response to conceal illegal trafficking and other online child sexual abuse online. The organization also urged the private sector and government to commit to protect and not misuse children’s data collected online. The latter was also urged to teach children how to protect themselves from threats to their own privacy. Children must also be taught how to keep themselves informed, engaged and safe online through bolstered digital literacy from primary school to high school, the Unicef added.  “In the time it takes to click on a link, a child somewhere begins creating a digital trail which those not necessarily considering the child’s best interest can follow and potentially exploit,” Chandy said. “As younger and younger children join the Internet, the need to have a serious discussion about how to keep them safe online and secure their digital footprint becomes increasingly urgent,” he added. /jpv RELATED STORY 8 of 10 Filipino children risk online sexual abuse–Unicef;Internet;['digital', 'Internet day', 'Online', 'tech', 'UNICEF'];https://technology.inquirer.net/72567/safer-internet-day-unicef-calls-urgent-measures-protect-kids-online-internet-day-unicef-online-tech-digital;2
14;OVAC;Getting away with child exploitation;Philippine Daily Inquirer;Hyacinth Tagupa;Fri, 29 May 2020 04:20:26 PST;article;"As early as April, various advocacy groups have warned that the online sexual abuse of children could increase during the COVID-19 quarantine period. True enough, the Philippine Department of Justice revealed on Monday that reports of online sexual exploitation of children in the country surged by 264 percent between March 1 and May 24.  Perpetrators of child sexual abuse have exceeded expectations. Not only have their activities increased in frequency, they have also become much bolder. They are now on Facebook and Twitter, the two most widely used social networks in the country. If before, we thought of child exploitation as a heavily concealed underbelly of the internet, relegated only to the dark corners of the deep web and accessible only through highly furtive networks, these days, the sick explicit content can be found with just a simple hashtag.  Separate investigative reports from Esquire Philippines and Rappler spotlight an array of Facebook groups where child pornography is offered, and Twitter hashtags that lead to explicit material being sold for as low as P100. No need for specialized dark web software or private links to obscure websites. The exchanges are on everyday social media, clear as day.  This begs the question: Why are online child abusers getting away with it so easily?  “We have a lot of laws already,” said lawyer Stephanie Tan of the Children’s Legal Bureau during a symposium. “What we really need is the implementation.” Indeed, we already have the Cybercrime Prevention Act (Republic Act No. 10175), the Special Protection of Children Against Child Abuse Act (RA 7610), and the Anti-Violence Against Women and Their Children Act (RA 9262), to name a few. But despite these laws, the thriving community of child abusers on social media is proof that little has been done to deter them, much less bring them to justice. Considering that the sexual abuse of children is not a new issue in the country, it’s frustrating how slowly and feebly our law enforcement bares its teeth.  A recent study from the International Justice Mission even found that majority—64 percent—of online child sexual abuse cases in the Philippines were initiated by foreign authorities because ours lacked detection capability. An obvious mitigating strategy that’s been brought up over and over is for the tech industry to step up. Internet service providers and social networks are called on to strengthen their content filtering and reporting mechanisms (which are already in place—just not fast enough or precise enough, it seems). Doing so would likely earn them the ire of some who would play the “free speech” card. But the sexual abuse and exploitation of children is no longer an issue of free speech. It is a crime, and it ought to be reported to the authorities. However, stopping this “secret pandemic” of abuse is not solely the responsibility of tech companies. It is a multifaceted issue of technology, poverty, education, and human rights awareness. It is crucial to note that among the top perpetrators of child sexual abuse are their own family members who resort to peddling minors to alleviate their household’s financial situation. As a result, the abuse becomes normalized to the children themselves. Writing for The Guardian in 2016, Oliver Holmes gave us a gut-wrenching portrait of Filipino children who were cybersexually exploited. He revealed how the children were “entangled in their own abuse,” sometimes even instigating their own livestream “shows” since they saw that that was how their family got money. The sexual abuse of children online is therefore a challenge not just to the technology industry, but also to educators, social workers, mental health professionals, and economic policymakers. It will take a lot of careful work to mitigate the conditions that lead to abuse, and to delicately untangle the long-term harm it creates in the young. It is also a challenge for us, netizens, to be watchful and unafraid to speak up. To report pages, groups, or content that foster online sexual abuse and exploitation of children, we can contact:

15;OVAC;A dark reality for Filipino children;Philippine Daily Inquirer;Gideon Cauton and Gideon Lasco;Tue, 18 Jun 2019 05:04:27 PST;article;"Still euphoric over the previous day’s outing to the mall, May, a 10-year-old girl, is awakened by the sharp nudges of Mercy, her 24-year-old mother, at 5 o’clock in the morning. She adjusts her eyes to the dark room lit by the computer screen. “Maghahanda na po, ma (I will get ready now, mom),” she responds. As she gets up from their futon bed, she is careful not to awaken her younger sister, so she tiptoes around the laptop, careful not to trip at the power cord. As she splashes her face with cold water, a sense of dread descends when she remembers that today she would perform another sex show for Joe — a 50-year-old white man living in a Western country.  Shocking as it seems, May’s experience is by no means isolated. In 2014, the Department of Justice (DOJ) received 1,000 referrals each month of online sexual exploitation of children (Osec) — or the livestreaming of sexual exploitation of children through the internet. In the first four months of 2015, the cases doubled to more than 2,000 monthly cases all over the Philippines. With the internet becoming more widespread, this upward trend is only expected to continue unless critical government intervention is made. To understand the problem, we need to look at the mechanisms of Osec, and the profile both of the victims and perpetrators. Osec usually involves a foreign customer based in another country, a Filipino facilitator who has access to children, and the children themselves. In exchange for payment, the facilitator offers the live sexual exploitation of a child to the customer, who is actively prowling the internet for children.  Facilitators are economically motivated, but like Mercy, many start off with what they thought would be a romantic relationship with the foreign customer. In Mercy’s case, what she thought was true love from Joe turned into a pay-per-view transaction for online sex shows. Such acts are punishable under a myriad of laws protecting the rights of children.  Foremost of these is Republic Act No. 10364, the Expanded Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2012. However, what makes Osec particularly difficult is that, per available data from International Justice Mission, almost 60 percent of these facilitators are the victims’ parents, relatives, close friends or neighbors.  More than half of the victims rescued are 12 years old or younger; the youngest thus far is a 2-month-old baby. Sometimes, children are made to perform sexual acts with their parents or siblings. As with other forms of child sexual abuse, Osec can lead to physical and mental health issues, difficult sexual adjustment later on, and lifelong trauma.  Surely, many would find it difficult to believe that parents can do this form of violence to their children. The shocking nature of this reality, however, should not lead to denial. While, to their credit, various law enforcement agencies are already working on this issue (and also coordinating with foreign governments to deal with the all-important demand side), a more coordinated and collaborative public justice response is needed, with a victim-centric approach at its core. Specifically, we need more officers assigned at the Philippine National Police Women and Children Protection Center and at the National Bureau of Investigation Anti-Human Trafficking in Persons Division exclusively investigating Osec cases. These operational units need to be properly resourced. Collaborative initiatives between these units and foreign law enforcement such as the Philippine Internet Crimes Against Children Center, envisioned to be a center of excellence for combating Osec, need to be strengthened. Similarly, strategic investments should be done with prosecution development in the DOJ and aftercare development in the Department of Social Welfare and Development. Crucially, measures should be explored to minimize the trauma of the victims at every stage of the process, and to understand the socioeconomic contexts that inform these practices and the “local moral worlds” that surround them. Finally, we need to raise public awareness on this matter, in a way that does not lead to a “moral panic” but to a moral response, which can then lead to stronger action from other sectors—the academe and the media, religious and civic groups, nongovernment organizations and local government units.  Everyday, thousands of Filipino children suffer sexual violence at the hands of the very persons who are supposed to care for them. This is a dark reality the country must acknowledge and act on, now. * * * Gideon Cauton, a lawyer, is the director of investigations and law enforcement development at International Justice Mission, a nonprofit organization focused on human rights, law and law enforcement.

16;OVAC;AP Exclusive: Big child webcam sex bust reveals rising abuse;Associated Press;Jim Gomez, Martha Mendoza;Tue, 09 May 2017 13:22:16 PST;article;"In this photo, taken April 20, 2017, a Filipino member of the National Bureau of Investigation takes a picture of the computer of suspected child webcam cybersex operator, David Timothy Deakin, from Peoria, Illinois, during a raid at his home in Mabalacat, Philippines. Deakin’s arrest reveals one of the darkest corners of the internet, where pedophiles in the US, Canada, Europe and Australia pay facilitators on the other side of the world to sexually abuse children, directing their moves through online livestreaming services. (Photo by AARON FAVILA / AP) First published: 12:27 p.m., May 9, 2017 MABALACAT, Pampanga — The suspected pedophile could see people banging on his front door through his security cameras. Were they neighbors? Cops?  One had letters on her jacket. As David Timothy Deakin googled “What is NBI?” from the laptop on his bed, the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) smashed their way into his cybersex den. Children’s underwear, toddler shoes, cameras, bondage cuffs, fetish ropes, meth pipes and stacks of hard drives and photo albums cluttered the stuffy, two-bedroom townhouse. Penciled on the wall, someone had scrawled “My Mom and Dad love me” and a broken heart. In his computer were videos and images of young boys and girls engaged in sex acts.  “Why is everyone asking about children coming into my house?” said Deakin, 53, his wrists bound with a zip tie. Deakin’s arrest April 20 reveals one of the darkest corners of the internet, where pedophiles in the US, Canada, Europe and Australia pay facilitators on the other side of the world to sexually abuse children, even babies, directing their moves through online livestreaming services.  The relatively new crime of webcam sex tourism is spreading rapidly, with new digital technologies sparking what the United Nations calls an “alarming growth of new forms of child sexual exploitation online.” The FBI says it’s epidemic, and that at any given moment, 750,000 child predators are online.  Almost every case stems from the Philippines, where good English speakers, increased internet connections and widespread international cash transfer systems combine with widespread poverty and easy access to vulnerable kids. There have been as many as three busts a week there this spring. The youngest victim ever, rescued a few weeks ago, was an infant, two months old. Most are under 12. This spring The Associated Press watched a raid, rescue and launch of a major investigation that continues to play out on both sides of the world. “This should serve as a warning,” said NBI Anti-human trafficking chief Janet Francisco, who leads the case. “We will really catch them, with the help of our foreign counterparts. We will really put them in jail and they will die in jail.” * * *  Bare-chested and slick with sweat, his breath sour and glasses foggy, Deakin watched agents — including FBI computer analysts — crouch on his bed over open computers, rushing to find and preserve hidden files. The tip that led authorities to Deakin came, as they often do, when an online international money transfer service notified an American internet provider about a suspicious account. Western Union, PayPal, and others have reported concerns in the past — business names in this case are being withheld because of the ongoing investigation. Records in Deakin’s town house included debit cards for money transfer services, including Smart Money and Payoneer. The raid began just before dawn, as seven vanloads of police, investigators, lawyers and social workers rolled out of Manila, past rice paddies and water buffalos, and into a town that was once a large U.S. military base, now a major red light district. The vans passed Fields Avenue, a notorious street lined with bars, strip clubs and massage parlors; shops advertise Viagra and lingerie-clad women beckon customers. When they reached Deakin’s apartment, a small cadre went to his door. Even as they burst in, he was streaming illicit content through the Tor network, which disguised his identity. Agents said he had a webpage open to wipe his phone clean. They tied him up with the first thing they could grab, an iPhone charging cord, before he could hit the button. “I’m a file pack rat,” said Deakin. “I’ve got files of frigging everything.” AP and investigators asked him repeatedly why he had images of children engaged in sexual acts on his computer and bondage and fetish tools in his apartment. “I’m just a costumer,” he said at first, as if the leather wrist restraints and ropes in the second bedroom were just for dress-up. “I’m schizophrenic, you know,” he later told AP, looping his finger at his temple. He described a series of houseguests, people he let crash in his small place from down the street, other countries. Perhaps “some Danish guy” used his computer. And this: “There was no children in front of the cam in my house, not even dressed, as far as I know, not even with their frigging mothers as far as I know.”

 At one point, he told AP the images might have inadvertently slipped in when he downloaded massive files using BitTorrent. BitTorrent is data tool used legitimately by academics and artists, but also by child pornographers and other criminals because large amounts of digital content can be moved and sorted. FBI agents looking for abusers search BitTorrent to spot people sharing exploitive images. Hours after his arrest, wrists tied behind his back, Deakin grew nervous. “I don’t even know what you’re frigging doing here!” he yelled. * * * Deakin grew up in Peoria, Illinois, he said, “around the corn fields.” His family was splintered, his sister hated him and he didn’t finish high school, he said. He was licensed as a roofing contractor in his 30s, seasonal work which left winters free; he used the time to study computers. Illinois court records show Deakin was arrested on marijuana and drunken driving charges several times before visiting the Philippines in 1998. Two years later, he moved there for a job setting up internet service providers and installing Blackmagic livestreaming production programs. “The office computers were full of pornography,” Deakin would write to Filipino authorities three years later, when an inter-office argument led to immigration charges. The charges were dismissed, and he was supposed to leave the country. But he stayed, remotely running computer systems for clients around the world, and hosting, he said, tens of thousands of websites as well. In recent years, Deakin said, he earned $30 an hour as a systems administrator. But his home was filled with junk, his refrigerator near empty. Stacks of used egg cartons fell from the shelves, and a half-eaten pot of cold rice sat on the stove. “You know what you’ve done in this room,” an investigator told Deakin. She showed him a photo he had of several children. Shrugging, he said one of them was probably a few doors away with her cousin. Minutes later, two girls, 9 and 11 years old, were rescued by police.

 AP did not interview the girls Deakin told police about; victims of such raids need immediate and long-term counseling and care. But in the tranquil garden of a shelter for sexual exploitation survivors about 60 miles south of Deakin’s town house, 19-year-old Cassie described her ordeal. AP did not use her whole name to protect her privacy. The youngest daughter in an impoverished family of 14, Cassie believed the man who came to her village and promised her a better life and family support if she would go to the city with him. When he told her he would be selling her, she had no idea what that meant. “I was laughing,” she said. Cassie was 12. Within months the man bleached her dark skin, straightened her hair, and began waking her at 4 a.m. to meet customers. She started working as a cybersex model. “He needed some girl to show her whole body in front of the camera,” she said. He told her it was her job, in exchange for an education. Over time, six more girls came to live in the house, and one had a baby. At school Cassie tried to act normal, hiding her secret from classmates. At home she was terrified and thinking about suicide. The abuse ended when her older sister found out. Furious, she went to the police. Dolores Rubia, who runs aftercare programs for rescued girls through Washington DC-based NGO International Justice Mission , said parents and relatives turn to online exploitation for easy money. Some consider it benign, she said, because they think children don’t mind taking off their clothes. But that exposure is abuse, and it often escalates.

 “It’s a myth for some of them, that nothing is wrong,” she said. “That anyway, these children are not physically touched and the perpetrators are actually overseas.” Buyers abroad also sometimes try to use the lack of contact as an excuse for their crimes. “The people I was talking to were hurting people, hurting children in a way that I would never have allowed in my presence,” said Scott Peeler, a former Southbridge, Massachussetts middle school math teacher who admitted he tried to buy live video feeds of children having sex in the Philippines. “I drifted into a world that repulses me,” he said. Peeler was sentenced in March to 11 ½ years in federal prison. “It’s not just a virtual crime. It is an actual crime,” said human rights attorney Sam Inocencio, who heads International Justice Mission’s Philippines office, which supports local law enforcement with investigators and attorneys. “Online sexual exploitation is possibly the most evil thing that I’ve seen.” * * * The first high-profile international case of livestreaming sexual exploitation of children was reported in 2011 out of the Philippines. The proliferation of smart phones and wi-fi have led to rapid growth. Perpetrators now use bitcoin or untraceable credit cards. By livestreaming, they bypass digital markers law enforcement embeds in illegal content to catch people downloading, sharing or saving child pornography on computers or in the Cloud. Once isolated, pedophiles now operate with virtual anonymity, sharing images and children, say experts. In 2013, online sex exploitation of children gained global attention after researchers at the Netherlands-based nonprofit Terre des Hommes launched a realistic-looking animation of a 10-year-old Filipino girl named Sweetie. They took the fake girl on chat groups and online forums. Pedophiles swarmed. In 10 weeks, analysts identified 1,000 men in 71 countries who had tried to get illegal images.

 Last year, UK-based Internet Watch Foundation worked to remove 57,335 URLs with child sexual abuse imagery. The websites were hosted on 2,416 domains, up from 1,991 in 2015. The proliferation of crimes, along with new mandatory reporting, led to 8.2 million reports last year to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children’s CyberTipline related to online child sexual exploitation. That compares with 8.3 million reports in the 17 years prior. One of those reports led analysts to a four-time convicted sex offender, Louis Francis Bradley, 66, of Baltimore, Maryland, last year. He had paid at least 17 people in the Philippines to take sexually explicit photos of prepubescent girls and share them with him on Facebook. He also admitted in March to paying women to expose their genitals using video streaming programs. “can u get any really young girls,” he asked in one online chat. Bradley was sentenced May 2 to 35 years in prison. Because it’s a newer crime, legal systems grapple with how to prosecute. In the US, the buyers are typically charged with possessing, distributing or producing child pornography. In the Philippines, it’s a human trafficking crime. In 2015, five people were convicted of online child sex trafficking in the Philippines. Deakin has been charged with cybercrime, child pornography, child abuse and child trafficking. Officials at both ends of the abuse agree they need to collaborate to stop it, and last month the US committed $3 million. Chief Supt. Liborio Carabbacan, chief of the Women and Children Protection Center of the Philippine National Police (PNP), said they were trying to raise public awareness, letting parents and children know it’s illegal. One woman forced into prostitution as a child turned the cameras on her own kids when she grew up, he said. “She thought that’s already the norm,” he said. * * *

 Deakin’s bust turned out to be one of the largest seizures of its kind in the Philippines, and also a first for investigators on the case who caught the suspect in the act. His Cherry Mobile Touch HD tablet — which can be wiped clean and reset with a four digit code — had more than 4,000 contacts. One computer had another 13 networked into it, from servers he said around the world. There were 30 hard drives. “The suspect is really a highly technical person, he is computer savvy, so he was able to hide several computers within the computer,” said Chief Francisco. Investigators hope digital forensics will lead them to rescue dozens, possibly hundreds, of victims. And they expect to catch more conspirators in the wider syndicate, both in the Philippines and abroad. Neighbors who gathered to watch the raid knew something was wrong in that house. “No, no, not drugs,” said a man who rolled up on a bike. “Computers. Sex. Children.” Josue Santos, who patrols the neighborhood on foot, said he saw seven children, 3 boys and 4 girls, heading into Deakin’s home one evening a few months ago. Others nodded. Bessie Geronimo, across the street, was teary-eyed. She’d seen children going in and out. Now, she wondered, could she have intervened? “How could they do such a thing?” she asked. “Oh, I pity those children.” Authorities from a village police substation said a housekeeper filed a complaint against Deakin last year: he wasn’t paying her, she said, and she was worried about what he was doing with children in the bedroom with the door closed. They visited his house but had no authority for a raid. “There are many such places,” said security officer Mike Wood.

 Before Deakin was taken to jail, he asked for a cigarette. He asked to use the bathroom. He asked for his Bible. And he said he’d been planning to leave town. Just one day earlier, he had texted a friend: “I’ve got to get out of here.”/rga In this April 20, 2017, photo, suspected child webcam cybersex operator, David Timothy Deakin, from Peoria, Ill., with his hands tied behind his back during a raid by investigators, sits on his bed where he handles online sharing of videos of children engaging in sexual acts in Mabalacat, Philippines.

17;OVAC;DOJ to telcos: Help us block child porn sites;Philippine Daily Inquirer;Tarra Quismundo;Thu, 30 Oct 2014 04:25:00 PST;article;Justice Secretary Leila de Lima MANILA, Philippines–To protect children from online sexual abuse, the Department of Justice (DOJ) is working to block online porn—with the help of telecommunications firms. Concerned about the “alarming” increase in cases of Filipino children falling prey to online sexual predators, the justice department aims to partner with Internet service providers to install an at-source filter that would block sites with child sexual abuse content.  “We’re coming up with a filtering software… [but] because of the volume (of child sex abuse content), it is not humanly possible to do it. So it has to be something that’s automated, an available algorithm that if it shows certain banned sites worldwide, that site should not be accessed,” said Assistant Secretary Geronimo Sy, head of the DOJ’s cybercrime office. Sy noted, however, that none of the telecommunications firms are cooperating with the DOJ in the program.  “They (telcos) cannot say that, oh, ‘we just provide the network, whatever happens in terms of content, we no longer have control.’ That’s not true… There’s no reason why you allow that (child pornography) to pass through your system. It’s like you just provide a bulletin board and whatever is put there, you no longer have any say. That’s not right,” Sy told reporters on Wednesday. Sy said he expects the telecom firms to comply “anytime now” and for the filter to go live within the next six months as the National Telecommunications Commission had issued the regulations to implement the system “six to eight months ago.”  “And if they still continue to hedge and not do it, we’ll have to take stronger action and make sure it happens at least within the next six to 12 months,” he said.  Sy said the Philippines could use the database compiled by the Interpol (International Criminal Police Organization) and the Europol (European Police Office), which lists all known sites where pedophiles go to access child pornography. “Technology is not an issue. Equipment is not an issue. It’s not something that’s impossible. If we want to do it, we can,” he told reporters on the sidelines of a public-private sector roundtable on curbing the incidence of child sexual abuse. Sy described the country as a net supplier of child sexual abuse content catering to online predators in mostly Western countries and other “hotspots.” “It’s an import-export issue. So if we can’t control the importer because they are abroad, at least the source we can manage,” Sy said.  Justice Secretary Leila de Lima said there are an estimated 200 cases of online child abuse in the Philippines “yearly since 2013,” citing data from the cybercrime units of the Philippine National Police and National Bureau of Investigation. Globally, the 2005 estimates of the European Commission showed that one million child sexual abuse images are being uploaded every year online, with 70 percent of victims below age 10, De Lima said. “Note that these images can be copied… potentially ad infinitum, so that the children they portray can be effectively revictimized forever, over and over again,” she said in remarks at the roundtable discussion that brought together DOJ officials, child rights advocates, information technology experts and telecom company representatives. The Philippines is one of the 54 countries in the Global Alliance against Child Sexual Abuse Online, a 2012 initiative to form a united front against child sexual abuse.;Internet;['child porn sites', 'Children', 'Department of Justice (DOJ)', 'filtering software', 'Internet'];https://technology.inquirer.net/39237/doj-to-telcos-help-us-block-child-porn-sites;2
18;OVAC;72 charged over ‘nightmare’ child porn network;Agence France-Presse;Agence France-Presse;Thu, 04 Aug 2011 15:49:53 PST;article;"WASHINGTON—US officials Wednesday unveiled charges against 72 people in their largest global probe into Internet child pornography which smashed a “nightmare” online bulletin board catering to pedophiles. The investigation launched in 2009 has led to arrests in the US, Philippines and 12 other countries of participants in Dreamboard, which had a “VIP” ranking system for members trading in graphic images and videos of adults molesting children age 12 and under, often violently, the Justice Department said.  “Dreamboard’s creators and members lived all over the world — but they allegedly were united by a disturbing belief that the sexual abuse of children is proper conduct that should not be criminalized,” Attorney General Eric Holder said. “The members of this criminal network shared a demented dream to create the preeminent online community for the promotion of child sexual exploitation, but for the children they victimized, this was nothing short of a nightmare.”  The ongoing probe has led to the arrest of 52 people in the US and 13 other countries — Canada, Denmark, Ecuador, France, Germany, Hungary, Kenya, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Qatar, Serbia, Sweden and Switzerland. Thirteen of the 52 individuals arrested have pleaded guilty, and 20 of the 72 individuals charged “remain at large and are known only by their online identities,” a Justice Department statement said.  Operation Delego “represents the largest prosecution to date in the United States of individuals who participated in an online bulletin board conceived and operated for the sole purpose of promoting child sexual abuse, disseminating child pornography and evading law enforcement,” it said.  “Dreamboard was a self-described global ‘community’ of pedophiles dedicated to the relentless victimization and exploitation of children 12 and under,” said Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer. According to the Justice Department, membership was tightly controlled by the site’s administrators, who required prospective members to upload child pornography when applying for membership. Members were then required continually to upload images of child sexual abuse in order to keep up their membership in the board, which included rules of conduct printed in English, Russian, Japanese and Spanish. Some of the children featured in the images and videos were just babies, said Holder.  “And, in many cases, the children being victimized were in obvious, and intentional, pain — even ‘in distress and crying,’ just as the rules for one area of the bulletin board mandated,” he added. All 72 of the defendants are charged with conspiring to advertise and distribute child pornography, and 50 are also charged with engaging in a child pornography enterprise. “Dreamboard members allegedly used the power and anonymity of the Internet to motivate each other to commit their horrific acts of sexual abuse of minors and trading in child pornography,” Breuer said. According to court documents, members employed a variety of methods to conceal their activities, using “screen names” and proxy servers, which can be used to reroute web traffic and disguise a user’s actual location. Dreamboard members also encouraged the use of encryption programs on their computers, which password-protect computer files to prevent law enforcement from accessing them in the event of a court-authorized search. Officials said the charges and arrests were conducted in three separate phases over the course of the operation. Four of the 13 individuals who have pleaded guilty for their roles in the conspiracy have been sentenced to prison. On May 10, Timothy Lee Gentry, 33, of Burlington, Kentucky, was sentenced to 25 years in prison; on May 31, Michael Biggs, 32, of Orlando, Florida, was sentenced to 20 years; on June 22, Michael Childs, 49, of Huntsville, Alabama, was sentenced to 30 years; and on July 14, Charles Christian, 49, of Tilton, Illinois, was sentenced to more than 22 years in prison. Operation Delego was conducted by the Justice Department with Homeland Security’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement, along with other global law enforcement agencies including Eurojust, the European Union’s Judicial Cooperation Unit and “dozens of law enforcement agencies throughout the world,” the statement said.";;['Children', 'Crime', 'Internet', 'pedophile', 'Philippines', 'Pornography'];https://globalnation.inquirer.net/8153/72-charged-over-nightmare-child-porn-network;2
19;OVAC;Globe joins civic groups in raising awareness on sexual exploitation of Filipino children online;No news platform;;Fri, 21 Feb 2020 17:16:51 PST;article; In celebration of Safer Internet Day, Globe Telecom joined civic groups Child Rights Network and Plan International in creating awareness on and stopping the online sexual exploitation of children in the Philippines.  Miguel Bermundo, Director for Globe Citizenship and Advocacy Marketing, talked about three major efforts of the company to keep the children safe during the media launch of Child Rights Network #ShutDownOSEC (Online Sexual Exploitation of Children) campaign, and Plan International’s Safer Internet Day activities attended by hundreds of students, parents and other stakeholders with the topic  “Building Resilient Online Community Against Sexual Abuse and Exploitation of Children.” “These days, many children turn to the internet when they search for information, play, and communicate with their peers. However, without proper guidance, there is now a higher danger of children being exposed to sexual solicitation, cyberbullying, lewd and violent materials,  among other disturbing content which may affect their well-being negatively,” said Bermundo.  Thus, Bermundo highlighted the Digital Thumbprint Program (DTP) for students, teachers, and parents, as a key Globe initiative to keep children well-protected once they connect to the Internet. DTP was launched in 2016 in response to the growing online abuse involving the youth.  It received Best Initiatives in Social Responsibility recognition from The Asset Corporate Awards in 2018. Through DTP, teachers and parents are trained to provide workshops to students on cyber safety and security, digital citizenship, and critical thinking.   Since it is crucial that the youth are equipped with the right information to help them make proper decisions in their daily actions in the online world, the Department of Education has adopted DTP and will be integrating the workshop modules in the values formation subject under the K-to-12 curriculum.   This way, all students nationwide will benefit from the lessons on digital citizenship and learn about the responsibilities that come with being online. Globe Director for Citizenship and Advocacy Marketing Miguel Bermundo talks about Globe’s efforts to fight abuse and exploitation of children during a panel discussion at Plan International’s Safer Internet Day celebration Globe also partnered with ABS-CBN Foundation Inc. by offering toll-free calls to Bantay Bata #163 helpline for all Globe and TM mobile phone users to make it easier and safer to report, rescue, and rehabilitate sick and abused children. Dialing the helpline also means hope for Filipino children and their families who are suffering in silence due to child abuse. Aside from the DTP workshops and Bantay Bata’s reporting helpline, Globe continues to extend mental wellness support to those falling into depression and other related mental illnesses.  Together with the Natasha Goulbourn Foundation, Globe provides toll-free calls to HOPELINE 2919 for those undergoing emotional crisis and in need of immediate assistance.  The recent National Baseline Survey on Violence Against Children (NBS VAC) in the Philippines, reported that about 2.9% of children have their own nude body or own sexual activities shown via the internet or mobile phone, 28% have been presented images of sexual activities of other people, and 35.4% have received sexually charged, negative, foul words or messages. On the other hand, the Department of Justice’s Office of Cybercrime (DOJ-OOC) reported receiving 37,715 cyber tips from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) in 2016, which grew to 45,645 in 2017, while the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) reported 172 cases of child pornography in 2017, up from 62 cases the previous year;Safety and Security;['globe', 'Safer Internet Day'];https://technology.inquirer.net/96557/globe-joins-civic-groups-in-raising-awareness-on-sexual-exploitation-of-filipino-children-online;2
20;OVAC;Australian arrested for molesting PH girls aired abuses online–NBI;Inquirer Mindanao;Bobby Lagsa;Sat, 21 Feb 2015 11:29:04 PST;article;"CAGAYAN DE ORO CITY – Fifty-one-year-old Australian national Peter Gerard Scully, who is now under the custody of the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) Northern Mindanao office, had reportedly made money by broadcasting his acts – against girls as young as one-year-old – over the Internet to clients in as far as Europe. “Scully performed sexual acts according to his client’s instructions and fantasy,” Angelito Magno, NBI director in the region, told the Inquirer late Friday.  Scully was arrested inside his rented house in Barangay in Barangay Violeta in Malaybalay City after a three-week stakeout by combined elements of the police’s Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG), local NBI operatives and from the NBI’s anti-trafficking division in Manila, representatives from the Australian and the Dutch police and operatives of the International Police (Interpol). The operation was said to be covered by the Mutual Assistance Legal Treaty (MLAT) the Philippines had signed with several countries.  Senior Supt. Alexander Tagum, the CIDG head for Northern Mindanao, said Scully had been the subject of an international investigation on human trafficking after police investigators in the Netherlands uncovered his activities on the Internet, where he broadcast his sexual intercourse with young girls. “He lured young girls into his house and gained their trusts, including false promises of sending them to school and feeding them. He performs sexual abuses on the girls and then he broadcast his activities on the Internet,” Czar Eric Nuqui, chief of the NBI’s anti-human trafficking division, said.  Tagum said many of the girls that Scully used in his operation came from this city and in Bukidnon.  Two of his victims decided to sue and the case was docketed at the Regional Trial Court Branch 37 here under Judge Jose Escobido in November 2014. The warrant issued against Scully was the one authorities had used when they arrested him on Friday, Nuqui said, although the Australian was already being long-sought due to the string of complaints against him. “We took notice of the standing warrant of arrest for Scully issued by Judge Jose Escobido of the Regional Trial court Branch 37 in November 2014,” Nuqui said. Based on the information, Magno said that Scully entered the country in 2011 and initially took base in this city.  “Although he moved places, he was very dynamic in his movements,” Magno said. Later, police authorities in the Netherlands took notice of Scully’s activities and established coordination with their Philippine and Australian counterparts and the Interpol, a Dutch policeman involved in the Australian’s arrest, said. “We were monitoring his activities from our country,” the Dutch policeman, who requested anonymity, said. When all details had been confirmed, the actual operation to arrest the Australian was conducted Friday. Nuqui said based on the evidence they gathered from the Internet, some of the sexual assaults were so severe that his victims were physically harmed. “Scully found out that what he was doing was a lucrative business and that he had clients all over Europe,” Nuqui said. He said the arresting team also recovered solid pieces of evidence against Scully, including electronic gadgets that he used in his activities. The NBI anti-cybercrime group also obtained digital copies of Scully’s alleged activities, Nuqui said. He said they were also looking into the possible culpability of the parents of the young Filipino girls, whom Scully had used in his activities. “We are still widening our investigation on the extent of the Scully’s crime and operation, if he has gained any assistance here in the perpetration of his crimes,” Magno said.

 Tagum said they were also looking at the possibility that Scully did not work alone. “There are numerous clients of Scully that just as guilty as he is, for they are the one who directed Scully for their fantasies, they will be tracked by the authorities,” Nuqui said. The Dutch police source said the crime that Scully committed has no boundary and he was equally liable to each country his horrific act ends. Magno said that Scully will be detained at the NBI Northern Mindanao office here and will also be arraigned here for his numerous cases, which also involved violence against women and children, rape, illegal detention (if proven that liberty has been taken away from his victims,) and the anti-cybercrime law, among others. When asked if Scully could be extradited to Australia, Magno said there was a standing extradition treaty entered between the Philippines and the Australian governments. “We need to look at the treaty (MLAT) but we want Scully to serve his time here,” Magno said.

21;OVAC;Telecom operators call for amendment of anti-child pornography law;INQUIRER.net;Cathrine Gonzales;Wed, 02 Sep 2020 16:04:35 PST;article;"MANILA, Philippines — The Philippine Chamber of Telecom Operators (PCTO) has called for the amendment of Republic Act No. 9775 or the Anti-Child Pornography Act of 2009, citing “conflicting” provisions. In an August 25-position paper submitted to Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra, PCTO noted that Section 9 of the law requires internet service providers (ISPs) to notify the Philippine National Police (PNP) or the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) within seven days of discovery that any form of child pornography is being committed using its service or facility.  It also requires that “all ISPs shall install available technology, program or software to ensure that access to or transmittal of any form of child pornography will be blocked or filtered,” the telco group pointed out. However, the same provision also states that “nothing in this section may be construed to require an ISP to engage in the monitoring of any user, subscriber or customer, or the content of any communication of any such person.”  This, according to PCTO, “in effect nullifies and prevents ISPs from precisely performing the duties imposed by Section 9.” The group urged the Department of Justice to support its position on the need to rectify the confusion and take into account “the paramount objective of protecting the welfare of children who are victims of child pornography and online sexual abuse.”  PCTO added that the Republic Act No. 10173 or the Data Privacy Act of 2012 imposes strict privacy responsibilities on entities that collect or process personal information of customers, which it said likewise contradicts the duties imposed on ISPs under RA 9775. PCTO is the umbrella organization of duly enfranchised telecommunication entities and ISPs, including telco giants PLDT Inc. and Globe Telecom. The position paper sent to Guevarra was signed by PCTO chairman Enrico Delos Reyes and president Atty. Froilan Castelo. Meanwhile, the telco group also expressed its commitment to help the government curb online child pornography and sexual abuse in the country. “PCTO condemns child pornography as a reprehensible crime that should be rightfully curtailed by the state. Blocking of unlawful content is a state duty which ISPs support,” the group said.  It added that its member-companies have been closely coordinating with the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) and law enforcement agencies, such as the PNP and the NBI in blocking child pornographic sites. According to PCTO, the NTC has so far endorsed to the telcos and ISPs more than 6,000 websites and links for blocking. NTC is an active member of the Inter-Agency Council Against Child Pornography. PCTO said Globe Telecom has already blocked a total of 2,521 sites identified by the NTC and law enforcement agencies and that the telco giant has also invested in a software filtering system worth $2.7 million to support its “PlayItRight” campaign targeting illegal or pirated content and online child pornography. Likewise, PCTO said PLDT and it’s subsidiary Smart Communications, through its Cyber Security Operations Group, have been actively identifying and blocking child pornography websites when informed by the PNP and NBI. PCTO further said that PLDT and Smart have also provided connectivity and technical assistance to enable services for the quick reporting of cases of online sex exploitation of children through text hotline 7444-64 set up by the PNP Women and Children Protection Center and the International Justice Mission.

24;OVAC;Public anger grows in S. Korea over Telegram underage sexual abuse ring;The Korea Herald/Asia News Network;The Korea Herald/Asia News Network;Sun, 22 Mar 2020 15:01:35 PST;article;Suspect Cho hides his face as he leaves the Seoul Central District Court on Thursday. Yonhap via The Korea Herald/Asia News Network SEOUL — A petition filed with the presidential office calling for the disclosure of 260,000 users of Telegram chat rooms used to share videos of sexual exploitation of minors has gained over 1 million signatures, according to the presidential website Sunday. The petition urges authorities to make public the full identities of the clients of sexual content created and distributed by a ring allegedly run by an arrested man surnamed Cho.  “There is no doubt this crime against minors is appalling and repulsive, and should never recur. But this crime will recur in South Korea, if 260,000 customers face no penalties. There is no use in punishing the operators and suppliers only, not that they will be properly punished,” the petition reads. “Users who were in the Telegram chatroom are all sex offenders. … I must know. Please reveal the full identity of all the users so that if the state will not protect children from child sex offenders we can do so ourselves.”  The petition was filed Friday, the day of Cho’s arrest, and 1.05 million people were in support of it as of Sunday morning. Cho, a man in his 20s known by his Telegram nickname “Doctor,” was arrested Friday for allegedly victimizing at least 74 people, including 16 minors, police said. He is accused of sexual exploitation and assault on top of sharing content on Telegram since December 2018.  Whether Cho’s identity will be revealed is to be decided in the coming week by a committee of three officials within the police agency and four outside the agency.  According to police, Cho tricked victims into sending him nude photos that included their face, saying it was part of a high-paying part-time job. Cho then used the nude pictures to blackmail victims, whom he referred to as “slaves,” to obtain videos of a sexual nature, and distributed them across Telegram chat rooms. Cho is believed to have run three types of paid chat rooms, charging between 200,000 won and 250,000 won ($160-$200) in cryptocurrency for level 1 chatroom, 700,000 won for level 2 and 1.5 million won for level 3. Police confiscated some 130 million won in cash at Cho’s home and are tracking proceeds of crime.  Thirteen of Cho’s alleged accomplices have been apprehended, of which four have been arrested and referred to the prosecution while nine are under police investigation, according to police.;Apps and Software;['Chat Apps', 'sexual exploitation', 'South Korea', 'technology', 'Telegram'];https://technology.inquirer.net/97586/public-anger-grows-in-s-korea-over-telegram-underage-sexual-abuse-ring;3
25;OVAC;EU, US in ‘global alliance’ to hit web child sex;Agence France-Presse;Agence France-Presse;Thu, 06 Dec 2012 08:23:33 PST;article;European Commissioner for Home Affairs Cecilia Malmstroem, right, and U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, address the media on the launching conference of the Global Alliance against Child Abuse Online, at the European Commission headquarters in Brussels, Wednesday, Dec. 5, 2012. At the launching conference, 47 countries worldwide joined forces to fight child sexual abuse online. AP/Yves Logghe BRUSSELS—The 27-nation European Union, the United States and a score of other countries on Wednesday launched a “global alliance” to stamp out trade in online images and videos of child sexual abuse. “Child sexual abuse online is a hideous crime and it is also a hidden crime, often perpetrated in the darkest corners of the web,” the EU’s home affairs commissioner Cecilia Malmstroem said at a joint news conference with US Attorney General Eric Holder.  “It is very hard and painful to talk about it. It is such a horrible thing that sometimes we just want to close our eyes in front of it,” she said. The launch follows an agreement a year ago between Holder and Malmstroem to try to place the fight against the “disgusting crimes” of online child abuse high on the global agenda.  She said images of helpless children being tortured and raped were increasingly circulating on the web, with an estimated one million such images available online and 50,000 new pictures uploaded every year. “This is why we are here today: to say loud and clear that we are serious about combating child sexual abuse online,” she said.  “When these images are circulated online, they can live on forever. Our responsibility is to protect children wherever they live and to bring criminals to justice wherever they operate. The only way to achieve this is to team up for more intensive and better coordinated action worldwide”, said Malmstroem.  Holder said the initiative “will strengthen our mutual resources to bring more perpetrators to justice, identify more victims of child sexual abuse, and ensure that they receive our help and support,” Along with the 27 EU members and the US, the members of the Alliance include Albania, Australia, Cambodia, Croatia, Georgia, Ghana, Japan, Moldova, Montenegro, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, the Philippines, Serbia, Republic of Korea, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine and Vietnam. One of the aims of the alliance is to establish dedicated law enforcement units for these crimes in all countries and make it easier to initiate joint cross-border police investigations. Countries also committed to making sure that the Interpol international database of child abuse material grows by 10 percent annually. ;Americas;['Children', 'European Union', 'Internet', 'sex', 'US'];https://globalnation.inquirer.net/58877/eu-us-in-global-alliance-to-hit-web-child-sex;3

CDN FILE PHOTO LONDON—British police are working with Australian and US counterparts in breaking up a Philippine pedophile ring that has been streaming live scenes of child abuse over the Internet, the National Crime Agency (NCA) revealed on Thursday. The NCA, which has been investigating the ring since it discovered obscene videos on a British pedophile’s computer two years ago, called abuse in developing countries “a significant and emerging threat.”  “This investigation has identified some extremely dangerous child sexual offenders who believed paying for children to be abused to order was something they could get away with,” said the agency’s Andy Baker. “Being thousands of miles away makes no difference to their guilt,” he said. “Protecting the victims of abuse is our priority and that means attacking every link in the chain, from dismantling the organized groups who are motivated by profit through to targeting their customers.”  The inquiry—called Operation Endeavor—has covered 12 countries and led to the arrest of 17 Britons, five of whom have been convicted. Fifteen children aged between 6 and 15 have been rescued in a raid in Angeles City in the Philippines and several parents were arrested. Three other investigations into live streaming of child abuse have netted 733 suspects globally.  The investigation was sparked when Northamptonshire Police seized the computer of registered sex offender Timothy Ford, who was later jailed for 8 1/2 years after being found guilty of paying to view live sex abuse.  The NCA added: “The use of webcams to stream live abuse, particularly from the developing world, is a significant and emerging threat according to the NCA’s CEOP (Child Exploitation and Online Protection) command. Child exploitation “Extreme poverty, the increasing availability of high-speed Internet and the existence of a vast and comparatively wealthy overseas customer base has led to organized crime groups exploiting children for financial gain,” the agency warned. In a special report, the BBC said that the Philippine government estimated that between 60,000 and 100,000 Filipino children had experienced sexual exploitation, many of them in cybersex. It said that while some children were forced by their own family, others were made to work in cybersex dens by pimps.  Fr. Shay Cullen, who runs the Preda Foundation, a charity that rescues victims of sexual exploitation in Olongapo City, told the BBC that more and more parents were pushing their children to get involved to make big money. “There’s a huge growing demand and there’s a growing supply,” Cullen said. The BBC team, accompanied by armed police escort, traveled to Barangay (village) Ibabao, an impoverished slum area in Mandaue that it said was the “epicenter” of the trade. A police officer, Denis Comunay, led the group to a “cybersex den”—a small house that was almost empty except for a dirty mattress on the floor and electric sockets hanging from the ceiling. “Fathers and mothers would bring their children here to show, and would get paid by the owner of the house,” Comunay said. He explained the property owner forced her own children to “perform” for foreigners using a webcam. He said other people in the neighborhood who heard there was money to be made brought their children there, too. The BBC said that a recent survey indicated that 80 houses in the area were involved in the trade, in spite of raids conducted by police. Sex exploitation has become a “cottage industry” in the area, according to the BBC. Poverty blamed In September last year, a Filipino couple in their 30s were arrested in Ibabao for forcing their three young children to engage in sex acts and charging clients up to $100 each to watch using webcams. Noemi Truye-Abarientos of the Children’s Legal Bureau, which provides legal aid to abuse victims, blamed poverty and a breakdown in public morality for the rise in the trade. She said that local businessmen rented out laptops and USB Internet connections so it was easy for families to get in the business.

 “Parents use Internet chat rooms to find ‘clients’ and receive payment through international money transfers. They justify what they do by claiming that foreign pedophiles do not actually touch the children,” the BBC said. The network said that an arrested British man disclosed he paid 13 pounds (P959) to watch a “show.” ‘Even parents involved’ Senior Supt. Gilbert Sosa, head of the Philippine National Police anticybercrime unit, said efforts had been intensified to end child sexual abuse. “This has become a major problem in the Philippines, where in some cases even the parents are involved,” he said. Sosa declined to give details that could compromise ongoing operations. The Australian Federal Police said it had executed six search warrants under the international operation that had led to the arrest of three Australians. “Two of the men were arrested in Western Australia and one Sydney man was arrested by the Royal Thai Police in Bangkok,” it said. “Hundreds of thousands of images and videos depicting online child sexual exploitation, including children as young as 5 years old, were found during the searches.” The Australian offenders allegedly financed and ordered child abuse “shows” from the Philippines.—Reports from AFP and BBC

27;OVAC;DSWD seeks NBI, police help in 2 cases of online sexual abuse vs children;INQUIRER.net;Consuelo Marquez;Tue, 23 Jun 2020 17:33:48 PST;article;MANILA, Philippines — The Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) has sought the assistance of the National Bureau of Investigation and the Philippine National Police for action on two recent cases of Online Sexual Exploitation of Children (OSEC). A report from DSWD Field Office VIII showed that the two OSEC cases involved a 13-year-old girl from Silago in Southern Leyte and a 17-year-old from Tacloban.  “(The) cases were referred to the National Bureau of Investigation and the Philippine National Police Anti-Cybercrime Unit for surveillance,” read the statement. In the same statement, DSWD Regional Director Marie Angela Gopalan said families “should give our children utmost protection as kids are vulnerable to exploitation.”  Gopalan also said that the internet has become “an integral part of modern life and that OSEC has become a lucrative business.” In a study by the International Justice Mission (IJM), cases of internet-based sexual exploitation of children in the Philippines continued to go up, with eight out of every 10 perpetrators related by blood or affinity to the victims, according to a new study.  An estimated number of internet protocol (IP) addresses used for OSEC soared from 23,333 in 2014 to 81,723 in 2017, the IJM study further showed. IJM also claimed that cases of OSEC in the Philippines have tripled in as many years, with eight out of every 10 perpetrators related by blood or affinity to child victims. This fact has already reached the Senate, with Senator Risa Hontiveros alerting the NBI about the “dramatic” spike of cases of OSEC in the wake of government-imposed lockdowns. ;Nation;['Children', 'DSWD', 'International Justice Mission (IJM)', 'Nation', 'online abuse', 'Osec'];https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1296200/dswd-seeks-help-from-nbi-police-in-2-cases-of-online-sexual-abuse-vs-children;3
28;OVAC;Child rights and WCST;Philippine Daily Inquirer;Michael L. Tan;Tue, 28 Jan 2014 21:47:19 PST;article;"I wrote the other Wednesday about the exposé of WCST in the Philippines by Terre des Hommes Netherlands (TdH), leading to international calls for governments to crack down. WCST means “webcam child sex tourism,” where minors are made to perform live shows on the Internet for pedophile customers. I thought I had heard the worst until Peter Dupont, a Belgian journalist, sent me two of his articles that shocked me. The pictures were properly pixelized (blurred) but were still gruesome.  There were accounts, too, of children recruiting classmates, and of incest.  How did we get to be so depraved?

WCST is only the latest in a longer history of child sexual exploitation.  In the 1970s and 1980s Ermita’s red-light district in Manila included a street, Sta. Monica, notorious for pedophiles and child sex workers. Pagsanjan in Laguna was also the subject of many news articles and TV documentaries in the 1980s, with the town’s residents able to identify houses put up by pedophiles to support boys and their families.  Pedophile paradise But it wasn’t just Pagsanjan. The entire country was paradise for pedophiles and it was not uncommon to see them in resorts and hotels, sometimes one person with several child sex workers.  Running parallel to pedophile tourism was child pornography, with a brisk trade in photos and videos that exploded when the Internet came around. Countries like the Philippines supplied the child models for the photos and videos.  Because of pressure from women’s organizations and child rights’ groups, governments began to crack down on the sex tourism and Internet child pornography. All kinds of laws and ordinances were passed, and even the Interpol was drawn in. The pedophiles went underground… and into the Internet, which offered new opportunities for them. As broadband services began to offer higher speeds, it now became possible to have live or streaming videos.  The TdH report on WCST had one story about a Filipino woman first offering herself for webcam sex, and then meeting someone who said he wasn’t interested in her but in her children. She then began putting her daughter, and her daughter’s friends, on the webcam. Pedophiles don’t need to spend to travel to countries like the Philippines to find child sex workers.  They can do this now on the Internet, in fairly safe conditions, because the webcam services are virtual, with no fixed addresses. This does not mean pedophiles have completely stopped traveling. The webcam services have also become ways to contact child sex workers (as well as to prey on children in social media sites). Once in the Philippines, they run fewer risks because they already have the contacts.  There is no lack of laws against child pornography, cybersex, and child prostitution in the Philippines.  The problem is enforcement, with police waiting for reports by victims before they raid suspected dens. But we also need to begin asking: Why has the Philippines figured, time and time again, as a favored destination for pedophiles?  Why are our parents so “cheap,” so willing to sacrifice their children? The usual answer given is “poverty,” but there are many other countries poorer than we are, and which do not have this sex tourism problem. Children as chattel I propose we go back to fundamentals: How do we look at children? For all the talk about Filipinos’ love of children, many consider children almost as chattel, private property, who must be totally obedient and subservient. Parents reproduce with the view that someday, these children will have to take care of them.  All too often, that “someday” starts as early as childhood. It’s not surprising we have so many children sent out to the streets by their own parents to beg or to sell flowers and flannel (often sounding more like beggars as they urge you to buy the flowers so they can get food). Our professed love of children is questionable. The later the night, the younger the children seen in the streets. I cannot understand why the Department of Social Welfare and Development can’t crack down, once and for all, on the parents of these child vendors.  We take this for granted, thinking it’s part of poverty, but even visitors from poor countries have told me they don’t have as many street children as we do, and certainly not to weave in and out of traffic on busy streets. Besides the child vendors, we have thousands of other child workers, in all kinds of hazardous work situations, all the way up to mining. Remember the era of the “japayuki,” when many young Filipino women were going off to Japan to work as entertainers? When that was happening, I actually heard parents, and, at one time, a grandmother, talking about how they push their daughters to study hard, to finish high school, so they could go to Japan to work. Together with this idea of children as chattel, many parents still think of minors almost as innocently mindless—“walang muwang” in Filipino.  Corporal punishment and physical trauma are seen as ways to shape a child’s character.  The idea of psychological trauma is even more distant.

 Betrayal We have to confront all these perceptions, and try to reshape them.  There have been studies of victims of WCST, the children found to be suffering from all kinds of problems.  There’s traumatic sexualization, where a child’s sexual development is hastened through rape, sexual abuse, or this WCST. Trauma-induced sexuality is of course filled with anxieties, often masked because the children will, on the surface, appear to be callous and tough. The children also feel betrayed by the people they trusted so much. The TdH report notes: “Children exploited in family-based WCST operations show deeper internalization of the idea that performing sexual acts on camera for money is acceptable, in some cases necessary. As their parents have repeatedly told child victims that the behavior is harmless and not at all shameful because the children are not physically touched, these ideas are more deeply instilled in these children’s minds when compared to children exploited by non-family relations.” There’s a sense of powerlessness, too, especially among those who are victimized by trafficking and taken away from their families to work in virtual brothels. Finally, there is the issue of social stigmatization. It is shocking to read about how these Internet dens are found in neighborhoods, with the community—like an entire barangay in Cebu—knowing about the operations. We need to intensify education about children’s rights, and change local concepts about children so older people understand that children start thinking early in life. Even more difficult is explaining that children do have sexuality, and that usually, they will develop this sexuality across time, in a healthy way. If abused, though, the traumatic sexuality that emerges will be extremely problematic, affecting the children for the rest of their lives. These children will someday become parents as well, and I shudder to think how they will raise the next generation. (E-mail: mtan@inquirer.com.ph)";Columnists;['Child Rights', 'Michael L.

29;OVAC;Study highlights global threat of online sexual exploitation of children ;No news platform;No Author;Sun, 29 Dec 2019 09:00:20 PST;No news type;"Participants of the WeProtect Global Alliance Summit. | Contributed Photo Children aged 10 years or younger make up over a third of the images assessed to be in the most serious category of online sexual exploitation and abuse, according to the Global Threat Assessment 2019 report released by the WePROTECT Global Alliance during summit held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia from December 11-12, 2019. International Justice Mission (IJM) Cebu Field Office Director John Tanagho joined representatives from 39 organizations operating to both prevent and respond to online child sexual exploitation and abuse in over 30 countries worldwide. During the summit, political leaders, senior representatives from international organizations and subject-matter experts spoke out about the threat of online child sexual exploitation and abuse and the commensurate response required. “As internet coverage continues to grow rapidly around the world, the scale and impact of the threat to children of online sexual exploitation and abuse is growing dramatically. 200,000 children go online for the first time every day, often with little or no awareness of or protection from the risks. We must seize the opportunity for more effective coordinated action to keep children safe online before it is too late,” says End Violence Executive Director and WePROTECT Global Alliance member, Dr. Howard Taylor.  “Every single photo, every single video of a child being abused is not a data point, not a number – it’s a child. It is a child who will be haunted not only of the memories of their abuse, but by the fear of its ceaseless digital lifespan.” Children who experience sexual abuse are more likely to be socially isolated, suffer from mental health problems, and attempt and commit suicide. They are also more likely to develop alcohol or drug dependencies. These outcomes impact every aspect of a child’s life, including a higher likelihood to perpetuate a cycle of violence onto the next generation. Participants of the End Violence Guarantee Funds Convening. | Contributed Photo The Global Threat Assessment aims to raise further international awareness, provide greater understanding of the threat and how it is evolving, provide case studies of progress, and critically, highlight 11 steps needed to tackle the threat. This year’s assessment report also revealed that there are 46 million unique images or videos relating to child sexual exploitation and abuse in EUROPOL’s database and 750,000 individuals looking to connect with children for sexual purposes online at any one time. The summit followed the largest gathering of the End Violence network of grantees (held last December 9-10 in Addis Ababa) who discussed the innovative solutions being implemented to prevent and respond to online child sexual exploitation and abuse. “This is a universal and global issue requiring a universal response. Solutions exist and good progress is being made, but stronger collaboration is urgently needed among policy makers, technology companies and civil society organizations,” Taylor says. Thanks to the End Violence Fund, which has invested over US$32 million in national, regional and global projects, the participants were able to exchange learnings, consider the strengths and areas for improvement in strategies, and explore further opportunities for collaboration. “Through the End Violence Fund, we are able to sustain our ability to operate at a high level of trust with our partners in the criminal justice system, specifically targeting to end the online sexual exploitation of children (OSEC) in Cebu, Philippines,” says Tanagho, who presented the progress being made in the Philippines during the End Violence Fund Grantee Convening last December 9-10 and the WePROTECT Global Alliance Summit. As of November 2019, the fund has allowed IJM to support Philippine law enforcers in the rescue of 150 victims in 44 operations. Fifty-two (52) perpetrators have been arrested and 19 of them have already been convicted and brought to account. “When traffickers and online sex offenders operate with impunity, vulnerable children continually live in fear of the next live streamed sexual abuse. But when the justice system responds to end that impunity by arresting and prosecuting perpetrators and rescuing children, it is now the perpetrators who live in fear that at any moment the police will find them and hold them accountable under the law,” adds Tanagho. / dcb

30;OVAC;A plague on children;Philippine Daily Inquirer;Philippine Daily Inquirer;Sun, 11 Dec 2016 00:14:21 PST;article;"That, according to Unicef country representative Lotta Sylwander, the Philippines now appears to be “some kind of center” for the sexual abuse of children is a damning indication of the plague on Filipino kids. Then again it’s hardly new; it has been reported before—that pedophiles from all over the world consider the Philippines happy hunting grounds for children, particularly the impoverished, who are offered as prey by their own families in exchange for tidy sums. In fact cybersex shops have been found to operate in the middle of villages and towns, with parents themselves serving as pimps.  The survey by Unicef and the Philippine Council for the Welfare of Children had harrowing findings: Eight of 10 Filipino youth are subjected to one form of abuse or another. Among children and youth aged 13-24, one in five had been sexually abused, with over 60 percent of the cases occurring in their own homes.  This first ever study, known as the National Baseline Study on Violence against Children (NBS-VAC), tells us how bad things have gotten. A glance at the past reinforces the horror. In 2015, Taguig City police managed to rescue eight girls aged 13-18 from a house where they had been forced to engage in sexual acts for online viewers in countries such as Japan and the United States; among the adults arrested was the mother of three of the children. The mastermind, a 33-year-old man, had been charging viewers $50 to $100. Earlier that year, a 51-year-old Australian was arrested for sexually abusing eight girls, even killing one of them. In 2014, Navotas City authorities, with the aid of an agent from the US Department of Homeland Security, rescued four young girls and arrested two suspected cybersex traffickers. In 2014 the town of Cordova in Metro Cebu was tagged “ground zero of online child pornography.” As one official of the Department of Social Welfare and Development in Central Visayas said, “village officials know that it is happening but they have not done anything.”  Aside from the tragedy of family members trafficking their kin, online child pornography is horrific because it takes a boon that empowers—the democratic effect of technology and the internet—and turns it into a bane that destroys. “The internet and mobile phones have revolutionized young people’s access to information, but the poll findings show just how real the risk of online abuse is for girls and boys,” said Cornelius Williams, Unicef associate director for child protection. Unicef reported that the number of criminal cases filed in the Philippines has risen from 57 in 2013 to 167 in 2015. It’s a hugely dangerous world out there, with international child rights agency Terre des Hommes stating there are more than 75,000 child predators prowling the internet. Beyond sexual abuse, there are the occurrences of physical violence such as corporal punishment carried out in schools by teachers. Principal investigator Dr. Laurie Ramiro noted that there is a “high acceptability” of corporal punishment in Philippine society, as well as a “culture of silence” that is passed down from one abused generation to the next.  It’s time to come to terms with this unacceptable situation that continues to threaten some of what could become the Philippines’ best and brightest. “The study has shown that we really need to be more serious in addressing violence against children which is happening all over the country, from the places that are supposedly safe—the homes—to the schools to the streets and the rest of the community,” said Social Welfare Secretary Judy Taguiwalo.  A regular conduct of the NBS-VAC in the coming years will provide responsible officials with an opportunity to monitor the situation and devise effective means to end these crimes against young Filipinos. This festering problem needs a wholistic solution, from stamping out poverty to generating employment to, again, intensive information campaigns for both adults and kids on the evils of child abuse.";Editorial;['abuse', 'Philippine Council for the Welfare of Children', 'Unicef', 'violence against children'];https://opinion.inquirer.net/99926/a-plague-on-children;4
31;OVAC;‘A very powerful voice’: Liza Soberano uses platform vs internet-based child abuses;INQUIRER.net;Christia Marie Ramos;Fri, 22 May 2020 14:46:52 PST;article;"Screengrab from “NOT FOR SALE” WEBINAR: Protecting our children from online sexual exploitation. IN PHOTO: Atty. Rey Bicol of the International Justice Mission (top left); actress Liza Soberano (top right); Senator Risa Hontiveros (bottom left); and Nitz Dalde from the Child Rights Network (bottom right) MANILA, Philippines — A tweet by Senator Risa Hontiveros on how social media is being used to sexually exploit children fueled actress Liza Soberano to use her platform against social injustice. In a webinar tackling ways to end online sexual exploitation of children (OSEC) on Friday, Soberano opened up about feeling a sense of regret for not initially being aware that such abuses are perpetrated on social media and how she could have used her platform to trigger social awareness.  The webinar was organized by Hontiveros and was attended by Atty. Rey Bicol of the International Justice Mission (IJM) and Nitz Dalde from the Child Rights Network. “I was very vocal about being upset about the matter. Isa po akong ate, panganay po ako sa seven na kapatid ko. Hindi ko ma-comprehend na nagagawa po ng mga tao yun. I’m aware that it’s happening on the dark web pero hind po ako aware na nangyayari din po siya sa mga social media platforms. It was my first (time) seeing people actually selling these photos, videos, graphic images of our children and I’m upset on my part na hindi ko alam na nangyayari siya,” Soberano said.  I am ENRAGED. I saw so many videos  online that absolutely broke my heart. An innocent man got shot, a teacher went to jail, and multiple street vendors. Is anyone doing anything about this??? https://t.co/qW9knmcSIE — Liza Soberano (@lizasoberano) May 14, 2020   “I could’ve done something earlier to prevent those from happening by using my platform. Dapat naisip na natin na posible siyang mangyari through those outlets and it could be prevented and we could’ve spread more awareness to our people,” she added. The 22-year-old actress, who has nearly four million Twitter followers, said that she reported the pages featured in Hontiveros’ tweet but added that while there was “some sense of relief” that she was able to help in her own way, she wondered if it had been enough. “Hindi ko kasi alam kung hanggang saan umaabot yung tulong na binibigay ko. Hindi ako aware if effective ba ang mass reporting. Kung nire-retweet ko ba or nire-retweet din ng ibang fans ko, nakikita ba yun ng NBI (National Bureau of Investigation) or ng authorities. Yun po yung mga tanong sa utak ko kung pano ba nai-execute… whatever it is that needs to be given to these monsters or these criminals online,” she said. But Bicol said Soberano was able to provide a “very powerful voice in this movement against online sexual exploitation of children.”  “So kumbaga napukaw ang pansin ng publiko… This actually caught the attention of the public and as this catches the attention of the public, of course the attention of our government will be called,” he said. He, meanwhile, noted that the government is continuing its efforts to rescue victims through the Philippine National Polices’s Women and Children Protection Center and the NBI’s Anti-Trafficking Division. Nevertheless, Bicol underscored the importance of the community’s role in the battle against such abuses. “Malaki po ang role ng community in this fight. Meron po kaming mga kaso na talaga na na aman ng mga pulis because people in the community, like one of church partners, reported about the issue and the police did something about it,” he said. According to Bicol, OSEC is the “worst form of child abuse” he has encountered in the many years that he has been working with IJM. “When you say online sexual exploitation of children o OSEC, ito yung live streaming of sexual abuse of children for a customer who is normally in a foreign country, in exchange for money,” he explained. Bicol said that these crimes are usually facilitated by Filipinos in the Philippines and the perpetrators behind such abuses are “normally” the parents of relatives of the victims. A study led by IJM, a US-based non-governmental organization that fights human trafficking and child abuse, showed that eight in 10 perpetrators are related to the victims. The study also stated that the Philippines is a “global hotspot” for OSEC. “In this age of information technology talagang we’re seeing this high prevalence of internet crimes against children, moreso of internet-based sexual abuse of children,” Bicol said.

 “I would say in my years of my work with international justice mission ito yung worst form of child abuse that I’ve encountered  in the field because this involves very young victims. Most of our cases involve children below 12 years old and as I said, ang mga nangaabuso ay mga kamag-anak and sadly yung mga magulang ng mga batang ito,” he added. Hontiveros, chair of the Senate committee on women, children, family relations and gender equality, said it was important for netizens to use social media to flag online pages that are sexually exploiting children. “Since netizens use different social media platforms, at alam natin na ironically ito rin ang nagiging daluyan nitong mga krimen laban sa bata, then we netizens using these platforms report the use of whether Facebook or Twitter even Telegram and Whatsapp for these contacts between buyers and sellers of OSEC,” the senator said.  These are some of the Facebook groups and pages that we tracked down. Sa lockdown, parang mas kumalat ang mga online sex… Posted by Senator Risa Hontiveros on Thursday, May 21, 2020 “Importante as netizens na we can use these platforms para singilin yung accountability nung mga nagiging daluyan ng pabayad, pagbili nitong OSEC materials,” she added. Hontiveros also called the attention of banks and money sending institutions which she said can be used by perpetrators for transactions. “We can and should use these various social media platform para to call the attention of our fellow citizens and call the attention nung ating mga law enforcement agencies kapag itong mga apps, itong mga platforms ay mini-misuse use to further the victimization and the violation of our children,” the senator said. Soberano said she witnessed how her tweets influenced other people to report social media pages committing these abuses.

 “I was told the other day when I was invited to do this webinar  that me voicing out my opinion about the matter has helped in many ways because a lot of people who saw my tweets reacted to it and started reported other pages that are responsible for OSEC,” she said. “As a celebrity, due to my large following, I realize that I should use my voice for social injustice and I realize that a role of an advocate is to offer independent support to those who feel that they are not being heard or to ensure that action is taken seriously upon these criminals,” the actress added.";Celebrities and Showbiz;['International Justice Mission', 'internet-based child abuse', 'Liza Soberano', 'nation', 'news', 'online sexual exploitation of children', 'OSEC', 'Rey Bicol', 'Senator Risa Hontiveros'];https://entertainment.inquirer.net/376359/fwd-a-very-powerful-voice-liza-soberano-on-using-platform-vs-internet-based-child-abuses;4
32;OVAC;Canada enacts internet ban for sex offenders;Agence France-Presse;Agence France-Presse;Fri, 22 Jul 2016 09:33:22 PST;article;MONTREAL, Canada—Canada’s Supreme Court on Thursday acted to protect children in the fast-growing world of cyberspace, enabling judges to prohibit those convicted of sexual offenses against minors from using the internet. “The record demonstrates that the internet is increasingly being used to sexually offend against young people and that sex offenders who target children are more likely to re-offend,” Justice Andromache Karakatsanis wrote for the majority in a hundred-page ruling.  The case concerned incest and child pornography. The accused man, sentenced to nine years in prison in 2013 by a court in British Columbia, had abused his daughter between 2008 and 2011. In addition to upholding his prison sentence, the court prohibited him from accessing the internet, retroactively applying a provision to the criminal code added after the offenses took place.  The country’s previous Conservative government introduced a provision in its Safe Streets and Communities Act of 2012 prohibiting internet use for sex offenders. In its seven-to-two ruling, the court banned internet access to anyone convicted of sexual offenses against minors before 2012 — rejecting the constitutional principle guiding courts to impose lesser punishments if the criminal code is changed between the time offenses are committed and sentencing is carried out.  “The rate of technological change over the past decade has fundamentally altered the social context in which sexual crimes can occur,” the ruling said, adding that “monitoring an offender’s use of the internet can limit an offender’s opportunities to offend and prevent this harmful behavior.”  RELATED STORIES Father gets life for selling daughters to child pornographer Star ng Glee, inaresto dahil sa child pornography;Internet;['Canada', 'Child Pornography', 'Cybercrime', 'cybersex', 'Internet', 'pedophile', 'sex abuse', 'sex offenders', 'sexual offenses'];http://technology.inquirer.net/49901/canada-enacts-internet-ban-for-sex-offenders;4
45;OVAC;Lolita complex;Philippine Daily Inquirer;Michael L. Tan;Wed, 10 Sep 2014 01:06:44 PST;article;"There have been 45 child rape cases in recent months, involving 43 girls and two boys as victims, according to a GMA-7 newscast Monday night. I did an Internet search on local reports and found grim statistics from the Philippine National Police: 4,234 reported child rape incidents in 2013, up from 3,355 in 2012.  As I searched the Internet, “child rape” yielded far fewer results than “bata ginahasa,” suggesting that it is Filipino tabloids, and newscasts, that tend to report these cases, keeping the problem out of sight for upper-class Filipinos. The cases are horrifying, involving even infants. The perpetrators are often stepfathers or family members, but there are also cases involving strangers. A few weeks back there was one case where street CCTV cameras caught a man abducting an infant sleeping with her parents on the street. The infant was found later, dead and a victim of sexual abuse.  Children as property I had intended to publicly thank De La Salle University for its Scholarum award, which was given for a column I wrote last January, “Child rights and WCST.” There had been much publicity about WCST, or webcam child sex tourism, following a disturbing exposé by Terre des Hommes Netherlands of a global child porn network, with the Philippines figuring prominently, on parents literally selling their children to perform, live, on the Internet for pedophile viewers.  My column went beyond the exposé to ask why the Philippines has been a haven for pedophiles, dating back to the 1970s with child prostitution in Ermita, the entire town of Pagsanjan where parents allowed young sons to have sugar daddies in exchange for houses and other perks, and now, this Web-based sex tourism.  It’s often argued that poverty drives child prostitution and WCST. I’d argue there’s much more involved; it’s the way our culture looks at young children. We see them as chattel, without any rights. They are expected to obey our every command and, in the case of child labor, to help support the family financially, even if it means selling their bodies. The spate of child rape cases made me decide to do a whole column as a sequel to that January column. It’s time we thought hard about whether we have a Lolita complex creeping into our national culture, making it easier for adult males to victimize young girls. Let me explain this Lolita complex. In 1955, the Russian-American novelist Vladimir Nabokov wrote a novel titled “Lolita.” The novel opens with a description of an adult’s attraction to a 9-year-old girl, “4 feet 10 in socks.” The novel stirred controversy, yet it was made into movies (the first one was Stanley Kubrick’s “Lolita,” made in 1962) and plays, perhaps in part because it had dared to probe into an underside of many people’s psyche.  In 1965, American Russell Trainer wrote a book, “The Lolita Complex,” expanding on Nabokov’s novel. It was translated into Japanese and led to the Japanese coining the word “lolicon” (or “roricon”) to describe sexual attraction to young girls. The Japanese manga comic book industry picked up on this, creating an entire genre that is still popular today, where young girls are depicted in cartoons, and later, in hentai (pornographic animé) as sexual objects. “Lolita” has now entered the vocabularies of several languages to refer to a young girl who looks seductive or precocious. In Japan, “lolicon” has become almost a national obsession, even leading to mainstream “Lolita fashion” where adult women will dress up like schoolgirls. There is even a version now called “shotacon,” with young boys as the object in manga and hentai, although with a twist here because the following is mainly of women, and not of gay men. Last June, Japan outlawed the possession of child porn but exempted manga and animé, lawmakers bowing to lobbying from comic book manufacturers that there had been no proof that the “lolicon” cartoons were harmful. It is not just in Japan where the Lolita complex becomes legitimized. Last year, the French Senate banned beauty contests for minors, defined as those below the age of 16. Such contests originated in the United States and has caught on as well in the United Kingdom. In these contests, very young girls dress up like adults, complete with makeup and “sexy” outfits, including bikinis, sashaying down the ramp and performing to vie for titles and prizes, including scholarships. I see some signs of a “lolicon” in the Philippines. There are all kinds of noontime talent contests where young girls (and occasionally boys) are made to sing and dance, with a premium placed on how “sexy” they can be. It all looks like innocent fun, but remember the furor a few years ago where a young boy broke down crying as he was made to perform macho dancing. I see a creeping “lolicon,” too, in the way young girls are made to dress up in outfits with bare midriffs, platform shoes, or even heels. I’m no prude and would normally have no problem with clothes that are sometimes described as “kita na ang bituka (so skimpy you can see the intestines),” but I worry about, besides the sexual aspects, the practicality of these fashions. The platform shoes and heels are definitely problematic, making the young girls more prone to falls and sprains, and some of the body-hugging clothes they wear are just not made for the rough-and-tumble world of children. Children would be more comfortable, and safer, if they just wear loose jeans and a T-shirt, but I’ve actually been told by other parents that they don’t want their daughters becoming “tomboys” by wearing such apparel. Sexualizing girls We sexualize girls, making them feel they have to be like all those starlets on TV and in the movies. In a sense, each foray into the mall becomes almost like a beauty contest, with young girls imitating adults with swaying hips.

 The American Psychological Association notes that “girls sexualized early will tend to gather their self-worth as an adult based on their appearance.”  Ask around, especially in urban poor areas, and you will find young girls’ ambitions to become an artista. Ask them to name which artista they want to emulate, and you’ll get the names of the sexy ones. Certainly, the problems of child rape and sexual abuse do not just involve the Lolita complex, “lolicon” itself being embedded in broader power relationships, adults over children, males over females. I also hope the broadcast media can be more introspective when reporting child rape cases, wondering if perhaps we’re seeing a serial effect from all the sensationalism around these crimes. Let’s be conscious about how our blind spots in culture may increase the children’s vulnerability, and let’s work harder to let our children enjoy childhood.

46;OVAC;29-year-old woman arrested for online trafficking in Daanbantayan, 4 rescued;No news platform;No Author;Wed, 11 Mar 2020 23:05:00 PST;No news type;Operatives from the Women and Children Protection Center – Visayas Field Unit (WCPC-VFU) arrested a 29-year-old woman who was caught offering to sexually abuse her daughter and relatives online in exchange for money from a foreign sex offender. | Photo Courtesy of International Justice Mission (IJM) CEBU CITY, Philippines — A 29-year-old woman who was allegedly offering to sexually abuse her daughter and relatives online in exchange for money from a foreign sex offender was arrested by members of the police’s Women and Children Protection Center – Visayas Field Unit (WCPC-VFU) on March 10, 2020, at around 1 p.m. in Daan Bantayan, north Cebu. In a press statement from International Justice Mission (IJM), three minors, aged 5 to 12 years old, were rescued along with an adult victim, aged 27. The four victims were said to be related to the suspect. The suspect’s five-year-old son was also moved out of the area as he was considered at risk. The arrest of the suspect was said to be based on the referral given to the Philippine Internet Crimes Against Children Center (PICACC) on June 21, 2019.  During that time the PICACC received information from the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) regarding an American national who was suspected of sending money to the Philippines in exchange for explicit photographs of minors. WCPC-VFU then conducted investigations that led to the identification of the local facilitator. Three female minors were found to have been offered for sexual exploitation online in exchange for money during the surveillance. “Now that the suspect is restrained, this does not only mean protection and safety of her victims but also those children who would have been abused if she was not restrained at all,” said Lawyer Lucille Dejito, Head of Prosecution Development at IJM Cebu Field Office. WCPC-VFU conducted the operation in coordination with the Inter-Agency Council Against Trafficking (IACAT) 7, Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) 7, and Daanbantayan Police Office, with support from International Justice Mission (IJM). Occurring in various communities in the Philippines, OSEC is a crime that violates the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act or Republic Act (RA) No. 9208 (as amended by RA 10364), which comes with a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of P2 million to P5 million. Typical OSEC offenses also violate RA 10175 (Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012), RA 9775 (Anti?Child Pornography Act of 2009) and RA 7610  (Anti-Child Abuse Law). One may report a suspected case of OSEC by texting ENDOSEC (space) (incident details) to 7444-64 for Smart network subscribers, or directly connect with WCPC at  (032) 410-8483 for Visayas, and 0917-180-6037 or 0928-604-6425 for Mindanao. /rcg;No news category;No Tags;https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/293506/29-year-old-woman-arrested-for-online-trafficking-in-daanbantayan-4-rescued;5
47;OVAC;Girls’ rights advocate raises alarm over gender-related abuses during quarantine;No news platform;No Author;Mon, 22 Jun 2020 21:43:14 PST;No news type;Stop Sexual abuse Concept, stop violence against Women, international women’s day CEBU CITY, Philippines — A group of non-government organizations (NGOs) has called on the government to “empower, protect and immediately respond” to the needs of girls and young women amid the high number of cases of gender-related violence during the implementation of community quarantine protocols. The group, Girls Advocacy Alliance, urged authorities to monitor the women and children who are at “increased risk” of violence, exploitation, abuse, and neglect and ensure the access and availability of access to and availability hotlines for reporting abuses and online helplines for psychosocial support and legal advice.  “The Girls Advocacy Alliance also urges local governments to boost efforts in preventing and addressing gender-based violence among their constituencies through intensive online and community-based information campaigns,” the GAA said in a statement. Quoting data from the Philippine National Police (PNP), the GAA said at least 2,183 cases of violence against women and 2,077 cases of violence from the start of the quarantine controls last March until early this  June 2020.  “Child-focused groups are receiving more and more reports of harassment and sex trafficking on social media, with many online perpetrators even promising ‘lifetime membership’ and ‘exclusive access’ to child sexual abuse photos and videos,” the GAA said. ? “According to data gathered by the Philippine Commission on Women, the reported gender-based violence incidents include violations of the Anti-Rape Law, Anti-Violence Against Women and their Children Act, Articles No. 334 and 336 of the Revised Penal Code, Anti-Photo and Video Voyeurism Act, Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act, Anti-Sexual Harassment Act, and Safe Spaces Act,” it added. The GAA added said it was also alarmed by the possibility that the reported number might not reflect the extent of the abuses yet.  READ: Gov’t agencies: Report gender-based violence in your areas While poverty is a major cause of exploitation, the GAA added that the ongoing economic struggle might force girls and women to engage in prostitution to support their families.  “Parents may coerce their children to perform sexual acts in exchange for money. With children spending more time on the internet because of school closures, perpetrators may take advantage of the situation and lure them to perform sexually explicit acts in front of the camera,” the group said. “The reluctance to speak and fear to report — combined with quarantines, very limited access to protection and support services, weak law enforcement, and victim shaming — leaves the door wide open for more children and women to fall prey to being sexually abused and exploited,” it added. The group also called for the disaggregation of data related to the COVID-19 outbreak by sex, age, and disability. From the disaggregated data, the group has also urged the government to analyze and understand the “gendered differences in impact, exposure and treatment, and to design differential preventive measures.”/dbs;No news category;No Tags;https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/320692/girls-rights-advocate-raises-alarm-over-gender-related-abuses-during-quarantine;5
48;OVAC;Internet hindering fight against human trafficking — experts;Agence France-Presse;Agence France-Presse;Wed, 13 Sep 2017 09:27:50 PST;article;San José, Costa Rica — The anonymity afforded by the internet — especially in the dark web — is hindering efforts by organizations to fight human trafficking, especially the sexual exploitation of minors, experts from key groups said Tuesday. “The issue of the dark web, which for its form and configuration is extremely untraceable, is it makes it very difficult to find the criminals we are looking for,” Rosilyne Borland, a specialist on migrant assistance in Central and North America at the UN migration agency IOM, told an international conference in Costa Rica’s capital.  She and other speakers told the event, focused on tourism-related sexual abuse of children, that such crimes previously could be tracked through physical locations but were now online, where they were much harder to detect because of encryption, anonymity and locations easily masked. “Practically the whole process happens through digital means, and that makes it extremely difficult for location and identification,” said the head of Costa Rica’s PANI child welfare agency, Ana Teresa Leon.  The conference heard that up-to-date figures on human trafficking were to be presented at the UN General Assembly later this month. A video presentation said 46 million people worldwide were in situations of modern slavery, which is one aspect of the crime, along with the sexual exploitation of adults and minors.  In Costa Rica, Leon said, there were 56 victims of sexual exploitation last year.  That “very low number,” she said, was partly explained by the difficulty in identifying victims — and that many caught up in such situations didn’t see themselves as victims. Sex tourism is a sensitive issue for Costa Rica, which has taken steps to crack down on it. The head of the tourist board, Alberto Lopez, told the conference that, since 2010, “more than 450 businesses” — many of them hotels — have signed on to a code of conduct against the sexual exploitation of minors.;Internet;['Children', 'Crime', 'human trafficking', 'Internet', 'sex tourism', 'sexual exploitation', 'technology'];https://technology.inquirer.net/66889/internet-hindering-fight-human-trafficking-experts;6
49;OVAC;Palace vows to track, prosecute cybersex peddlers;INQUIRER.net;Kristine Angeli Sabillo;Sat, 18 Jan 2014 13:24:32 PST;article; MANILA, Philippines—Malacañang on Saturday vowed to step up efforts to curb child sex abuse in the Philippines following announcement by law enforcers that cyberpornography is the No. 1 crime in the country today.  “It’s important for us to protect our minors, number one. Number two, it’s always a concern for us because we don’t want to be identified as a (haven for tourists engaging in illegal activities),” Presidential spokesperson Edwin Lacierda said in a press briefing. “When I spoke to (Tourism) Secretary Mon Jimenez, we want to be remembered that Philippines is fun place to be in and fun in a positive way,” he said.  Senior Superintendent Gilbert Sosa, director of the PNP Anti-Transnational and Cyber Crime Division of the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group, said Friday that the Philippines is among the top 10 countries in the world where cyberpornography is rampant. Police investigation showed that Angeles City in Pampanga province, Cebu province, Cagayan de Oro City, and Metro Manila are the top four transmittal sites for online pornography, Sosa said.  “The data speaks for itself. It is now the No. 1 crime in our country. We have to act on this,” he said.  Lacierda said authorities are working to monitor and arrest those behind online sex trade. “Well, if there are protectors, number one, we will not countenance any syndicates that will prowl on our minors and that they will be used for instrument of – as sexual instruments. That is something that we will, really, pound the hammer on,” he said. The spokesperson also warned parents that they will be prosecuted if they are peddling their children through cyberpornography as their source of income.

50;OVAC;Philippines to charge Australian on Internet sex;Agence France-Presse;Agence France-Presse;Sat, 07 Mar 2015 16:26:10 PST;article;CHILD ABUSERS A government investigator leads away a cuffed Peter Gerard Scully (top photo) whowas arrested for producing pornographic videos that showed toddlers and children being sexuallyassaulted and tortured by his live-in partner, “Lovely.” CONTRIBUTED PHOTO MANILA, Philippines—Philippine prosecutors said Thursday they will file human trafficking, statutory rape and murder charges against an Australian man who allegedly sexually assaulted babies and children as part of a booming cyber-sex trade. The suspect, Gerard Peter Scully, 51, was arrested in the southern Philippines city of Malaybalay last month after allegedly sexually abusing at least eight girls, including an 18-month-old infant.  He also allegedly strangled one of the girls to death, with her skeleton later discovered buried under a house he had rented, investigators said. The Australian will also be charged with violating the Philippines’ cybercrime laws.  A complaint, filed by Justice Department investigators with the prosecutors’ office, said Scully forced the girls to perform sexual acts in front of a video camera for paying clients overseas. “Let notice be served to these criminal elements that the days of their child cybersex operations are numbered,” Justice Secretary Leila de Lima said in a statement on the case.  “Wherever these syndicates are, we will hunt them down and we will bring them to justice.”  In the complaint outlining the case against Scully, a 13-year-old girl was quoted as saying that her impoverished family agreed she could do domestic work at his home in 2012. But she was instead forced to perform sex acts with other girls, and was beaten by Scully’s Filipina girlfriend when she refused, according to the prosectors’ complaint. “They told me they had to take pictures of me naked because there was an American who really wanted to see me naked… and because the American will pay a large amount,” the complaint quoted her as saying. The girl said she fled Scully’s house after she learned he had sold her to a German national who was coming to collect her, the complaint said.  The head of the anti-human trafficking division of the justice department’s investigating arm, Eric Nuqui, said that Scully had been the subject of an international probe after Netherlands police found out about his activities. If convicted, the Australian could face life in prison. Authorities have warned the Philippines is a major hub of a billion-dollar global child cybersex industry, with operators aided by widespread poverty and legal loopholes that allow them to remain anonymous. Last year, de Lima said that online child abuse was the leading cyber-related crime in the Philippines, making up 46 percent of the more than 200 cases being handled by law-enforcement agencies.;;['Australian', 'charges', 'Children', 'Internet', 'porn', 'sex'];https://globalnation.inquirer.net/119360/philippine-to-charge-australian-on-internet-sex;6
51;OVAC;Cybersex den busted;No news platform;INQUIRER.net;Wed, 10 May 2017 00:01:50 PST;article;"MABALACAT, PAMPANGA—The suspected pedophile could see people banging on his front door. But were they neighbors? Cops? One had letters on her jacket.  As David Timothy Deakin googled “What is NBI?” from the laptop on his bed, National Bureau of Investigation agents smashed their way into his cybersex den. Children’s underwear, toddler shoes, cameras, bondage cuffs, meth pipes and stacks of hard drives cluttered the stuffy, two-bedroom town house.  Penciled on the wall, someone had scrawled “My Mom and Dad love me.” On his computer were videos and images of young boys and girls engaged in sex acts.  “Why is everyone asking about children coming into my house?” said Deakin, 53, bare-chested and slick with sweat, his breath sour and glasses foggy, his wrists bound with a zip tie. Deakin’s arrest on April 20 shows one of the darkest corners of the internet, where pedophiles in the United States, Europe and elsewhere pay facilitators in the Philippines to sexually abuse children, even babies, directing their moves through online livestreaming services. This relatively new crime, webcam sex tourism, is spreading rapidly. The United Nations describes “alarming growth of new forms of child sexual exploitation online.” The FBI says it’s epidemic, and that at any given moment, 750,000 child predators are online.  Almost every case stems from the Philippines, where good English speakers, increased internet connections and widespread international cash transfer systems combine with widespread poverty and easy access to vulnerable kids. There have been as many as three busts a week in the Philippines this spring. The youngest victim ever, rescued a few weeks ago, was an infant, 2 months old. Most are under 12. SUSPECTED PEDOPHILE ARRESTED American David Timothy Deakin, a suspected child webcam cybersex operator, is caught during an NBI raid in Mabalacat, Pampanga province. —AP This spring The Associated Press (AP) watched a raid, rescue and launch of a major investigation that continues to play out on both sides of the world. “This should serve as a warning,” said NBI antihuman trafficking chief Janet Francisco, who led the case. “We will really put them in jail and they will die in jail.” Even as police burst in, Deakin was streaming illicit content through the anonymous Tor network. Agents said he had a webpage open to wipe his phone clean. They tied him up with an iPhone charging cord before he could hit the button. AP and investigators asked him repeatedly why he had the obscene images stored on his computer. “There was no children in front of the cam in my house, not even dressed, as far as I know, not even with their frigging mothers as far as I know,” he said. But he said the images and videos might have slipped in when he downloaded massive files using BitTorrent, a data tool used legitimately by academics and artists, but also by child pornographers.

 FBI agents looking for abusers search BitTorrent to spot people sharing exploitative images. Deakin said he grew up in Peoria, Illinois, in a splintered family. He was licensed as a roofing contractor in his 30s, seasonal work that left winters free; he used the time to study computers. He moved to the Philippines in 2000 for a job setting up internet service providers and installing Blackmagic livestreaming production programs. In recent years, Deakin said, he earned $30 an hour as a systems administrator. But his home was filled with junk, his refrigerator near empty. Stacks of used egg cartons fell from the shelves, and a half-eaten pot of cold rice sat on the stove. “You know what you’ve done in this room,” an investigator told Deakin. She showed him a photo of several children. Shrugging, he said one of them was probably a few doors away with her cousin. Minutes later, two girls, 9 and 11 years old, were rescued by police.

 AP did not interview the girls Deakin told police about; victims of such raids need immediate and long-term counseling and care. But in the tranquil garden of a shelter for sexual exploitation survivors 96 kilometers south of Deakin’s town house, 19-year-old Cassie described her ordeal. AP did not use her whole name to protect her privacy. The youngest daughter in an impoverished family, Cassie believed the man who came to her village promising a better life if she’d go to the city with him. She was 12. Within months the man bleached her dark skin, straightened her hair, and began waking her at 4 a.m. to work. “He needed some girl to show her whole body in front of the camera,” she said. The abuse ended when her older sister found out and went to the police. Some buyers try to brush off the abuse, saying they’re not directly touching the children. GOTCHA A suspected cybersex operator, American David Timothy Deakin, is caught by National Bureau of Investigation agents in a house in Mabalacat, Pampanga province. The United Nations has described as alarming the growth of new forms of child sexual exploitation online. —AP “It’s not just a virtual crime. It is an actual crime,” said human rights lawyer Sam Inocencio, who heads International Justice Mission’s Philippines office, which supports local law enforcement with investigators and lawyers. “Online sexual exploitation is possibly the most evil thing that I’ve seen,” Inocencio added. In 2013, online sex exploitation of children gained global attention after researchers at the Netherlands-based nonprofit Terre des Hommes launched a realistic-looking animation of a 10-year-old Filipino girl named Sweetie.

 They took the fake girl on chat groups and online forums. Pedophiles swarmed. In 10 weeks, analysts identified 1,000 men in 71 countries who had tried to get illegal images. The proliferation of crimes, along with new mandatory reporting, led to 8.2 million reports last year to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children’s CyberTipline related to online child sexual exploitation. That compares with 8.3 million reports in the 17 years prior. Officials at both ends of the abuse agree they need to collaborate to stop it, and last month the United States committed $3 million. Deakin’s bust turned out to be one of the largest seizures of its kind in the Philippines. His Cherry Mobile Touch HD tablet—which can be wiped clean and reset with a four digit code—had more than 4,000 contacts. One computer had another 13 networked into it, from servers he said were around the world. There were 30 hard drives. Neighbor Bessie Geronimo was teary-eyed. She’d seen children going in and out. Now, she wondered, could she have intervened? “Oh, I pity those children,” she said.

 Authorities from a village police substation said a housekeeper filed a complaint against Deakin last year: He wasn’t paying her, she said, and she was worried about what he was doing with children in the bedroom with the door closed. They visited his house but had no authority for a raid. “There are many such places,” said the security officer, Mike Wood. —AP";Editors' Picks;No Tags;https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/895580/cybersex-den-busted;6

Deakin’s arrest reveals one of the darkest corners of the internet, where pedophiles in the US, Canada, Europe and Australia pay facilitators on the other side of the world to sexually abuse children, directing their moves through online live-streaming services. AP FILE STRASBOURG, France – A man has been charged with ordering videos of rapes and sexual assaults, some of them on children, broadcast live from the Philippines, a French prosecutor said on Saturday. The suspect, a 55-year-old former police officer according to L’Est Republicain newspaper, was being held for conspiracy to commit rape and sexual assault on someone under 15 years of age, Francois Perain, prosecutor in the eastern city of Nancy, told AFP.  French officials were tipped off by the investigators at the US Department of Homeland Security of the activities of a French national between 2017 and 2018, said Perain. They had picked up the trail after equipment seized in a raid on a suspect in the Philippines yielded evidence of the live-streamed sexual assaults.  The system involved broadcasting the assaults live and charging people to view them and the victims, some of whom were children, said the prosecutor. Using online chatrooms, clients placed orders specifying the profile of the victim and how they wanted them to be assaulted and paid $15-60.  Although some videos are broadcast pre-recorded, others are broadcast live so the person who ordered it can influence what happens in real time, said Perain.  The suspect admitted to investigators that he had paid for such videos but said very few of them had involved minors, the prosecutor added. /cbb;Europe;['child abuse', 'Child Pornography', 'Child Rape', 'Features', 'France', 'Philippines', 'video streaming'];https://globalnation.inquirer.net/173390/man-charged-for-ordering-philippines-child-rape-videos;6
56;OVAC;S. Korea curbs minors’ YouTube appearances, content;The Korea Herald/Asia News Network;The Korea Herald/Asia News Network;Tue, 30 Jun 2020 17:13:57 PST;article;(Yonhap) SEOUL — South Korea announced a set of guidelines for minors’ appearances on YouTube and content on Tuesday in an effort to protect their human rights. The measures, unveiled by the Korea Communications Commission, advise children and teens not to appear on YouTube or other internet broadcasting programs for three or more hours on end.  They will also be recommended not to emcee live internet broadcasting programs or appear on them for six hours a day, and not to appear on programs between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. Restrictions will be put on content that contains the abuse of minors or can be misunderstood as abusive.  In addition, children and teens should not be exposed to physical violence and risks, excessive emotional anxiety or fear. The guidelines also limit the creation of content that is obscene, induces a speculative spirit, and fuels racism or discrimination.  “The need for such guidelines has been raised amid controversies over child abuse and sexual harassment in the wake of a surge in internet broadcasting programs featuring children and teens,” the commission said.  The rules also cover producers and guardians of children and teens appearing on internet broadcasting programs. YouTube and other platform providers should observe the rules as well, according to the commission. (Yonhap);Internet;['Children', 'Human Rights', 'Internet', 'minors', 'South Korea', 'technology', 'Youtube'];https://technology.inquirer.net/101540/s-korea-curbs-minors-youtube-appearances-content;6
61;OVAC;US sex abuser of PH kids gets 60 years in prison;INQUIRER.net US Bureau;INQUIRER.net US Bureau;Tue, 13 Sep 2016 00:11:30 PST;article;"Convicted child sex abuser Steven Rockett. PRISON PHOTO PORTLAND, Oregon – A US federal court judge sentenced a 47-year-old Forest Grove man to 60 years in prison for sexually abusing children in the Philippines U.S. District Judge Michael H. Simon on Thursday, Sept. 8, sentenced Steven Douglas Rockett to 60 years in federal prison followed by a life term of supervised release.  Rockett was convicted by a federal jury in Portland, Oregon after a seven-day trial in May of this year, for producing child pornography outside the United States, engaging in illicit sexual conduct in foreign places, producing and attempting to produce child pornography (five counts) and possession of child pornography. Prosecutors presented victim impact statements from Filipino child victims as well as statements from Rockett’s victims in Oregon. The prosecutors urged the court to impose a sentence of no less than 60 years – 45 consecutive to Rockett’s 52.5-year sentence in Oregon State court for crimes committed against a number of different victims.  Rockett’s attorneys requested the mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years, imposed to run concurrently with Rockett’s state sentence, which is presently on appeal. “One of civil society’s most important duties and obligations is to protect the most vulnerable among us. Children are the most vulnerable,” observed Judge Simon before agreeing with the prosecution’s recommendation and sentencing Rockett to 60 years – 45 to be served consecutive to the Rockett’s state sentence.  ‘Extremely serious offenses’  Judge Simon noted that these were “extremely serious offenses.”  He expressed doubt that Rockett could refrain from committing further crimes if released from prison. Judge Simon imposed a sentence designed to ensure that Rockett would not harm any other children stating, “I don’t think you are capable of restraining yourself.” The evidence presented at trial established that Rockett traveled to the Philippines, where he sexually abused Filipino children, and produced or attempted to produce child pornography depicting them. Rockett solicited children (either directly or through a parent) both in the Philippines and in Oregon, to take and send him sexually explicit images of themselves. In addition, Rockett surreptitiously recorded children undressing and showering at his residence in Forest Grove, at a former residence in Aloha, and in hotel rooms in the Philippines. Collaborative investigation  The investigation was a collaborative effort on the part of the Forest Grove Police Department, the Washington County Sheriff’s Office, and the FBI. Investigators executed search warrants at Rockett’s residence, and seized computer equipment and digital data storage devices. Investigators found a pinhole camera hidden in a wall in a guest bathroom, which Rockett used to record images of naked children. Another spy camera, hidden inside a clock radio, contained surreptitious video recordings of naked Filipino children in the bathroom and shower of Rockett’s hotel room. Rockett appeared in some of the videos. FBI Special Agents traveled to Cebu City, Philippines, where they identified and interviewed some of the victims depicted in the videos, and some of the children who Rockett solicited to send him sexually explicit images. The jury heard testimony from seven victims who were sexually abused or exploited by Rockett in Oregon and overseas. The jury deliberated several hours before reaching their verdict. “This sentence is a just and deserving punishment for a dangerous sexual predator, and reflects the life-long impact his conduct will have on his victims,” said Billy J. Williams, U.S. Attorney for the District of Oregon.” Williams added, “We will not tolerate American citizens traveling abroad to sexually abuse children. Child sexual predators like Steven Rockett must understand that the sexual exploitation of children carries severe consequences, as Judge Simon’s sentence clearly demonstrates.” Life behind bars “Effectively, Steven Rockett will, rightfully, live the rest of his life behind bars. I would ask the community to remember that the innocent children who suffered his abuse will also pay a heavy price for many years to come,” said Greg Bretzing, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI in Oregon. “No child deserves to live a life of violence and violation, and it is our responsibility to bring justice to them and their families.” This case stemmed from a coordinated investigation by members of the FBI Child Exploitation Task Force and was brought as part of Project Safe Childhood, a nationwide initiative to combat the growing epidemic of child sexual exploitation and abuse. Launched in May 2006 by the U.S. Department of Justice and led by United States Attorneys’ Offices and the Criminal Division’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (CEOS), Project Safe Childhood marshals federal, state, and local resources to better locate, apprehend, and prosecute individuals who exploit children via the Internet, as well as to identify and rescue victims.

62;OVAC;Asap!;Philippine Daily Inquirer;Philippine Daily Inquirer;Sun, 24 Aug 2014 00:30:40 PST;article;"Despite the fact that Filipinos traditionally highly treasure children in their midst, sexual abuse and exploitation of children tragically remain common in Philippine society. Adding to this poignant irony is that even as the clamor for greater vigilance against child abuse is spreading worldwide, incidents of rape and murder of children in both urban and rural settings in our country continue to be reported with seeming regularity, many of them perpetrated by those who are supposed to care for them. One of the most chilling perhaps was the rape-slay of 11-month-old Geraline Cortes in San Juan City; the infant’s violated body was left under a parked passenger jeepney. In another incident, at an evacuation camp in Zamboanga City, a 6-year-old girl was raped by her own grandfather. Last February, a 14-year-old girl was found dismembered in North Cotabato. The horrific killings and rapes are simply startling to fathom as handiworks of human beings.  But it gets even worse. Some are making money from this horror. The production of porn videos, featuring Filipino children (male and female), being offered to pedophiles online by their own parents no less, have become a profitable cottage industry. Earlier this month, a mother was arrested in Taguig City by the National Bureau of Investigation  for running a cybersex den and for using her own 10-year-old daughter in the trade. “They do not want me. My clients want young girls so I asked my daughter to do the show,” the mother said, claiming she needed to run the illicit business to pay the bills. In March, police arrested two women in Davao City for forcing their seven children—one as young as two years old—to perform sexual acts transmitted via the Internet for foreign clients. It turns the stomach to hear one investigating officer’s account about the women’s staple American client: “Sometimes he’d call them one by one. Sometimes, he’d call five of them at the same time. The children would stand in a corner, stark naked, waiting for who’s next.” Even more alarming, online video streaming of child pornography has been tracked in 31 of our country’s 81 provinces, with a BBC Special Report counting between 60,000 and 100,000 Filipino children-victims thus far.  This outrage has no place in a civilized, human community. Society can’t sit back and just watch with cold indifference as the list of victims grows longer. We therefore strongly support Sen. Miriam Defensor Santiago’s bill seeking to prevent sexual abuse of children or at least minimize their vulnerability to the crime. Santiago would have the children, from Kindergarten to Grade 8, armed with the information they need to prevent sexual abuse and exploitation. “The incidence of child sexual abuse, child sexual exploitation and child abduction can be reduced by raising awareness among young children of common dangers and warning signs, empowering children to better protect themselves from sexual predators, and teaching children how to obtain any necessary assistance or services,” Santiago stated in her bill’s explanatory note. This kind of preventive, classroom-based measure is not exactly new. Similar measures have taken hold in the United States.  After being raped by a neighbor and abused by a family member and threatened with harm if she squeaked, Illinois girl Erin Merryn chose to remain silent about her ordeal. But later finding courage to speak out, Merryn helped push a law that has been named after her—“Erin Merryn’s Law”—which requires sexual abuse awareness for students K-to-12 in her home state, an act replicated in 18 other states. New York State passed the law in April, with state Sen. David Valesky speaking strongly about the subject. “As a society, we must do whatever we can to prevent sexual abuse of children,” Valesky said. “Erin’s Law will require schools to add to existing curricula and provide children with age-appropriate information about ways to get help. By giving children a means to feel safe so they can speak up, we can get them out of horrible situations as well as catch and punish their abusers.”  By “raising awareness among young children of common dangers and warning signs” Santiago’s bill, to be sure, once enacted into law, can reduce child abuse, exploitation and abduction here. In a country where many are loath to discuss any aspect of sex in classrooms, Santiago’s bill is bound to raise a lot of eyebrows. But unless there is another way, the bill should become law, Asap!";Editorial;['children', 'crime', 'Editorial', 'internet', 'online', 'opinion', 'Rape'];https://opinion.inquirer.net/77780/asap;7

Alicia (not her real name) pleaded guilty to the charges of attempted trafficking, child pornography, child abuse, and voyeurism lodged against her, said a statement from the International Justice Mission (IJM). It also said that Presiding Judge Ramon Daomilas Jr. of the Regional Trial Court in Cebu City Branch 11 ordered the suspect to pay P1.5 million in fines and damages.  Enforcers from the Women and Child Protection Center-Visayas Field Unit of the Philippine National Police (PNP) rescued Alicia’s two daughters – then aged five and two – and another five-year-old girl in an entrapment operation conducted on July 30, 2016 in Cordova town, Cebu.   Authorities recovered from Alicia’s residence transfer receipts believed to have come from the suspect’s transactions with online sex predators.  Lawyer John Tanagho, IJM-Cebu Field Office director, lauded the outcome of the trial.  “Today’s conviction reflects excellent investigations by WCPC and prosecutions by DOJ. The evidence in OSEC (online sexual exploitation of children) cases is so strong that the accused are often pleading guilty, even to long sentences of 15 years or longer,” Tanagho said in the IJM statement.  “This leads to excellent results of timely justice for the survivors and protects child victims from having to testify in court to their abuse. People selling the live-streaming of child sexual abuse think it’s an easy way to make money, but really it’s just a sure way to get arrested and go to jail,” he added.  Cordova Mayor Mary Therese Sitoy-Cho hailed the conviction of the suspect. “We feel that this victory is not about penalizing or punishing the perpetrators, who usually are close relatives of the victims, even the parents themselves. But this is more about finding justice and rebuilding the lives and future of our children,” Sitoy-Cho said in the same statement.;No news category;No Tags;https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/223384/cordovas-cyberporn-trafficker-gets-26-years-in-prison;7
64;OVAC;Groups seek firmer implementation of DICT policy to protect kids online;INQUIRER.net;Consuelo Marquez;Tue, 11 Feb 2020 21:51:24 PST;article;MANILA, Philippines — A consortium of child rights groups is appealing to the government to heighten the implementation of the Child Online Safeguarding Policy (COSP) under the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) to prevent children from being exploited online. “The COSP is meant to provide protection to children who will access the Free Wi-Fi in communities because mechanisms and standards such as blacklisting and warnings in the captive portals are to be standardized and easily accessible,” read the statement from Safer Kids Philippines.  “So that children and their parents will be informed of the risks when navigating cyberspace and how to report when online harm is experienced,” it added. The COSP was put up in compliance with the Free Internet Access in Public Places Act, which requires the DICT to develop standards and mechanisms for protecting children online.  As child rights groups observe Safer Internet Day in the country, Safer Kids Philippines underscored the importance of awareness of online sexual exploitation of children. Citing the Philippine Kids Online Survey, Safer Kids PH said 90% of Filipino children have access to the internet whenever they and 59% connect to the internet “without supervision.”  Safer Kids Philippines consists of the Australian Embassy, Save the Children, The Asia Foundation and UNICEF. /atm;Metro;['child rights group', 'DICT', 'online protection of children', 'online sexual abuse and exploitation of children\xa0', 'Safer Kids Philippines'];https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1227433/safer-kids-ph-calls-for-stronger-implementation-of-child-online-safeguarding-policy;7
65;OVAC;With no closure from justice system, Filipino victims of sexual misconduct call out abusers online;INQUIRER.net;Niña V. Guno;Wed, 22 Jan 2020 19:08:01 PST;article;"Image: INQUIRER.net/Marie Faro (Last of three parts in an in-depth series.) Calling out has existed far before the word “viral” was tied to online posts. It has been traced to black women, particularly black feminists whose voices have been shut out of the mainstream on issues such as racism and sexism. It has also been associated with public shaming, a practice once popular centuries ago and is now seeing a resurgence on social media.  Like public shaming, calling out has been criticized for inciting mob justice. However, for marginalized communities — such as women of color — it is at times the only recourse after attempting to deal with issues on their own. But first, what is calling out?  “Moving away from the academic definition, I just call it holding people accountable for either socially or maybe morally irresponsible behavior,” said Jason Cruz, executive strategy director of ad agency Wizard Manila. Cruz estimated that calling out became a global trend on social media around 2014 to 2015. “In the States, it started from the black community, calling out injustices to their communities, to their culture, to the fact that they get abused but from a more institutional level,” he said.  In the Philippines, women are taking to social media to talk about their experiences of sexual misconduct, at times naming their perpetrators. It is rare that such an account takes place right after the abuse is committed — often, the incident occurred years ago. There are a host of factors on why it takes time for victims to speak up, says Nellen dela Fuente, a social worker at Tahanan Sta. Luisa in Rizal, a crisis intervention and recovery center for sexually abused street kids. These include feelings of shame and fear; others stay in denial about what happened to them. In some cases, the incident is forgotten due to the trauma experienced, and memories return only after a triggering situation. Filipinos’ non-confrontational culture, as well as a concern for community, may also affect how justice is sought. “As Filipinos who are mostly others-centered and palaging may malasakit sa kapwa (always have compassion for neighbors) almost to a fault, victims would likely put others first before themselves, even their own perpetrator,” child psychologist and psychosocial worker Dindi Sandoval said. Fed up with rape culture, justice system  While a call-out can mention one perpetrator, it is also seen as taking a stand against rape culture, which perpetuates victim-blaming and normalizes men committing sexual violence. Based on trends in the United States, the demographics of those who are likely to participate in call-out culture “lean more towards [the] liberal, progressive thinking,” said Cruz. In the Philippines, those who call out could be “more globally exposed” and would have “more progressive, more modern academic backgrounds.” The socioeconomic background of one who would call out is likely middle to upper class since they have regular internet access and have a “safety net” which is needed in facing possible legal blows, Cruz said. He noted that a victim from an impoverished background may not feel empowered to speak up online without the money and influence of those who are more privileged. Cruz said that social media is the “platform of choice” because it is a quick and free way to get attention. It also provides some degree of insulation, since calling out is done behind a screen. “[Social media] gives you a little bit more courage and also it protects you from jeering looks or judgmental commentary from authorities that you are reporting it to,” Cruz said. Sandoval, who has worked with victims of trauma under the MLAC (Mindfulness, Love and Compassion) Pyschosocial Services Inc., explained that those who speak up online find healing in sharing their trauma. “By merely being able to share it with someone, anyone who can listen with compassion, can help ward off feelings of depression and can even prevent suicide,” she said. Another reason: seeking justice. “Many call out because they are very frustrated with the justice system,” said Women’s Legal Bureau (WLB) executive director Jelen Paclarin, who has been in the organization for 19 years. WLB was founded to represent women in courts for free but now only provide legal advice, given the struggle to fund cases that can last 10 to 15 years. Barriers to justice

 In the Philippines, there is no dearth of laws that can protect women against sexual violence: these include the Anti-Rape Law and the Revised Penal Code, which cover acts of lasciviousness and seduction. But implementing these laws effectively and with sensitivity to those who file cases is another matter. When victims do report to authorities, they face prejudice, especially if social workers or police officers are not trained to be gender-sensitive, according to Liz Kollin, program officer for sexual violence of WLB. Rather than be believed, women are doubted based on what they wore and whether they “look like a rape victim,” the stereotype of which is a woman who is “young, pretty or desirable.” These false notions have been disproven by Supreme Court cases — an 8-month-old baby has been a rape victim, as stated in “Making Sense of Rape”, a published review of Supreme Court decisions by WLB. Still, these notions remain prevalent and can make going through the justice system sometimes even more traumatizing than the act of sexual violence itself. Paclarin says that if a woman is knowledgeable of the legal process, she is said to be taking advantage of it; if she is not, she is considered “passive” to her situation. Victim-blaming and the psychological toll it takes are only some of the barriers to seeking justice. A lack of knowledge of the legal process, lack of a support system (such as family and NGOs to assist in the process), displacement (such as moving away or resigning from a job to get away from the perpetrator), and expenses from years of litigation can deter victims from pursuing a case. Cautions against calling out Paclarin warns that those calling out should be ready for the exposure and its repercussions, such as getting backlash for making an accusation online. Those who call out tend to be bullied and threatened, and can even be slapped with a cyberlibel case. “You have to recognize the difference between the social activism of sexual violence vis-à-vis corruption. You’re sharing personal information about yourself that can be used against you in the future,” she said, advising those who plan to call out to be selective of the information which will be released. “By sharing something too private and taboo, one is subjecting himself or herself to malicious and indifferent comments that can do more harm than good,” said Sandoval. The credibility of online allegations has also been put into question given how easy it can be to post false accusations, or that a call-out can turn into bullying by strangers who automatically take sides.

 Trish*, who called out her once-best friend Bryan* for taking advantage of her while she was unconscious, did not find cruel comments to him helpful. “You can give your support to someone without terrorizing the perpetrator. I’m not asking you to burn his house down or message him with hate, just believe me,” she said. She also stressed that victims, especially women like her, would not deal with calling out if what they said was false. “We [women] have long been marginalized. We didn’t have the opportunity to talk about it,” she said. “There are people possibly abusing it, and they say people could lose jobs on false accusations. That isn’t the fault of the victims,” she stressed. “That’s on the company who didn’t investigate. #MeToo is supposed to get the attention of those who should be handling it, like employers who should investigate it.” Online clamor turns into offline action Whatever one’s opinion of calling out is, receiving online backlash — or the fear of it — has recently pressured even academic and literary institutions to take action on allegations of sexual harassment made against its members. The courses of action have received mixed feedback, but it is at least a step forward from merely hushing up rumors on sexual predators. One observed response to calling out sexual harassment has been to preempt the call out, as in the case of esteemed poetry collective and publication High Chair. In October, it came to light that High Chair had folded up as sexual harassment allegations toward some of its members had “divided/demoralized the group,” even if there had been no previous news or online posts about such incidents. No other details were revealed, though speculations in the literary community are that those involved may be High Chair writers who were not listed as signatories of the statement on its site. These include male poets who are also professors. Last October, members of the Ateneo de Manila University (ADMU) community launched a protest following students’ social media posts about the alleged predatory behavior of certain professors and how the university was handling sexual misconduct allegations. The uproar from the faculty and students questioned the lack of transparency on the progress of such cases. It led to a closed-door meeting on Oct. 18 among the administration, students and faculty. University president Jett Villarin, S.J. apologized to the community, stating, “There is much we can do to make our processes more responsive, more efficient, more sensitive, more caring and more Christian.” Days later, Villarin stated in a memo on Oct. 23 that no formal complaint for sexual harassment had been lodged against professors who were called out online, namely Mary Thomas and Jesus Deogracias Principe. Professors from the English department have also defended Thomas’ character and condemned the accusations against her.

 A coalition of university students, faculty and alumni founded Time’s Up Ateneo on Oct. 15 to “consolidate efforts against sexual violence and impunity,” according to its Facebook page. It called for a no-contact order for Thomas and Principe, and argued in an open letter on Oct. 24 that “stringent requirements” prevent cases from becoming formalized. In another case involving a different incident and institution, a call-out has progressed into legal action. In early August, science fiction writer and journalist Timothy James “TJ” Dimacali was accused of raping a poetry fellow while she was drunk at the closing ceremony of the Iligan National Writers Workshop (INWW). He was a keynote speaker and panelist at the said workshop. The victim released a statement on Facebook in August following speculations on social media that an incident of sexual assault occurred at the workshop’s celebrations last May 2019. She did not name Dimacali. She also said that she does not recall giving him consent to do sexual acts, including oral sex. The organizer of the event, the Mindanao Creative Writers Group, Inc. (MCWG), said in a now-deleted statement on Facebook, through workshop director Christine Godinez Ortega, that it made an investigation and found that the incident was “a private matter between two consenting adults.” The statement only came after the online clamor, even when the victim did report the incident 10 days after it occurred. The statement also named the aggrieved party but not Dimacali. Artist groups and women’s groups decried the statement, calling for an independent investigation. Meanwhile, Dimacali denied the accusations in a Facebook post and submitted an affidavit to the Commission on Human Rights (CHR). The victim filed a rape and sexual harassment complaint before the city prosecutor’s office in Iligan on Nov. 14, as per Mindanao Gold Star Daily. Society’s role in ending sexual violence As seen in the cases above, calling out online is able to not only raise awareness on sexual violence and the culture that permits it — it is also able to do so in a manner quicker than if one had to go through the hoops of the justice system or call the attention of mainstream media. But social media call-outs should not be the only means of addressing sexual violence; the fact that it is resorted to should be cause for alarm. Efforts need to be focused on preventing sexual violence, which can be done in changing the way kids are raised, and making victims feel safe to report abuses and to heal from trauma. Call-outs of sexual violence refute myths of who or what a perpetrator is. Most of those called out tend to be someone trusted by the victim and respected by the community: a friend, a partner or even a mentor such as a teacher. Such close relationships make speaking out more daunting for victims, said Sandoval. That most acts of violence are committed by men is a symptom of how boys are raised into men. Masculine ideals like sexual potency and physical strength come with unrealistic standards, according to research of renowned sociologist Raewyn Connell. When they are unable to reach these so-called ideals, they become insecure and entitled in asserting power — such as hurting women when their advances are rejected.";Nation;No Tags;https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1218211/with-no-closure-from-justice-system-filipino-victims-of-sexual-misconduct-call-out-abusers-online;7
66;OVAC;Europol using everyday objects to trace child sex abusers;Agence France-Presse;Agence France-Presse;Thu, 01 Jun 2017 07:36:47 PST;article;A Europol police agent looks at the onscreen logo of a new website launched by Europol at the Europol headquarters in The Hague on May 31, 2017. A particular shampoo brand, a magazine cover, a shopping bag or even a pattern on wallpaper are some clues Europol posted online on June 1, 2017, hoping it will help investigators identify child sex abuse victims. AFP THE HAGUE, Netherlands — A particular shampoo brand, a magazine cover, a shopping bag or even a wallpaper pattern are among the clues Europol posted online Thursday, hoping they may help trace child sex abusers and their victims. Europe’s police agency launched a new website that shows everyday objects spotted in the background of child sex abuse images, which they hope will help police around the world to crack the case, leading them to victims and to the arrest of perpetrators.  The 20 images on the site, called “Stop Child Abuse – Trace an Object” feature “mundane objects… which can sometimes end up being a key lead in an investigation, resulting in the victims’ identification and rescue,” said Steven Wilson, chief of Europol’s EC3 Cybercrime centre. Europol unveiled the images at its fortress-like headquarters in The Hague on Thursday, where Wilson asked for help from the public to identify the items on the site.  There are even distinctive markings on a victim’s clothes — such as a kitten or a unicorn — or a picture of a snow-filled field with homes in the background, believed to have been taken by one victim. “We’re looking to identify particular parts, particular items in there that may be unique to a particular region in the world, a particular country or even a particular town or village,” Wilson told AFP.  “From that we can then work very closely with other law enforcement authorities and actually identify the people responsible for this.” The website found at www.europol.europa.eu/stopchildabuse is designed to enable anonymous tip-offs, Wilson said. “Once the origin of an object is identified, Europol will work with the relevant police forces in a country and hopefully that will lead to the identification of the victim and the arrest of the offender,” he said. Europol last year warned that online child pornography including the live-streaming of child sexual abuse was on the rise. In the Netherlands, a newspaper report said Wednesday that Dutch police were for the first time describing child pornography as a “national threat.”  Criminals and paedophile networks often use the “Dark Web” and the Tor encryption system to mask their identities and distribute child sex abuse images online. “This project seeks to use the global reach of the internet to allow the public to contribute to this investigation and play a real part to prevent global child abuse,” Europol chief Rob Wainwright said.  CBB;World;No Tags;https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/901531/europol-using-everyday-objects-to-trace-child-sex-abusers;7
67;OVAC;Tumblr bans porn to clean up the blogging platform;Agence France-Presse;Agence France-Presse;Tue, 04 Dec 2018 08:47:55 PST;article; SAN FRANCISCO, United States – Tumblr on Monday said it is banning adult content from the Yahoo-owned blogging platform, which saw its app pulled from Apple’s App Store last month over child pornography.  Tumblr will begin enforcing its new policy on December 17, giving users who host unwanted explicit content an opportunity to take their imagery elsewhere, according to chief executive Jeff D’Onofrio. “There are no shortage of sites on the internet that feature adult content,” D’Onofrio said in a blog post.  “We will leave it to them and focus our efforts on creating the most welcoming environment possible for our community.” The decision to purge porn from Tumblr was made after “serious thought” regarding standards in the blogging community, according to the chief executive.  “Posts that contain adult content will no longer be allowed on Tumblr, and we’ve updated our Community Guidelines to reflect this policy change,” D’Onofrio said.  He maintained that Tumblr will strive to balance allowing conversation about topics such as sex and relationships with banning porn, and noted there are likely to be stumbles. Child porn was already against Tumblr guidelines. “Posting anything that is harmful to minors, including child pornography, is abhorrent and has no place in our community,” D’Onofrio said. “We’ve always had and always will have a zero tolerance policy for this type of content.”  Tumblr’s applications for Apple devices were shut out of the App Store last month after child sexual abuse material was found on the platform. Tumblr uses an industry database to filter content being uploaded, but child porn material that had not yet been added to the database made it onto the platform, the company said. The offending content was removed as soon as it was discovered in a routine audit, according to Tumblr. D’Onofrio took over as chief of Tumblr from founder David Karp late last year. Karp’s departure from the company came a few months after Verizon bought parent-company Yahoo in a $4.5 billion deal. Karp founded Tumblr in New York in early 2007 as a platform where people could share writing and short-form media. Now, Tumblr hosts some 417 million different blogs. Yahoo acquired Tumblr in May 2013 for $1.1 billion, as part of an effort to better connect with younger online users. /cbb;Online Transactions;['App Store', 'Apple', 'Blogs', 'Child Pornography', 'porn', 'Social Media', 'Tumblr'];https://technology.inquirer.net/81786/tumblr-bans-porn-to-clean-up-the-blogging-platform;8
68;OVAC;Europe’s most wanted sex offender caught in Cebu, 8 rescued;No news platform;No Author;Thu, 25 Jul 2019 20:11:52 PST;No news type;Photo contributed by the Women and Children Protection Center – Visayas Field Unit. CEBU CITY, Philippines – One of the most wanted sex offenders in Europe for child abuse and exploitation was arrested in Barangay Luz in Cebu City following a joint operation by National Bureau of Investigation -Anti-Human Trafficking Division (NBI- AHTRAD) and the Philippine National Police – Women and Children Protection Center (PNP-WCPC) on April 12, 2019. Nelson Siacor Torayno, 32, was arrested at his rented room where thousands of images, including videos depicting children being sexually abused by an adult, were found in his possession. Torayno has been producing and distributing child sexual exploitation materials (CSEM) on the dark-web and has abused children in the process. He faces charges of possession of CSEM with intent to sell, distribute, publish or broadcast, committed through the use of information communications technology.  Partner agencies from the Philippine Internet Crimes Against Children Center (PICACC) – namely, the Australian Federal Police (AFP), the United Kingdom National Crime Agency (NCA), and non-government organization, the International Justice Mission (IJM) – supported the operation. According to a joint statement of law enforcement agencies involved in the operation, they took time to release to the media the arrest of Torayno due to an ongoing investigation related to the arrest. The statement said Torayno was identified as one of the most wanted sex offenders in Europe by the the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (Europol). During the operation in Cebu, a total of eight children – neighbors and acquaintances of the suspect, were also rescued. On the day of the suspect’s arrest, two girls presented themselves to local barangay officials as the search warrant was served to Torayno. They reported how the suspect touched them inappropriately as they walked a narrow alley, and also revealed the suspect’s connections to another 3-year-old boy and his two siblings. Police then went to the house of the children mentioned and with the parents’ participation, led them to the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) for assessment. On the same day, a 10-year-old boy was rescued in the municipality of Liloan, Cebu. The following day, two boys, both 8 years old, were rescued in Iligan City. Torayno met the 10-year-old boy in an internet shop in Liloan. Without parental supervision, the boy frequented the store to play games, which the suspect would pay for, in order to befriend the boy. In time, the suspect was able to lure the boy to another location where the sexual abuse took place. The International Justice Mission (IJM) said in a statement that all children rescued, including five from Cebu City, whose ages range from 3 to 11,  had been reintegrated back to their families and would continue to receive trauma-informed interventions. Lawyer Janet Francisco, NBI-AHTRAD chief,  said that Torayno’s arrest was a testament to their commitment and resolve to fight online sexual exploitation of children (OSEC). “It was a group effort, and a clear demonstration of how collaboration works, to our advantage. Certainly, there are others like him out there waiting for the opportunity to prey on helpless children, but one thing is more certain, that we are likewise waiting for the opportunity to get them!” she said. Police Brigadier General William Macavinta, PNP-WCPC chief, said he was ashamed that Europol’s number one on the list of sexual offenders is a Filipino, who had abused numerous Filipino children. “The message is very clear. Regardless of the nationality of the perpetrator or wherever he is, the WCPC will support (those) working under PICACC to ensure global cooperation and response until the Philippines is protected from those who victimize our innocent children using the internet,” Macavinta said. Lawyer Lucille Dejito, International Justice Mission Cebu director of legal interventions, commended the work of the PNP and NBI. She also called on Western governments to strengthen sentencing for those, who would create the demand for these exploitative materials. “By addressing not only the supply but also the demand side of this global crime, governments together can effectively shrink the space for impunity. If there is no demand for OSEC, there won’t be the supply, and children wouldn’t have to be commoditized over the internet in these degrading ways,” Dejito said. /dbs;No news category;No Tags;https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/247278/europes-most-wanted-sex-offender-caught-in-cebu-8-rescued;8
69;OVAC;Filipina arrested on federal child porn charges in New Mexico;INQUIRER.net US Bureau;INQUIRER.net US Bureau;2018-07-10T17:16:06+00:00;article; ALBUQUERQUE, New Mexico – Jade Tiffany Laurezo, 34, a native of the Philippines, made her initial appearance July 5, 2018 in federal court in Roswell, New Mexico, on a criminal complaint charging her with possessing child pornography.  Laurezo, who has been in the United States for several months on a visitor’s visa, remains in federal custody pending a preliminary hearing and a detention hearing, both of which are scheduled for July 11, 2018, in Las Cruces, New Mexico. According to the criminal complaint, the investigation leading to Laurezo’s arrest began in March 2018, when the Chaves County Sheriff’s Office (CCSO) followed up on a report from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children regarding an email address subscribed to a Roswell residence where Laurezo was residing  that allegedly was used to upload three files of child pornography.  On June 27, 2018, the CCSO executed a state search warrant at the residence. While executing the search warrant, the officers seized a cellular phone, which allegedly belonged to Laurezo.  On July 3, 2018, the CCSO executed a state search warrant on the cellular phone and found that it contained four videos of child pornography.  If convicted of possession of child pornography, Laurezo faces up to ten years of imprisonment and will be deported after completing any prison sentence imposed.  Charges in criminal complaints are merely accusations and defendants are presumed innocent unless found guilty in a court of law. This case was investigated by the Roswell office of the FBI, Homeland Security Investigations, and the Chaves County Sheriff’s Office.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Alexander B. Shapiro of the U.S. Attorney’s Las Cruces Branch Office is prosecuting the case as part of Project Safe Childhood, a nationwide initiative launched in May 2006 by the Department of Justice (DOJ) to combat the growing epidemic of child sexual exploitation and abuse. The case also was brought as a part of the New Mexico Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) Task Force’s mission, which is to locate, track, and capture Internet child sexual predators and Internet child pornographers in New Mexico. ;No news category;['Chaves County Sheriff’s Office (CCSO', 'child pornography', 'Filipina child porn defendant', 'internet pornography', 'Jade Tiffany Laurezo', 'National Center for Missing and Exploited Children', 'New Mexico District Attorney', 'sex crime'];https://usa.inquirer.net/13757/filipina-arrested-federal-child-porn-charges-new-mexico;8
70;OVAC;Crucial agreement;Philippine Daily Inquirer;Philippine Daily Inquirer;Sun, 16 Apr 2017 01:14:44 PST;article;Amid the shifting conditions of the historic bond shared by the Philippines and the United States, they signed an agreement that is absolutely crucial. The two countries signed on April 11  the Child Protection Compact (CPC),  which is aimed at reinforcing the battle  against child abuse and trafficking. Under the agreement, the United States  will provide $3.5 million (P175 million) and the Philippines’ Inter-Agency Council Against Trafficking (Iacat) P40 million for programs and organizations with the intention of improving  the investigation, prosecution, identification  and monitoring of those involved in online sex abuse and trafficking.  As horrific as it is to imagine, child pornography and trafficking have been amplified by the vast reach of the internet, and fighting these crimes now requires greater resources and attention such as provided by the CPC. “Let us not leave no stone unturned in our avowed purpose to protect our children. Let us send a message, a strong one at that. Hurt our children, and we  will come after you. And you will not like it,” Justice Secretary and Iacat chair Vitaliano Aguirre II said at the signing ceremony. “Let us invest in our children. They are our hope. They are our future… Anything that debases or [dehumanizes] the dignity of a person is an abomination that must end,” said US Chargé d’Affaires Michael S. Klecheski. The two countries have assisted each other in the recent past to end at least one child porn and trafficking operation in Dasmariñas, Cavite. In what has become the common criminal practice, the sisters Elvie and Arlene Aringo made children engage in sex, filmed them, and distributed the videos online to foreign clients for up to $100. Some of the clients reportedly even came to the country to engage in actual sex with the children for at least P10,000. Based on information shared by US sources, the National Bureau of Investigation arrested the sisters in March, shut down the operation, and rescued 13 minors.  The hugely lucrative child porn trade in the Philippines is intended almost entirely for foreign pedophiles. “There is no interest in [viewing] child pornography in our culture,” Senior Supt. Gilbert Sosa, director of the Philippine National Police’s anticybercrime unit, said last January. “So it is mostly production [of child porn videos that is being done here].” Cybersex dens operate in various parts of the country, with some families coercing their own kin to perform lewd acts for profit. The internet provides anonymity and protection from conventional attempts at enforcing such laws as Republic Act No. 9995 (the Anti-Photo and Video Voyeurism Act of 2009), RA 7610 (the Special Protection of Children Against Child Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act), and RA 9208 (the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2003). The PNP and NBI have been shutting down one such operation after another, only for new ones to spring up. The government’s  push against online child abuse and trafficking cannot but  continue.  Filipino children are increasingly at risk. Last July, the Department of Social Welfare and Development reported that child abuse in the country was on the rise. The number of cases of child abuse reported in the first quarter of 2016 (2,147) was almost half of that reported in the entirety  of 2015 (4,374). Most of the cases involved sexual abuse (539). According to Social Welfare Secretary Judy Taguiwalo, the DSWD would intensify  its efforts to stop child abuse through “information dissemination … and implementation of psychosocial interventions geared toward the recovery, healing and reintegration of victims-survivors.”  “We want to promote a society where the rights of Filipino children are respected and protected. We cannot do this alone without the help of citizens who are concerned for our children’s welfare,” Taguiwalo said in a statement. Indeed. One country cannot go it alone. This  is why the renewed commitment and crucial  collaboration of the Philippines and the United States in battling online sex crimes involving children acquire the utmost urgency. The evil of child abuse and trafficking cannot  be  overemphasized. ;Editorial;['campaign against child abuse and trafficking', 'Child Protection Compact', 'Inquirer editorial', 'Inquirer Opinion', 'US-Philippines relations'];https://opinion.inquirer.net/103208/crucial-agreement;8
71;OVAC;Parents warned vs Net lingo: ‘Let’s try 8’;Philippine Daily Inquirer;TJ Burgonio;Fri, 19 Dec 2014 06:27:03 PST;article;MANILA, Philippines–Beware the language of the Internet, Sen. Loren Legarda warned, saying that certain online terms might actually be a code for cyberpornography and sexual abuse. The senator said the public, especially parents, must beware of the subtle language of the Internet, adding that despite the Net’s myriad advantages as a tool of information and communication, it has also become an avenue for human trafficking.  “Acronyms have become tools for pornography and online sexual abuse,” Legarda said in a privilege speech. She cited the number “8,” which she said might sound harmless, but has a more sinister meaning in Internet lingo.  “The message ‘let’s try 8’ would seem harmless to an unknowing parent … (but) in Internet lingo, the number ‘8’ means ‘oral sex,’” the senator said. Human trafficking  Cybersex has emerged as one of the “many tentacles” of human trafficking, Legarda said, adding that Congress has passed the Expanded Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act in 2013 precisely to address emerging new challenges.  Under the law, harboring a child for purposes of prostitution or production of pornographic materials is considered trafficking, she said. Moreover, the crime is considered qualified trafficking when the offender is the parent, guardian or someone who exercises authority over the child, Legarda added. The senator said the Philippines has shown significant improvements in combating human trafficking, with the 2014 Global Slavery Index ranking the Philippines No. 1 in Asia, No. 3 in Asia-Pacific, and No. 29 worldwide out of 166 countries, in terms of government response against human trafficking. Sense of complacency  “These numbers should not, however, give us a sense of complacency,” Legarda cautioned. “While this is laudable, we cannot celebrate just yet because we know that there are still many Filipino women, children and even men here in the country and in other parts of the world who are hoping and praying that soon they will be rescued from slavery and be able to tread on a new path for a much brighter future,” she said. The senator exhorted the public to mount a massive information and education campaign against all forms of human trafficking, including cyberpornography. “The illegal human trade is a complex web. Battling it requires a concerted effort from all sectors of society. But preventing the crime and protecting our children from trafficking can actually start at home by educating our children on how they can protect themselves (through) the responsible use of the Internet,” Legarda said.;;['cyberpornography', 'Internet', 'Net lingo', 'online terms', 'Parents'];http://technology.inquirer.net/39971/parents-warned-vs-net-lingo-lets-try-8;8

REYES (Second of three parts) CEBU CITY—Online child pornography has become a “cottage industry” in isolated parts of the country, according to authorities.  Parents are lured by the easy money while some children are left believing that there is nothing wrong with what they are doing since there is no actual sexual contact. Data from the International Justice Mission (IJM), a US-based nonprofit that fights human trafficking and child exploitation, showed that more than 300 children in the Philippines have been rescued since 2011 after law enforcers stepped up their campaign against cyberpornography.  At least 133 suspects nationwide have been arrested as of April 2018—77 percent of whom were parents, relatives, and close family friends of the victims. All over Philippines  According to John Tanagho, IJM Cebu field office director, online sexual exploitation of children happens all over the Philippines, especially in poor and isolated areas. But he lamented that law enforcers fighting cyberpornography had been active only in a few places — Pampanga, Metro Manila, Batangas and Cavite in Luzon, Cebu, Negros Occidental, Leyte and Bohol in the Visayas and in the cities of Davao, Butuan and Iligan in Mindanao. “It’s very alarming and it’s getting bigger,” said Francis Señora, senior agent of the cybercrime department of the National Bureau of Investigation in Central Visayas. “Child pornography is an industry, and people are earning money. Children are made to believe there’s nothing wrong with it,” he said. In Cebu, law enforcers have rescued 155 victims and arrested 53 suspects since 2011. Only 11 of the child exploiters have so far been convicted.  Tanagho said the state of online sexual exploitation of children, or child cyberpornography, was disturbing. The cybercrime office of the Department of Justice monthly receives more than 2,600 “cybertips” — referrals of different forms of online sexual exploitation, he said. “It is not just nude photos as some think. Online sexual exploitation of children involves the actual sexual abuse of children,” he added. “Young Filipino children have been molested and sexually abused by adults, forced to have sex with other children, made to use sex toys to portray sex acts, made to touch themselves and other sexually explicit conduct.” Some victims very young IJM records showed that more than 50 percent of the rescued victims in the Philippines were just 12 years old or younger, he said. Some of those rescued were just babies and toddlers, he added. Cyberpornography thrives because some people are easily enticed by easy money without hard work, Tanagho said. Sex predators pay between P1,000 and P5,000 for each sexual act livestreamed, he said. “And because the transactions happen online, the suspects believe they are anonymous on the internet and think police can’t find them. They think they won’t get caught,” he added.

 Instead of using laptops, some customers have shifted to cell phones, thinking it would be difficult for law enforcers to catch them in the act. International cooperation Although technology makes it harder to combat cyberpornography, Tanagho said Philippine authorities continued to cooperate with international law enforcement agencies in cracking down on online child sexual exploitation and abuse. “Effective law enforcement stops criminals and protects children from online sexual exploitation,” he said. Their efforts are bearing fruit as suspected online traffickers are arrested every month. Some suspects were arrested this year in Cordova town, Lapu-Lapu City, Tacloban City and Biliran town. Cordova, a fishing town on Mactan Island, has been described by law enforcers as a hot spot for home-based cyberporn. Last year, police arrested suspects in Bacolod City in Negros Occidental, in the cities of Cebu, Mandaue and Talisay in Cebu and in Bohol and Leyte, among other provinces. Señora said authorities were thankful that local governments were also taking measures to stop cyberpornography. Money remittance reports

 Both Mandaue City and Cordova are taking a step further by requiring money remittance establishments to submit a monthly report on customers and suspicious transactions that may be related to cyberpornography. There is a plan to replicate the local ordinances in all the other towns and cities of Cebu. Señora said there would be no letup in the campaign against online sexual exploitation of children. “Our children are supposed to be our treasure. We will try our best to go after those who exploit our children. We must remember that victims are potential perpetrators [if we do nothing to help them],” he said. Sustained exposure to pornography leads to serious psychological disorders in minors and even adults, said Rosemarie Gonato, a psychologist who specializes in trauma and child abuse. “Constant exposure to pornographic materials will register in the brain. The images are hard to erase, especially when one gets used to them,” Gonato said. “The effect will set in later. That’s why they need long-term intervention,” she said. “How long? That would depend on how a child copes.” Life in prison not enough Gonato said the child victims were made to believe that cyberpornography was “not actual, sexual contact, that it’s not a direct invasion of the body.” The children, she said, think cyberpornography is normal because their parents are involved in it.

 “They believe that whatever their parents teach them is right,” Gonato said. The parents of the children who were rescued from a cybersex operation in Cordova town in 2011 have been languishing in jail for seven years, awaiting the outcome of their trial on charges of child pornography, human trafficking and child abuse. “The cases have been submitted for decision,” said government prosecutor Lolita Lomanta. Judge Ferdinand Rafanan of the 55th branch of the Regional Trial Court in Mandaue City will hand down the decision after three other judges who also heard the cases have retired. While it may be painful for the children, Lomanta said she hoped the parents would be convicted. “Just imagine exploiting your own children. If you think of it, life imprisonment is not enough for them,” she said. “This must serve as a lesson for every parent or any member of a family who takes advantage of children. Up to now, there are a lot of children being exploited by members of their own family. There are just people who have not learned their lesson,” she added.";Headlines;['child pornography', 'child trafficking', 'cyberporn', 'Ferdinand Rafanan', 'Francis Señora', 'Inquirer Special Report', 'International Justice Mission', 'John Tanagho', 'NBI'];https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1008285/the-cat-and-mouse-game-to-stop-cyberporn;8
73;OVAC;50 children saved after police bust paedophile website: Interpol;Agence France-Presse;Agence France-Presse;Thu, 23 May 2019 15:28:47 PST;article;LYON, France — International police group Interpol said Thursday that nine people had been arrested in Thailand, Australia and the US and 50 children had been rescued after investigators took down an online paedophilia ring. More arrests were expected as police in nearly 60 countries pursue investigations stemming from an Interpol operation launched two years ago into a hidden “dark web” site with 63,000 users worldwide.  Fifty children were rescued following the arrests. Police are trying to identify an additional 100 in images that had been shared on the internet’s uncharted corners. Interpol said its Operation Blackwrist began after it found material that was traced back to a subscription-based site on the dark web, where people can use encrypted software to hide behind layers of secrecy.  Dark web sites can’t be found through search engines, and users need to have the specific URL address to land on a site. Interpol enlisted help from national agencies worldwide, with the US Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) department eventually tracking the site’s IP address, where new photos and videos were posted weekly.  The first arrests came in early 2018, when the site’s main administrator, Montri Salangam, was detained in Thailand, and another administrator, Ruecha Tokputza, was captured in Australia. – ‘Child’s worst nightmare’ – Salangam, whose victims included one of his nephews, was sentenced in June last year to 146 years in prison by Thai courts, while an associate, a pre-school teacher, got 36 years. Tokputza was handed a 40-year prison term at his trial in Australia last Friday, the longest ever for child sex offences in the country. The Australian Associated Press reported that Tokputza, 31, pleaded guilty to 50 counts of abuse of 11 babies and children — one just 15 months old — between 2011 and 2018.  “You are a child’s worst nightmare, you are every parent’s horror, you are a menace to the community,” Judge Liesl Chapman said in Adelaide. Interpol did not identify the others arrested. The HSI’s regional attache in Bangkok, Eric McLoughlin, said in the statement that “numerous arrests” had been made in the US. Some held “positions of public trust,” he said, and one individual was abusing his two-year-old stepbrother. “Operation Blackwrist sends a clear message to those abusing children, producing child sexual exploitation material and sharing the images online: We see you, and you will be brought to justice,” Interpol’s Secretary General Juergen Stock said.;World;['Dark Web', 'International news', 'Interpol', 'Operation Blackwrist', 'paedophilia ring'];https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1122539/50-children-saved-after-police-bust-paedophile-website-interpol;8
74;OVAC;Filipino nabbed for child sex exploitation;Philippine Daily Inquirer;Mariejo S. Ramos;Sat, 27 Jul 2019 05:45:59 PST;article;Law enforcement agencies in the Philippines had vowed to combat transnational child sexual exploitation following the arrest of a Filipino man tagged as one of Europe’s most wanted child abuse offenders. The National Bureau of Investigation Anti-Human Trafficking Division (NBI-HTD) chief Janet Fransciso said they were waiting to target other child sexual exploitation offenders through cross-border collaboration between foreign law enforcement groups.  The NBI-HTD had partnered with the Philippine Internet Crimes Against Children Center, the Philippine National Police Women and Children Protection Center (WCPC), the Australian Federal Police and the United Kingdom National Crime Agency in arresting 32-year-old Nelson Torayno in Cebu City in April for filming Filipino children being sexually abused by an adult. 8 children rescued  The Europol said Torayno had been “producing horrendous child exploitation material and posting that in dark web chat rooms where it was circulated amongst pedophile rings.” Francisco said eight children from Cebu province and Iligan City had been rescued from Torayno’s criminal activities as of Thursday and had been returned to their families.  Five children from Cebu City, age 3 to 11, had been given trauma-informed interventions, Francisco said. Brig. Gen. William Macavinta, chief of the PNP-WCPC, said they would continue to pursue child sexual offenders “regardless of the nationality [or location] of the perpetrators.” Torayno will face charges in violation of the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2003. —WITH A REPORT FROM AP ;Headlines;['child abuse offenders', 'child porn', 'National Bureau of Investigation Anti-Human Trafficking Division', 'Nelson Torayno'];https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1146803/pinoy-nabbed-for-child-sex-exploitation;8
75;OVAC;Darkweb: Child Porn Probe Leads to 337 Arrests World wide;AFP;AFP;2019-10-18T16:00:13+00:00;article;"International law enforcement authorities announced Wednesday that a global investigation into child pornography sold for bitcoin on the underground internet had reaped 337 arrests and the shutdown of the dark web’s most notorious pedophile site. Authorities from the United States, Britain, South Korea, and other countries said they had rescued at least 23 minor victims of sexual exploitation who were often video-recorded by abusers who then sold the videos on the now-shuttered “Welcome to Video” site on the darknet.  The website sold the videos to users for bitcoin, which makes it extremely difficult to track the buyer. From June 2015, when “Welcome to Video” started up, to March 2018, the website received at least 420 bitcoin virtual currency — around $370,000 at the time of the payments — in at least 7,300 transactions, the US Justice Department said in an indictment. The server, which had about 250,000 videos, was seized by US, British and South Korean police on March 5, 2018, and the operator, 23-year old Son Jong-Woo was arrested and jailed in Korea. Since then hundreds of users from 12 countries have been tracked down and arrested.
  On Wednesday, US authorities unsealed a US indictment of Son as well as announcing the seizure of virtual currency accounts of 24 people in five countries that had been “used to fund the website and promote the exploitation of children.” The collaboration between global law enforcement agencies was sparked by the British investigation into a British scientist for child sex offenses, according to Britain’s National Crime Agency. Matthew Falder was sentenced to 25 years in jail in 2017 after admitting 137 counts of online abuse, including the encouragement of child rape and even the abuse of a baby. “The website monetized the sexual abuse of children and was one of the first to offer sickening videos for sale using the cryptocurrency bitcoin,” the NCA said in a statement. The NCA said seven men have already been convicted in Britain since the first suspect was arrested in 2017.  One man “was jailed for 22 years for raping a five-year-old boy and appearing on Welcome To Video sexually abusing a three-year-old girl.” In Washington, the US Department of Justice said the site operated “the largest child sexual exploitation market by volume of content” when it was taken down. US authorities have investigated 92 individuals in the case. Many of those arrested have been charged and sentenced. “This was one of the first times that law enforcement saw the use of cryptocurrency in trafficking child pornography,” said US Attorney Jessie Liu. French Police Seize Euthanasia Drugs Bought in the US US Banks Report Mixed Earnings Causing Trader Uncertainty “The site hosted more than a quarter-million videos and users downloaded more than one million files,” she said. Don Fort of the US Internal Revenue Service, which took part in the investigation, said it demonstrated that criminals can be tracked on the darknet and cannot conceal their identities behind cryptocurrency accounts. “You went on the dark web, thinking that your actions were anonymous, but they weren’t, and we found you,” he told a press conference in Washington.  “Our agents have once again proved that there’s nowhere that you can hide.” ";No news category;['Darkweb', 'technology'];https://usa.inquirer.net/43313/darkweb-child-porn-probe-leads-to-337-arrests;8
76;OVAC;PH to regulate porn sites to curb child abuse;INQUIRER.net;Tetch Torres-Tupas;Wed, 29 Oct 2014 17:47:20 PST;article;MANILA, Philippines—The Department of Justice (DOJ) is working to regulate porn sites in the Philippines to protect children from sexual predators. “We are coming up with a filtering software,” Justice Assistant Secretary Geronimo Sy, head of the Department of Justice’s Office of Cybercrime said Wednesday. “It has to be something that is automated, an available algorithm that if it shows certain banned sites worldwide, that side should not be accessed.”  “It will show certain banned websites at least from the Interpol (International Police), Europol (European Police) that we put together,” he said. INQUIRER FILE PHOTO Sy said the cybercrime office has asked the help of telecommunication companies to install an at-source filter that will block sites with sexual abuse content.  However, he said none of the telecommunication firms are cooperating with the DOJ. “If they still continue to hedge and not do it, because every day crimes are committed, we’ll have to take stronger action and make sure it happens at least within the next six to 12 months,” Sy said.  Justice Secretary Leila De Lima said there have been an estimated 200 cases of online child abuse in the Philippines yearly since 2013 based on records of the Philippine National Police and the National Bureau of Investigation cybercrime units.  Worldwide, estimates by the European Commission in 2005 showed that one million child sexual abuse images are uploaded every year online with 70 percent of victims below the age of 10. “These images can be copied…potentially ad infinitum (endless) so that the children they portray can be effectively re-victimized forever, over and over again,” De Lima said during the public-private sector roundtable dialogue on child sexual abuse online. De Lima said all sectors should cooperate to stop this problem. “The problem of online child sexual abuse demands cooperation among all relevant stakeholders, and it cannot and must not be solved by government alone,” she said. “It cannot be solved by government alone because of the multivalent nature of this crime, which is carried out through internet service providers and transacted using financial institutions, and which needs to be combated with effective information campaigns in schools, churches, and media.” ;;['Child Abuse', 'Children', 'Department of Justice', 'DOJ', 'pornography', 'Website'];https://technology.inquirer.net/39220/ph-to-regulate-porn-sites-to-curb-child-abuse;8
77;OVAC;Real dangers online;Philippine Daily Inquirer;Christopher Ryan B. Maboloc and Jeresa May C. Ochave;Sat, 07 Jun 2014 02:41:44 PST;article;In a report for Spiegel Online International, “Curse of Cybersex: The Lost Children of Cebu,” Katrin Kuntz narrates how the municipality of Cordova in Cebu has become a den for cybersex. Parents “force their children to strip in front of the webcam,” arguing in a depraved manner that the young bodies are not touched anyway. Sexual exploitation is said to have become some sort of a cottage industry in the municipality. Parents still use the same lame excuse: It is a way of escaping the claws of poverty. The situation in Cordova manifests how technology is being used in order to dehumanize the human child. While children are protected by human rights, the ineptness of some government officials and the lack of resources of concerned agencies result in the destruction of the dignity of thousands of young children peddled online on a daily basis.  Thomas Friedman warned us of such an evil as early as 2005, when he noted quite rightly in “The World is Flat” that “there is plenty to worry about in this future, from kids being lured by online sexual predators through their cell phones to employees spending too much time playing mindless phone games, to people using their phone cameras for all sorts of illicit activities.” In itself, the Internet is not evil. It is the information that one puts online and how that information is used that determine its value and purpose. Technology becomes nothing but a tool that propagates what is good and bad. Generally, social media can be a means to promote critical thinking, the common good and pluralist values. But without strong law enforcement, some unscrupulous businessmen can easily take advantage of people’s dire circumstances. Furthermore, the lack of regulation, protocol and clear moral norms online make the Internet fertile ground for the malice and ill-intent of cabals and other criminal elements that prey on the innocent.  Replacements Another important concern is that our attachment to the online world has deteriorated into some type of a robotic relationship. Our online devices have replaced many things in our lives. They control everything in us. While we use gadgets and computers according to our specifications and compatibility requirements because these are tools designed to perform particular functions, the undeniable reality is that we have become overly dependent on them. Millions of students who are in search of attention tend to reveal too much of themselves on the Internet, without understanding that they are making themselves potential victims of abuse and bullying. Cyberbullying has resulted in various incidents of suicide.  In the 2014 movie “Her,” the lead character Theodore, a divorcee, claims to have fallen in love with “Samantha,” a computer operating system. Theodore argues that it is a new kind of relationship because falling for this hyperintelligent “being” means that the relationship is beyond space and time. “Samantha” does not have a physical body, so she can be everywhere and anywhere. She has feelings—or unsettling feelings, Theodore would like to say.  Michio Kaku’s 1997 book “Visions” elaborates on the possibility of man engaging in cyborg relationships. Kaku writes that “artificial intelligence envisions providing a robot with the capacity to ‘love’ its master, which would increase its commercial success and acceptability by the owner… When you bring one into your house, it will understand that you’re the person it’s there for, and that it had better keep you happy… It will care how you feel about its actions. It will try to please you in an apparently selfless manner because it will get a thrill out of this positive reinforcement. You can interpret this as a kind of love.” Against this case, it can be argued that the longing to be with someone is not only psychological but also physical. Interhuman relationships require that somehow you need to meet the individual and ask her questions, see her smile, talk to her about anything including the nonsensical, or look into her sweet eyes. Also, it is human nature to miss someone who is dear to us. This longing is reflective of what matters to us as human beings. For instance, our overseas Filipino workers ease their loneliness by means of online technology. Self-disclosure  Our technology has allowed conversation with a complete stranger possible by means of electronic mail, chat rooms or text messaging. But at the outset, it can be said that this modern convention is less satisfying when compared to that with a real or authentic acquaintance. The “social penetration theory” by Irwin Altman and Dalmas Taylor explains that interpersonal relationships evolve in a gradual and predictable fashion. This theory asserts that self-disclosure is the primary way that superficial encounters progress into intimate relationships. Intimacy, in effect, makes one vulnerable, for the individual begins to reveal the deeper part of her. So can people really develop authentic human relationships online? While the dangers may be apparent, human commitment takes its roots from different angles. A simple gesture can sow the seed of a serious relationship that lasts a lifetime. Thus, it is wrong to say that everything that happens online is bereft of substance. It does not make you less of a human person when you use some chat room or when you use the online messenger service. Beyond the need to cure boredom, expressing human feelings using the channel of this modern-day means of communication is quite an experience that is worth considering. But more children are hooked on computer games and prefer being online than spending time with family. They have become modern-day zombies who know nothing about the real world. While these ultra-modern online tools are important for us to be connected to people, there is a great danger in terms of people being controlled by technology. Thus, this modern-day love affair poses potential risks to the values we hold dear. Christopher Ryan B. Maboloc is a faculty member at Ateneo de Davao University. Jeresa May C.

78;OVAC;11 arrested over online child porn;Agence France-Presse;Agence France-Presse;Wed, 29 Jan 2014 17:15:52 PST;article;"INQUIRER FILE PHOTO MANILA, Philippines — Authorities said Wednesday they had detained 11 people in raids on two fake call center businesses that sold child pornography online to global clients. The raids came after police said this month the Philippines had become a major source of pornographic content in the fast-growing child cybersex industry, and vowed to crack down on those involved.  The raids took place overnight Tuesday on two Manila businesses that used nude pictures of children, as well as adults, to entice people online to subscribe to pornographic websites, the National Bureau of Investigation said. “They were caught in flagrante (in the act of wrongdoing),” Ronald Aguto, head of the bureau’s cybercrime unit, told AFP, in reference to the 11 Filipinos who had been detained.  “Some of the computers contained child pornography as well as adult pornography.” Some of the nude photographs on the computers were of unidentified Filipino children aged about 12-16, according to Aguto.  He said the suspects faced potential child pornography and human trafficking charges against the suspects, although authorities still needed to investigate the case further.  Aguto said the business model involved staff chatting online with people overseas, showing them pornographic photos, in a bid to lure them into buying website subscriptions. The businesses received a commission of $5 for each subscription, and together cleared more than $8,000 a day, according to Aguto. The government pledge to crack down on child cybersex operations came after British and Australian police announced this month they had dismantled a pedophile ring that streamed live sexual abuse of Filipino children over the Internet. Philippine police subsequently said the country was one of the world’s biggest sources of live streaming of child sex abuse, with children performing acts in front of webcams to online pedophiles in an industry worth billions of dollars.  Poverty and the promise of easy money had seen some Filipino parents allowing their children to be abused online for the paying audience, they added. Aguto said Wednesday authorities had not found evidence of video streaming on the computers seized in the Manila raids. RELATED STORIES Filipinos rank 15th in global porn watching

79;OVAC;US arrests include Philippine felons;Cebu Daily News;Cebu Daily News;Fri, 05 Aug 2011 07:33:41 PST;article;"United States officials said they uncovered an international child pornography network and arrested 72 people who used an online bulletin board called Dreamboard to trade tens of thousands of images and videos of sexually abused children. The Philippines was one of the countries where arrests were made, according to the Associated Press report.  Attorney General Eric Holder and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano yesterday said  a 20-month law enforcement effort called Operation Delego targeted more than 600 Dreamboard members around the world for allegedly participating in the private, members-only Internet club created to promote pedophilia. Many participants in the network sexually abused children aged 12 and under produced images and video of the abuse and then shared it with other club members, according to court papers released in the case.  (No details about the Philippine arrests were stated in the AP report but cybersex crimes involving children have gotten high news attention since the June 1 raid of a low-income family in Cordova town, north Cebu. The parents were arrested in the act of directing their young children in a live sex show before a web camera. (Prior to the raid, US Homeland Security agents assisted the National  Bureau of Investigation [NBI] in Cebu  monitor the online activities of the Cordova parents, who used several Internet accounts to reach  paying clients abroad.  (The husband and wife, both unemployed, are on trial on non-bailable charges of human trafficking, child abuse and child pornography before the Regional Trial Court in Lapu-Lapu City.) Of the 72 charged in the United States, 43 have been arrested in the US  and nine abroad. Another 20 are known to authorities only by their Internet names and remain at large. Authorities have arrested people in 13 other countries, including the Philippines. The other countries were Canada, Denmark, Ecuador, France, Germany, Hungary, Kenya, the Netherlands, Qatar, Serbia, Sweden and Switzerland, but some of those were arrested on local rather than the U.S. charges. NIGHTMARE  At a news conference, the attorney general called the criminal activity a “nightmare” for the children and said that some of the children featured in the images and videos were just infants. In many cases, the children being victimized were in obvious, and intentional, pain—even in distress and crying, just as the rules for one area of the bulletin board mandated, the attorney general said. Napolitano said the amount of child porn swapped by participants in the network was massive, the equivalent to 16,000 DVDs. The U.S. indictments were unsealed in Shreveport, Louisiana. To conceal their conduct, members used screen names rather than actual names and accessed the bulletin board via proxy servers, with Internet traffic routed through other computers to disguise a user’s location, according to the court papers. Participants were required to continually upload images of child sexual abuse to maintain their membership. Participants who molested children and created new images of child pornography were placed in a “Super VIP” category that gave them access to the entire quantity of child porn on the bulletin board, the court papers stated. A “Super Hardcore” section of the bulletin board was limited to posts showing adults having violent sexual intercourse with “very young kids” subjected to physical and sexual abuse. All 72 U.S. defendants are charged with conspiring to advertise and distribute child pornography, and 50 of them are also charged with engaging in a child pornography enterprise. Thirteen of the 52 defendants who have been arrested have pleaded guilty in the conspiracy. Of the four who have been sentenced, the least amount of prison time was 20 years behind bars and the most was 30 years.  AP

103;OVAC;The cat-and-mouse game;No news platform;No Author;Wed, 30 May 2018 22:53:39 PST;No news type;"Social workers escort one of the children rescued in another cybersex enterprise in Cordova town, Cebu on July 12, 2011, a month after the first raid of a family home. CYBERPORNOGRAPHY (PART 3) Like the menace of illegal drugs, cyber pornography has been prevalent in the Philippines and poses serious threats to families and children. “It’s very alarming and it’s getting larger at the threshold,” said Francis Señora, senior agent of the National Bureau of Investigation in Central Visayas (NBI-7) Cybercrime Department.  Fueled by lust and the desire for “easy money,” people engage in cyber pornography, which in a number of instances, has become a family business.
Children are pushed by their own parents into cyberpornography by making them believe that this was a normal job. The fact that not all cases involve actual sexual contact or direct intrusion of the body also makes the young victims think that such was okay. “Child pornography is an industry, and people are earning money. Children are made to believe that there’s nothing wrong with it,” Señora said. Data obtained from the International Justice Mission (IJM), a non-governmental organization actively fighting all forms of human trafficking and child exploitation, reveal that over 300 victims of online sexual exploitation of children had been rescued throughout the Philippines since government stepped up its campaign against cyber pornography. As of April 2018, at least 133 suspects were arrested — 77 percent of whom were parents, relatives, and close family friends of the victims. In Cebu, law enforcement units have rescued 155 victims, and arrested 53 cyber porn suspects since 2011. Of the number, only 11 persons had been convicted. Disturbing Lawyer John Tanagho, IJM Cebu field office director, said the state of online sexual exploitation of children (OSEC), otherwise known as cyber pornography, is very disturbing. He said that on average, the Department of Justice’s Cybercrime Office receives over 2,600 “cybertip” referrals of different forms of online sexual exploitation each month. “It is not just nude photos as some think. Online sexual exploitation of children involves the actual sexual abuse of children. Young Filipino children have been molested and sexually abused by adults, forced to have sex with other children, made to use sex toys to portray sex acts, made to touch themselves, and other sexually explicit conduct,” Tanagho told Cebu Daily News. And the victims, he added, were very young. Based on their records, over 50% of the rescued victims in the Philippines were just 12 years old or younger. Some, he said, were even babies and toddlers. Easy money Cyber pornography thrives, Tanagho explained, because of people who are easily enticed by money without having to work hard. He said sex predators usually pay between P1,000 to P5,000 for every “livestream” of the sexual act. “Because the transactions happen online, the suspects believe they are anonymous on the internet and think police can’t find them. They think they won’t get caught,” Tanagho said. Instead of using laptop computers, several people who are into cyber pornography have shifted to using cellular phones to make it more difficult for law enforcers to track them down while shooting the live lewd acts. Though technology makes it harder for authorities to combat cyber pornography, Tanagho said they continue to collaborate with international law
enforcement agencies in the investigation of cases involving online sexual exploitation and abuse of children throughout the Philippines. “Effective law enforcement stops criminals and protects children from online sexual exploitation,” he said. Their efforts are bearing fruit as more and more suspected online traffickers have been arrested each month. This year, arrests were made in Cordova town, Lapu-Lapu City, Tacloban City, and Biliran town for alleged online trafficking. Cordova, a 3rd class municipality on Mactan island, has been identified by law enforcers as a “hotspot” for home-based cyberporn. Last year, police also arrested suspected online traffickers in other places of the Visayas such as Bacolod, Bohol, Leyte, and the cities of Cebu, Mandaue, and Talisay in Cebu. Obstacles Señora said some existing policies, prevent law enforcement agencies from going full blast in investigating the online sexual exploitation of children. For one, he said it remains difficult to trace cellular phone numbers and Internet Protocol (IP) addresses due to the lack of regulations mandating the specific registration of owners. “In other countries, you have to give your passport or whatever identification before you get a SIM card. But here in the Philippines, you just can buy SIM cards for P20 to P50,” said Señora. But despite the obstacles, Señora assured the NBI and police authorities are doing their best to fight online sexual exploitation of children. “We try to get human information from locals and coordinate with foreign counterparts for intelligence reports,” he said. Solutions Señora is grateful that local government units are taking steps to stop cyber pornography. Both the Mandaue City government and Cordova town are implementing an ordinance requiring businesses engaged in money remittances to submit a monthly report on customers and suspicious transactions which may be related to cyberpornography. There are plans to replicate the scheme in the entire province of Cebu, as officials believe that money transfer establishments are being used as conduit by criminals engaged in human trafficking and sexual exploitation. “Our children are supposed to be our treasure. We will try our best to go after those who exploit our children. We must remember that victims can be potential perpetrators if nothing is done to help them,” he said. Porn effects Rosemarie Gonato, a psychologist specializing in trauma and child abuse, said sustained exposure to pornography leads to serious psychological disorders in minors and even adults. “Constant exposure to pornographic materials will register in the brain. The images are hard to erase especially when one gets used to them. The effect will set-in later. That’s why they need long-term intervention. How long? That would depend on how a child copes,” she told CDN. Gonato, who testified in a trial of as an expert witness for the prosecution, said that she was happy that the kids who were rescued from their parents in the first major cyber pornography operation in Cebu in 2011 have recuperated. “They responded to the treatment. The new environment and the support from people help,” she said. (To be continued) WHAT’S UP!

104;OVAC;Churches join hands against human trafficking;Philippine Daily Inquirer;Jimarie Snap Mabanta;Fri, 18 Dec 2015 01:06:28 PST;article;"DEC. 12 marked 15 years of international action against human trafficking. The UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children was adopted on Dec. 12, 2000.  The Philippines has since enacted laws that specifically target human trafficking. The Iacat (Inter-Agency Council Against Trafficking) under the Department of Justice has been created, our police have been trained in dealing with trafficking cases, and community organizations and churches have responded by establishing places of refuge and support for victims. Bishop Broderick Pabillo of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) says “so much more needs to be done, and both churches and government need to continue to increase efforts in bringing an end to this evil.” There is concern that government efforts against human trafficking, especially its support for Iacat, have diminished. Many forms of trafficking in persons, such as labor trafficking inside and outside the country, have hardly begun to be addressed. Meanwhile, the modus operandi of those involved in trafficking is changing and evolving and the authorities struggle to cope with the changes. Fr. Rex Reyes of the National Council of Churches in the Philippines (NCCP) says that many of our migrant workers who become victims of trafficking are either lured (in the Philippines) by unscrupulous recruiters into situations of exploitation or once in another country, find themselves in situations where they become undocumented migrants, subject to the predatory activity of human traffickers.  Human trafficking takes many different forms: recruitment; prostitution; child labor; people lured overseas where they are deceived into selling their organs; seamen deceived into working in illegal and unregistered fishing boats, deprived of wages and often abandoned on foreign shores, among others. Evelyn Pingul of the International Justice Mission (IJM) says, “[O]ne very disturbing trend is the online sexual exploitation of children, where children as young as five or even two years old have been used by close relatives, family friends or even parents to perform sex acts on live Internet streaming for customers in other countries. While the victims may not be physically taken anywhere, they are virtually trafficked, and this clearly qualifies as human trafficking.”  Pingul notes that in the 21 cases of online sexual exploitation in the Philippines, where IJM intervened, 102 victims were rescued. Of these 102 victims, 87 percent were minors, 56 percent of whom 12 years or younger; and 87 percent female. Also, in 41 percent of the cases, the rescued victims were siblings.  Father Reyes says: “As churches we need to make a clear stand against human trafficking, it is the ultimate denial of the dignity conferred on every human being… created in the image of God. To reduce another person to slavery is a blasphemy against the living God.” Bishop Noel Pantoja of the Philippine Council of Evangelical Churches (PCEC) says that, “Human trafficking is an absolute evil. It is the work of the prince of lies, because those who engage in human trafficking betray the trust of others, by deception or playing on the poverty and hardship of others, to rob them of their freedom and reduce them to servitude. The Gospel of Jesus Christ calls us to proclaim freedom for the captive, and release for the prisoner. As Christians we must make a stand in the fight against human trafficking, and support those who have become its victims.” The CBCP, NCCP, PCEC, together with IJM, join the fight against human trafficking through the Philippine Interfaith Movement Against Human Trafficking. This coalition of the major churches of the Philippines demonstrates how the fight against the moral and social evil of human trafficking transcends any confessional boundaries and calls every Christian to make a stand. Jimarie Snap Mabanta is the media liaison of Philippine Interfaith Movement Against Human Trafficking.

106;OVAC;Real men break down the dangerous ‘Pastor’ culture;INQUIRER.net;Niña V. Guno;Thu, 06 Jul 2017 17:09:39 PST;article;"Image: INQUIRER.net stock photo The proliferation of so-called “Bible Study” and “Pastor” Facebook groups brought me back to instances in high school which shaped the way I viewed how boys thought of women. There was not much of social media back then, but I would hear of boys from exclusive schools showing friends sex videos or nude pictures on their phones (we only had flip phones back then), and boys who would have sleepovers to masturbate to porn.  I recognized these Facebook groups as an extension of these acts that I initially thought was normal, but would later on discover as unhealthy behavior that attacked women’s dignity. When I started reporting these groups, I saw in their membership men I knew from college, from a non-profit, and from my childhood. A friend even saw a high school teacher. It is incredibly disappointing and disheartening for women to see that people they thought would be better-educated, whom they trusted, view women as objects of sex.  This time, I wanted to understand the way men thought, by talking to the men themselves. Is violating women’s privacy for sexual pleasure a case of “boys will be boys”? A handful of men from various backgrounds share their thoughts. “It’s normal to like porn”  “It’s normal behavior for guys to enjoy the occasional porn and even partake in some guy banter, but these groups are taking it too far,” says Jack*, 22, an account manager at an advertising agency. “I think men are quite primal when it comes to their thought process,” shares banker Aldrin Dayauon, 24. “If not educated properly as well as guided by proper institutions of society, [they] will always revert back to their basic instincts.” “I think it’s human instinct to think of sex and other dirty thoughts, but anything beyond that I’m not sure it’s basic instinct,” says Mark Canteras, 27, a marketing executive at a major hotel chain. Posting photos without consent and disrespecting women “crosses the line” When news broke that Facebook groups shared photos of women without consent, among the men surveyed, disgust and anger were the general reactions.  “A friend added me to one ‘hokage’ group as a joke and when I looked through it, there was child porn on it so I reported it,” says Anthony*, a law student. “It’s f*cked up.” “It’s sick, but this is actually a representation of man’s subconscious. This is a window into the minds of men, of society-at-large,” shares Mick Banzon, 26, an editor at a tech company. “I won’t even say ‘not all men’ because all men have these thoughts at one point or another. Most will suppress them, have some self control,” Banzon added. “These men just decided to materialize their wants, share it with others and build communities around them.” “To create a whole group dedicated to sharing lewd content of women of all ages, making disparaging comments and actively celebrating it is crossing the line,” says Jack*. “I hate [these groups],” says Michael, 25, who works in a tech company. “It makes me angry of how ‘normal’ and ‘accepted’ it has become to objectify and disrespect girls, who are somebody’s daughter, sister, or mom, not to mention a fellow human being.” “It’s a brotherhood of perverts,” says Mark. Educator Miggy Zaballero, 30, was alarmed to see his own students in the groups. “It’s dangerous because kids are involved and not only are they subject to sexual abuse by adult predators but they are also being exposed to a culture that should be stopped and not encouraged.” “There’s no excuse for that kind of behavior,” he adds. Men do it for ‘harmless fun,’ to ‘boost machismo’ So if some men know it’s wrong, why does degradation of women happen on a wide scale, with some Facebook groups reaching a million members?

 Men may think it’s “harmless fun,” says Jack*. “It makes them feel ‘cool’ to be part of a community and gives them [a] sense of belonging.” “It eventually becomes sort of like a power play,” says Stephen*, a manager at a ride-sharing company. Since the content in these groups are “soft core”, it also seems less offensive than actual porn, explains Mick. “There’s also the belief that this hurts no one physically and so it’s alright.” “I think it boosts the machismo of men when they were the ones who ‘spread the good news,’ hence naming themselves as pastors,” shares Lawrence Malasa, 22, an administrative officer at a government agency. Filipino machismo culture pressures men to act ‘macho’ at the expense of women But “having fun” and increasing their social status comes at the expense of women’s dignity, with women reporting that they have been harassed after their photos were shared. “Guys do it because they need to feel power over these women,” explains Miggy. “Posting pictures without permission or as revenge shows dominance over them.” “The principles behind this mentality are reflected and embedded in the very structures that make up our society,” he adds, citing that the Church, family unit and the government, including President Duterte—who is known to catcall women and have said that adultery is normal—propagate this culture. In the Philippines, “it’s ‘cool’ and ‘macho’ to catcall a woman or make sexual advances even when it is inappropriate to do so,” relates Joms Robles, 25, an account manager at an ad agency. “Movies, TV shows and even our own president endorse the maltreatment and disrespect of women,” says Michael.

 This toxic culture starts from childhood. “Imagine a child who grows up surrounded by men who catcall women, beat women up, brag about their sexual conquests,” relates Miggy. “Imagine them hearing teachers say that boys should do this and girls should do that, and going to church where women are called to ‘serve’ men and to never say no in marriage. Imagine how ingrained that mentality is for them and how incredibly hard it is to break that.” This is exactly what John*, who works in an HR consulting firm, went through at a young age. “Every time we gathered [for family reunions], my uncles would often ask if I find female celebrities attractive whenever they pop up on screen. I was young, probably around seven and really had no sense of attraction and would honestly say ‘no.'” “It’d be clear that they would be disappointed and ask: bakit? (Why?) As if every guy should find any kind of girl to be attractive. I, of course, craving for my family’s approval would then learn and say ‘yes’ the next time they asked,” he shared. He eventually would come to terms to the realization that his lack of attraction was because he was gay. “There was a time that I still played along to their lewd jokes and expectations because I was even more afraid to not fit in.” But he soon saw that this behavior wasn’t a laughing matter. “It was only when I started having female friends that I really stopped playing along.” Repressed sexuality makes dehumanizing women acceptable While boys are raised to assert their “masculinity” through sexual conquests, this conflicts with Catholic teachings that sex is immoral if done for pleasure. “Because of the repressive nature of Philippine society, [men in the Facebook groups] find it refreshing and safe to be parts of these groups that cater to the male libido, even if initially they may not be interested in some of the posts on the group,” says Chris*, 23, a writer at an ad agency. John* adds that viewing women only as objects of affection limits how men view women.

 “They aren’t able to feel respect or see the impact of their actions because straight guys don’t usually hang out with girls,” he says, citing that men are raised to believe that spending time with women without romantic or sexual motives are viewed as less manly. The Internet is the main source of sex education for boys and girls—usually for worse Because sex is never discussed at home or in school, boys and girls turn to the Internet for their sex education. “The concept of sex, of relationships with women, and the pursuit of these were so alien,” says Raph of his teenage years. Like other boys, he learned about his sexuality through pornography. “I used to tell myself ‘I’m not hurting anybody, since I’m just looking.’” “But then, I learned that often there’s no consent. There’s active dehumanization involved. And that dimension is something not all men are taught to be mindful of,” he explains. Unfortunately, while pornography is easily accessible online, being taught to respect women is not. “The missing piece in the puzzle is how guys learn to interact with people—how to have empathy, to understand not just that it’s wrong but why submitting naked pictures of women near you is wrong for public ‘use,’” relates Raph. And while social media has allowed people to express themselves even more, it also poses dangers when users are not educated on ethical behavior. “People can easily stalk and save pictures of other people na pinagnanasaan nila (whom they desire) or objects of sexual interest,” says Lawrence. “I’m not saying na kasalanan nung nag-upload ng picture kung bakit napagpipiyestahan siya ngayon (I’m not saying it’s the fault of the woman who uploaded the photo why she’s being feasted upon.). It’s just that we do not have enough safeguards to protect what we post.”

 Internet anonymity holds no repercussions for deviant behavior “Hidden under the cloak of anonymity, men are emboldened to do as they please without much fear of repercussions on their actions,” says Jack*. “With the ease of anonymity online, it’s really easy to get into even in the most far-flung of provinces where machismo and a man’s sexual drive go unquestioned,” explains Mick. While the toxic patriarchal culture has long been in the Philippines, it has now become more public, thanks to the Internet. “It’s just a matter of time before what is deemed acceptable in the virtual space gradually becomes normalized in real life,” adds Jack*. “There are no consequences at the moment for this kind of deviancy, which helps make it easy to get into,” says Mick. Addressing the ‘pastor’ culture requires multi-pronged solutions “To break the culture will be very hard. But it starts with reporting and not being afraid to call them out for such behavior,” says Miggy. It must be noted that these groups are now trying to hide through other names, including “Spotify” to seem inconspicuous. The lack of legal repercussions also contributes to men’s fearlessness in creating more groups after they get shut down, and for continuing this behavior. Miggy says, “[We need to] strengthen laws and systems and [have] tighter social media measures,” and cites the anti-harassment law in Quezon City and the anti-child pornography laws as starting points.

 Mick suggests, “We need the NBI to make this a priority as well, dedicating resources to solving it like other sexual offenses rather than thinking it’s just a boy’s club.” The NBI has also stated in news reports that victims should come forward for assistance, and that violators could be slapped with penalties for cybercrime, child pornography and voyeurism. Men engaging in these groups may also be sex addicts, in which case it also becomes a mental health issue. If they use sex only to satisfy “their own ends, these men may have some addiction problem,” says Max*. In which case, “teens should be forced into rehabilitation to shake them awake,” says Mick. Men also called for sex education, something that has been elusive to Filipinos because of conservatives and strong Catholic opposition despite the passage of the RH Law. “It’s time to educate both boys and girls regarding these issues in school,” says Joms. “Teach them to respect all genders, uphold values to love and appreciate all people, and to show them that everyone has the right to be respected.“ Miggy declares education should come to “kids as early as possible. [To] adults, as often as possible.” “In the long run, it would be better if our schools and the Filipino society would stop the need to censor discussions about sex as it represses the curiosity and inclination that people naturally have,” says Chris*. Families also need to do their part in opening the discussions on topics that are considered taboo, including sex and appropriate attitudes and behavior with regard to it.

 “Personally, I’d start with my younger brother and talk to him, educating him on why this is unacceptable behavior,” says Jack*. Chris* says discussions with family members could be eye-opening to men. “The approach should not be public humiliation of these people, but rather direct conversations…with their mothers, wives or sisters. A familial connection is more likely to bring the point home with these guys.” Mick believes feminism should start at home. “Family units should make sure to let their boys know that this is wrong, building them up with feminist principles.” “We need to teach [children] how damaging our overly patriarchal society can be in a world that should be more equal and caring and positive,” says Joms.

107;OVAC;Internet user charged with child abuse, grave threats;Cebu Daily News;Cebu Daily News;Sat, 10 Mar 2012 08:12:13 PST;article;CHARGES of child abuse and grave threats were filed against the 24-year-old man accused of blackmailing a 16-year-old Filipino-Japanese girl by  posting her seminude photos online. Bail of P104,000 was recommended for John Jayson Antonio.  Antonio was escorted by National Bureau of Investigation in Central Visayas (NBI-7) agents when he was presented before the Regional Trial Court in Cebu City. Assistant City Prosecutor Mario Ley Gidayawan said there was no basis to file a  charge of robbery-extortion.  “Child abuse includes any act by deeds or words which debases and degrades the intrinsic worth and dignity of a child as a human being. The act of blackmail gravely threatened the normal development of the complainant, a young and helpless girl,” Gidayawan said. When sought for comment, Antonio covered his face with a white towel and declined to say anything.  But he admitted to the NBI-7 agents that he made up stories to extort money and demand sexual favors from the victim. Antonio, a resident of barangay Guadalupe in Cebu City, was arrested by NBI 7 agents in an entrapment operation inside a mall last Tuesday afternoon. A 16-year-old student sought the assistance of the NBI-7 after Antonio  allegedly demanded that she pay him P15,000 so her  photos won’t be uploaded on the Internet. The prosecutor said the act of threatening the victim was a form of child abuse. /Ador Vincent S.

109;OVAC;Initiatives to stop cyberporn studied;No news platform;No Author;Fri, 01 Jun 2018 23:07:22 PST;No news type;"THE PROVINCIAL Women’s Commission (PWC) together with local executives, the International Justice Mission (IJM) and the police, are pooling their resources and sharing initiatives to end online sexual exploitation of children (OSEC) in Cebu. They all agreed that the cooperation of the community is key towards protecting children from cyber pornography and sexual exploitation. “It takes a village to raise a child. First in schools, the teachers are in charge. In homes it should be the parents, while outside of their homes and schools, the LGU will be responsible for the child,” San Fernando town Mayor Lakambini Reluya said Among the initiatives of the municipality to require residents to register their internet connection with their respective barangays, strengthening the purok system and giving rewards to people who report persons engaged in OSEC.  Roland Lastimosa, who represented Talisay City said a task force for the protection of children was created through an ordinance, “ to look after our children and likewise apprehend those scrupulous perpetrators.” Money Remittances Cordova Mayor Therese Sitoy Cho said they have an existing ordinance that monitors suspicious transactions through money remittance outlets. But neighboring LGUs do not have a similar ordinance so that those who sell lewd photos of children go to other areas to receive payments.
Cho said a nude photo sells for at least P10 thousand. She stressed the need for a national law that would prevent OSEC perpetrators from receiving money from their “sponsors” through money transfer outlets. “We really need a national law to be more aggressive,” she said. Mandaue City Vice Mayor Carlo Fortuna said that he would like the province to adopt the city’s ordinance which establishes a protocol governing the conduct of law enforcement agencies and money remittance centers in the investigation of online sexual exploitation of persons and cyber-pornography cases. IJM Director, lawyer John Tangho said online sexual abuse of children is live-streamed online to pedophiles and online predators around the world in exchange for money usually that comes through money transferring agencies. According to IJM’s data from 2011 to 2018, there were 99 victims rescued in Cebu, 54 of them were 12 years old and below, 32 were minors above 12 and 13 were adults. Ninety three percent were female while seven percent were male. Tangho said one survivor that the IJM rescued was a seventeen year old girl who was now in college working on her social work degree and she’s beaming with confidence and empowerment. Cases Cebu City topped the cities with the highest number of cases filed in court against human traffickers in Cebu province, followed by Lapu-Lapu City and Mandaue City. Regional State Prosecutor Fernando Gubalane said 181 cases were already filed from 2003 until 2017. The development caused both positive and negative reactions. “Makaingon ta nga nalipay ta kay maka-attribute ta sa mga (We can say that this is a good development because we helped in the) rescue operations. But , on the other side, it shows that indeed there is such a big number of trafficking cases or incidents,” Gubalane, who also sits as chief of the Inter-Agency Council Against Trafficking in Central Visayas (IACAT-7), said. Cebu Vice Governor Agnes Magpale, who heads the PWC said the success of the campaign against OSEC has benefited many victims. One of the earliest victims who underwent rehabilitation and counseling is now working on an International Cruise Ship and plans to build a home for his family. /CNU Intern, Bea Samantha Esteves";No news category;No Tags;https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/177893/initiatives-stop-cyberporn-studied;12
110;OVAC;VIP in prison;No news platform;No Author;Sat, 28 Jan 2017 23:46:20 PST;No news type;"PETER Gerard Scully is being brought to the Lumbia City Jail in Cagayan de Oro where he would be detained while facing charges of child abuse and trafficking in this photo taken on Feb. 20, 2015 Even behind bars, Peter Gerard Scully, the notorious alleged sex predator who brutally sodomized children in Mindanao,   continues to communicate with the outside world. And if that was not enough, Scully is now believed to be operating his nefarious child trafficking business from inside the Lumbia City Jail in Cagayan de Oro, some 15 kilometers away from the city proper, where he continues to insist on getting  “special treatment.”   The Australian, believed to have mercilessly tortured children for the benefit of his pedophile clients across the globe in a series of online videos sold for $10,000 per view,  also communicated regularly with his girlfriend, Liezyl Margallo,  from the confines of his jail cell. The 23-year-old woman was on the lam to evade authorities who believed that she helped Scully run his gruesome international cyberpornography trade by luring would-be victims, all street children and young scavengers, with a promise of food, education and a roof over their heads.    But Scully and Margallo’s relationship did not end with the suspected pedophile’s arrest. Scully, even while in jail,  is also said to have financed Margallo’s luxurious lifestyle in Cebu, where she lived for more than a year before her arrest last Wednesday.  Phone calls A number of phone calls and text messages between Scully and Margallo were discovered by the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) even after the Australian national was arrested in Malaybalay, Bukidnon, in February 2015. “They definitely continued to communicate with each other. And we fear that Scully is still on top of his online (pay-per-view) services (showing the sexual torture of children),” NBI-7 Director Dominador Cimafranca told Cebu Daily News yesterday. Margallo’s cell phone was confiscated by NBI agents when they finally caught up with the fugitive on Malapascua Island in the northern part of Cebu.
Pending follow-up operations, its contents remain confidential. Margallo’s cell phone and laptop will be subjected to forensic examination by the NBI. Cimafranca said the NBI is on a quandary as to how Scully managed to contact Margallo when inmates are supposedly prohibited from possessing cell phones inside the jail. Early on, jail officers reportedly raided Scully’s detention cell but found no contraband. “Scully must be enjoying special treatment where he is staying now. Even Margallo admitted that they never lost contact with each other even when Scully was arrested,” Cimafranca said. Scully faces charges of qualified trafficking, child abuse and child pornography in court. Cimafranca said the NBI is starting to monitor Scully’s operations inside the jail to make sure that he will not be able to continue his illegal operations. Scully and Margallo were accused of forcing young children (ages 1 to 12 years old) to perform sexual acts, torturing them and killing one of the kids in the process.  Cagayan de Oro–based lawyer Alejandro Jose Pallugna, who served as Scully’s lawyer for seven months from the time the accused was arrested, said the foreigner had incessant demands for special treatment in prison. ‘VIP’ request Scully, he said, wanted “special foods” in prison and an electric fan, among other things inside the jail. “In a sense, he’s a demanding person,” Pallugna told Cebu Daily News over the phone yesterday. “At first, he instructed my staff to bring him karne norte (corned beef), pork and beans, eggs and kilos of fresh pork. And then, he said it’s hot inside his cell so he needs an electric fan,” he added. The requests, the lawyer said, were denied by jail officials. Pallugna was asked by Scully’s sister in Australia to defend the accused child molester.  He first acceded to the request but later opted to withdraw as Scully’s legal counsel over various disagreements. “Dili mi magkasinabot. Siya may magbuot kon unsaon pagpadagan sa kaso. Dili na mahimo. Ang abogado maoy nasayud kon unsay angay buhaton. (We just could not agree with each other. He was instructing me what to do. That could not be. As lawyer, I would know what steps we needed to take),” he told CDN over the phone. Pallugna said another lawyer Adonis Gumahad took over but also did not last as Scully’s counsel.  Scully reportedly still does not have a lawyer at this point in time. “Scully appears to be an intelligent man. I could say he was well educated. He speaks and conveys his message very well and talks with sense. He looks normal. It’s hard to believe that he’s a pedophile,” Pallugna said. Pallugna assisted Scully when the latter was arraigned in court in 2015.  The 53-year-old Aussie pleaded not guilty to the charges leveled against him.  “Basically, denial was his defense. He said he did not do anything bad to the kids,” Pallugna said. Scully was indicted for at least 75 cases that involved 14 girls whom he allegedly molested and tortured. Weak cases? Concerns, however, were raised on whether or not the cases will prosper without any physical evidence. Pallugna said that most of the physical evidence against him, including a computer, video camera and memory card, had been destroyed in a fire that razed the Cagayan de Oro Hall of Justice  on January 30, 2015, three weeks before Scully’s arrest. Authorities got hold of the physical evidence against him when they earlier raided his residence in Apovel Subdivision, Cagayan de Oro City,  in Sept. 2014. Another live-in partner of Scully, Carme Ann “Angel” Alvarez, was arrested in that operation. Pallugna said the prosecution should do its best to prove Scully’s guilt “beyond reasonable doubt” otherwise the alleged pedophile will soon find himself free again. “There’s a great possibility that the cases against Scully will be dismissed due to the fact that the physical evidence against him were burned down. Those things are necessary to prove that Scully really had a hand in molesting and torturing the victims,” the veteran lawyer said. “The prosecution should handle the case properly. If Scully gets a good lawyer, there’s really the chance that he can go out of prison,” he added.
But based on his conversations with Scully, does he think his former client was really a cyberporn kingpin? “That I could not say. Let the law take its course. Let the judge decide,” Pallugna said. The money trail Claiming to be the only daughter of a  policeman and a social worker in Cagayan de Oro City, Scully’s girlfriend, Margallo,  introduced herself as “Shannon Carpio” to the people she befriended in Cebu when she started to live here in 2015. Among those she befriended was 26-year-old Juliet Mejares — the caretaker of a posh condominium unit  in Barangay Apas. “She rented there for a month then extended her stay for three more months,” Mejares told CDN on Saturday.  Because she was a good friend of Mejares’ cousin, Margallo was given a discount and was asked to pay  only P 8,000 monthly rental for the condo. At times,  Margallo’s payments were late which led her to move to other condominiums and apartments in Cebu City. Mejares’ cousin earlier told CDN that Margallo had invited friends to an all expense paid trip to Asian cities which  would be paid for by her boyfriend,  Scully. Margallo, according to  Mejares,  is married to a French national working in a “big company in France”, but it was Scully who financed her luxurious lifestyle in Cebu. In fact, Margallo openly talked about Scully whom she claimed had his own business.  “It was a software kind of business and she said there are many people working (in that industry) who earn big income,” Mejares said.
Each time the young friends hung out in establishments along Mango Avenue in Cebu City, Margallo always foot the bill using money Scully had sent, said Mejares.  “I haven’t seen Peter (Scully) personally. I just knew they talked over applications like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Skype,” Mejares said.  The friends did not bother to pry anymore into Scully’s background, trusting that he was in an ordinary “software business.”  None of them would have guessed the gruesomeness of the “software,” Scully sent to his pedophile clients abroad.  In 2015, Margallo also asked Mejares to claim money, sent by Scully, on her behalf through a remittance center in one of Cebu City’s big malls. “During transactions, she was there and I immediately gave her the money,” Mejares added. She recalled that she transacted four times in the remittance center. One of the remittances was sent by a female Australian national believed to be Scully’s sister while the three others were from Filipino men, one of them based in Cagayan de Oro City. “Sometimes she received P25,000 while sometimes she received P18,000,” Mejares said. Asked why people were sending her money, Margallo reportedly replied that many people loved and liked her. Passport Mejares constantly helped Margallo with her money as she claimed to have lost all her government IDs and said her passport was still being processed in Manila.  But months before Margallo  moved out of the condo unit managed by Mejares, the two spent a week in the rented unit where Mejares learned more about Scully’s girlfriend.  Inside the condo, Mejares accidentally came across Margallo’s passport and was surprised to see the name “Gina Carpio” on it, instead of Shannon.  Asked why this was so, Margallo reportedly answered, in jest,  that just like people in show business, “Shannon” was her “screen name.” “We had bonding, had local travels and planned a vacation. She even mentioned about international travels,” Mejares told CDN. The last time Margallo and Mejares saw each other was during last year’s Sinulog over barbecue dinner at the Fuente Osmeña Circle. They parted ways because Margallo had since gone out with her gym friends who loved to party.  Which is just as well for Mejares who could no longer accept her as friend.   “What she did to those children deserves the death penalty,” Mejares said. Vulnerable Lawyer John Tanagho, director of the International Justice Mission (IJM) Cebu Field Office, said that since 2012, at least 165 victims of online sexual exploitation, half of whom were aged three months to 12 years old,  were rescued by IJM in Cebu.   “It’s incredibly disturbing and very sad. Cybersex is definitely one of the darkest and evil crimes that IJM had seen,” he told CDN.  Tanagho said a number of Filipinos fell prey to cybersex, either as victims or perpetrators, due to factors like poverty, widespread internet access and the capacity to speak and understand English. “There is internet access here and there. By just using their laptops and mobile devices, they can already livestream sexual abuses either in internet café or within the confines of their homes,” he explained. Tanagho said they are hoping that the menace of cybertrafficking and sexual exploitation will soon end. “These are serious crimes that violate Philippine laws. It causes severe trauma on children. That is why the government is serious in trying to end the problem,” he said.";No news category;No Tags;https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/120897/120897;12
111;OVAC;Nurture cyberkids to cut risks, UN agencies urge;Philippine Daily Inquirer;Queena N. Lee-Chua;Sun, 01 Nov 2015 03:42:04 PST;article;"CYBERKIDS The higher the use, the greater the risk. INQUIRER PHOTO CYBERKIDS, beware: When it comes to information and communications technology (ICT), the higher the use, the greater risk exposure, whether in the form of content, conduct or contact. This reality was presented during a recent international conference on children’s rights in the digital age where the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (Unesco) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (Unicef) stressed the need for “a clear understanding of the risks” and the need “to build children’s resilience to deal with them.”  During the Unesco-Unicef Asia-Pacific Consultation on “Policies and Initiatives to Promote Children’s Safe, Effective and Responsible Use of ICT” from Sept. 9-11 in Bangkok, where the Philippines was represented by this writer, 60 representatives from various governments, international groups, nongovernment organizations, tech corporations, parents and students came together to suggest policy guidelines for effective ICT use in the region. The meeting was held at the Pullman Hotel in the Thai capital.  As of 2014, almost 38 million out of 100 million Filipinos regularly go online, two-thirds of them below the age of 30. According to EU Kids Online, 66 percent of youth in 33 countries regularly use the Internet in their own bedrooms. Sixty percent of Australian children aged 5 or below use touch-screen devices, said Donell Holloway and Lelia Green of Edith Cowan University. “New touch and swipe technologies make it possible for the 0 to 4’s to use the Internet before walking and talking,” they said.  What lessons were learned from the meeting, and more importantly, what can be done?  One of the points raised was the need to understand the views of the youth on ICT, before creating digital citizenship programs. Another point, nurture young digitally-savvy models. Kneejerk reaction Many schools and parents have a knee-jerk reaction to ICT: the former require digital tablets for their students and the latter purchase smartphones for their young kids before teaching or modeling proper use. When problems arise, they hastily sanction online cheating or gaming, or ban these devices altogether.  In our book “Growing Up Wired,” our team of Ateneo de Manila University and Miriam College researchers based our recommendations on a study of 4,000 Filipino high school students. Many of the best practices came from teens and tweens themselves, with input from families and schools. There is a need to strengthen national child protection systems, such as justice, social welfare, education, health and ICT, the participants in the conference agreed. Out of 22 countries in a Unesco Asia-Pacific survey, only eight have a national agency to coordinate and evaluate various government efforts. These are Bangladesh, Brunei, China, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea and Uzbekistan. More than half of the countries do not provide a national budget or a national program for digital citizenship. School campaigns have been created, but focus and implementation vary widely.   Promoting innovation   The promotion of ICT innovation to address digital issues was also raised. Globally, civic groups are at the forefront of digital citizenship issues. The International Society for Technology in Education has developed standards and made available digital education resources for teachers and students worldwide. In the Philippines, the Southeast Asian Ministers of Education Organization Innotech’s Mobile Technology Toolkit on Cybersafety and Emotional Intelligence helps teachers, parents and students deal with “infollution” (information pollution) and promote cybersafety.

 iKeepSafe, a global alliance of more than 100 policy leaders, educators, law enforcers and public health experts, continuously tracks IT trends on cybersecurity and cyberwellness. Working with industry to promote a healthy ICT environment for the youth was also discussed. In 2008, the UN’s International Telecommunications Union (ITU) launched the Child Online Protection Initiative, calling on industry to “identify, prevent and mitigate any adverse impacts of their products and services on children’s rights.” ITU has identified the following risks for kids going online: child abuse, child pornography, sexual solicitation and cybergrooming, online and gaming addiction, cyberbullying, cyberstalking, phishing attacks, youth-to-youth cybercrimes, anorexia, self-harm or suicide, online fraud, disclosure of private information and spam. To counter these threats, ITU has formulated guidelines for the following: mobile operators; Internet service providers; content providers; online retailers; app developers; user-generated content, interactive and social media service providers; national and public service broadcasting; hardware manufacturers; operating system developers; and app stores. Digital wellness Intel Thailand, for its part, has come up with a Digital Wellness Curriculum. In July 2015, Intel India has also issued an Online Challenge to discover cyberwellness champions. Almost 1 million youth joined the competition, done in collaboration with the government, Unesco, schools and civic groups. Google Asia Pacific has created its own online safety tools: SafeSearch in Google Search; Safety Mode in YouTube; content rating and filtering in Android; teen settings; and notifications in Google+. Google also shares these five tips: “Think before you share.  Protect your stuff.  Know and use your settings.  Avoid scams.  Be positive.” RELATED STORIES Telcos target youth as they move to digital age

112;OVAC;Secluded village in Cebu town identified as cybersex hot spot;Agence France-Presse;Agence France-Presse;Mon, 27 Jan 2014 01:13:58 PST;article;"The now abandoned house that used to streamed live sex acts of children to paedophiles watching online overseas, is seen in the village of Ibabao in Cordova town, Cebu provnce in central Philippines on January 21, 2014. AFP PHOTO /TED ALJIBE CORDOVA, Cebu—In the remote village of Ibabao here, toddlers played oblivious at a nursery as the house next door became part of a horrifying child pornography ring, with live footage of children performing sex acts being streamed online to pedophiles around the world. The depraved scenes in the bungalow were being repeated in many homes throughout the secluded community, where Internet child pornography had for some of its 5,000 residents become more lucrative than fishing or factory work.  “In the beginning, I was shocked. I could not believe this was happening in my town,” Mayor Adelino Sitoy of Cordova in Cebu province told Agence France-Presse (AFP) last week, shortly after police announced they had cracked a global live-streaming pedophile ring in which Ibabao was a key source of the child pornography. But while the village is currently in the spotlight, authorities and child rights advocates say the fast-growing global industry is infecting many parts of the mostly poor Philippines, with thousands of children having been abused.  At first look, the coastal community of Ibabao is a typical close-knit rural village, where many of the longtime residents are relatives or enjoy close and longstanding ties. In scenes echoed across the devoutly Catholic country, its residents regularly attend Masses held in quaint chapels along narrow footpaths and dirt roads.  Parents sell children But police and authorities said that behind the closed doors of the tiny wooden and brick homes, many parents directed their children for sex videos in front of webcams connected via the Internet to paying pedophiles overseas. Other children were lured into the homes of neighbors and forced to perform sex acts in front of webcams, they said. Sitoy said the trade thrived because children were locked secretly inside homes, Ibabao was remote and some elected village leaders with relatives involved ignored the crimes. But some of the videos eventually found their way into the computer files of a known British pedophile two years ago, triggering a global manhunt to track down the perpetrators.  The British man was convicted in March last year and sentenced to eight years in prison. Raids, kids rescued Shortly after, police in the Philippines began carrying out raids in Ibabao and nearby areas with the help of British, Australian and US authorities. One of the raids saw dozens of Filipino policemen and social workers break into the bungalow next to the day-care center in September last year, arresting a couple and rescuing their three children, aged 3, 9 and 11. Two days later, 13 other children, who were being abused in other Ibabao homes, were rescued, according to Philippine police. Residents are generally wary of outsiders but some allowed AFP to interview them on condition of anonymity. Still in operation They said “cybersex dens” remained in operation, but security fears and the Filipino tradition of not interfering with a neighbor’s affairs helped to ensure that people did not pry further or try to stop it. Homemaker Jennifer Canete, 38, was willing to talk openly about the crimes, confirming many people in the community were involved and that she feared her four young children could become victims. Canete said one of her children attended the nursery located next to the house where the three children were being abused. “We were angry that this could happen just near the day care,” she said.

 “I was also afraid, we didn’t know what could happen to our children if they went to school because there were many here who were doing that.” Authorities say they do not know exactly when the trade arrived in Ibabao. Shadowy outsider But, according to local social workers, a Filipino woman from outside the community believed to belong to an organized crime group relocated to the village several years ago and introduced locals to the get-rich-quick scheme. That woman taught residents how to scout for clients in pornographic chat rooms and receive payments through international money transfers, according to the social workers, who did not want to be named for security reasons. Some operators lured friends of their children into their homes and abused them, threatening to harm their parents if they told anyone, the social workers said. $100 a session One parent told AFP a neighbor who had tried to recruit her said clients paid as much as $100 a session, a fortune in a region where the minimum daily wage is the equivalent of about $7. She said the neighbor justified the trade by saying that no actual physical contact took place. “I was angry. We were always taught to protect and love our children,” the woman said.

 “We are not rich, but we are also not poor and desperate. It was an evil thing to do.” Nevertheless, she said that staying silent and steering clear of those involved in the trade was the best thing to do, to avoid any trouble. In announcing the dismantling of the pedophile network, Britain’s National Crime Agency said in mid-January that 11 people had been arrested in the Philippines and 18 elsewhere around the world. Another 733 suspects were being investigated, the British crime agency added. Andrey Sawchenko, Philippine head of the Washington-based International Justice Mission who helped in the arrests, said 39 children had been rescued in Ibabao and elsewhere in the Philippines. Tip of iceberg But this is widely believed to be just the tip of the iceberg, with the British crime agency describing online child sex abuse as a “significant and emerging threat.” “Extreme poverty, the increasing availability of high speed Internet and the existence of a vast and comparatively wealthy overseas customer base has led to organized crime groups exploiting children for financial gain,” it said. Dutch advocate group Terre des Hommes estimates that “tens of thousands” of children are being abused through the cybersex industry just in the Philippines. Last year, the group created a virtual 10-year-old Filipino girl that was deployed in Internet chat rooms to lure pedophiles.

 Over 10 weeks, 20,000 people from 71 countries approached the fake girl asking for sexual performances, according to Terre des Hommes, which passed on the details of the pedophiles to police.

113;OVAC;Another human trafficker nabbed in Talisay, eight minors rescued;No news platform;No Author;Thu, 14 Jun 2018 23:06:41 PST;No news type;THEY never learn. Despite an ongoing crackdown against those involved in cyberpornography, another alleged human trafficker was arrested by police on Thursday afternoon in an entrapment operation in Barangay Cansojong, Talisay City. This time, eight minors aged three to 17 were rescued from the hands of their 31-year-old relative, who allegedly took lewd videos of the victims and sold them online. The Anti-Cybercrime Group (ACG)-Visayas Field Unit nabbed a former call center agent who allegedly offered to sexually abuse three young girls during the entrapment operation.  “She offered us a nude live show of these three minors, aged 10, 14, and 17 for P5,000,” said Chief Insp. Leo Dofiles, ACG-Visayas Field Unit chief. Dofiles said that the suspected human trafficker is related to some of the minors. The operation was done in coordination with the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), Cebu Provincial Police Office (CPPO), and the International Justice Mission (IJM). Atty. John Tanagho, IJM-Cebu Field Office Director, said that of the eight minors, three were confirmed victims. The rest, he said, are considered “at-risk for abuse” since they were inside the suspect’s house when the operation was conducted. “Yesterday’s rescue and entrapment operation shows that multiple police units are actively investigating the perpetrators of online sexual exploitation in Cebu. It’s high time that people respect the dignity of children,” Tanagho said. The 31-year-old was the eighth suspected child trafficker arrested in Cebu this year. The arrest came a day after an Australian national and his Filipina live-in partner were meted life terms by a Cagayan de Oro City court for human trafficking. Peter Gerard Scully and Carme Ann Alvarez were also ordered to pay a fine of P5 million each for forcing children to perform appalling sexual acts and torturing them while taking videos of the ordeal and selling the videos online. The arrest of the Cansojong, Talisay suspect brings to eight the number of cyberporn criminals collared this year. Last June 9, operatives arrested a pregnant suspect in Cordova town for trafficking six children. Last May 16, a mother was arrested and three teenage girls, including her own daughter, were rescued in San Fernando, Cebu. Anti-Online Sexual Exploitation of Children (OSEC) operations were also conducted in Cordova and Talisay City last April 23, and in Lapu-Lapu City last February 26.  ;No news category;No Tags;https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/179785/another-human-trafficker-nabbed-talisay-eight-minors-rescuedamp;13
114;OVAC;California man gets life for buying Filipino children;Associated Press / INQUIRER.net US Bureau;Associated Press / INQUIRER.net US Bureau;2018-01-24T18:30:14+00:00;article;Michael Carey Clemans. AP PHOTO SACRAMENTO, California — A California man was sentenced to life in federal prison Tuesday for buying Filipino children for sex and pornography in what prosecutors called one of most “lurid, willful, and disturbing” child exploitation cases in the nation. U.S. District Judge John Mendez said he was sickened by the crimes committed by Michael Carey Clemans, 57, of Sacramento.  Prosecutors said he gave detailed instructions on how young girls should be posed, how their hair should be cut, whether they should wear makeup or have their bodies oiled. “His true plan was to find young girls, virgins, and then go have sex with them,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Andre Espinosa said. “A 57-year-old man doesn’t have sex with a 7-year-old girl — he rapes her.”  The sentence came after defense attorney Daniel Olmos argued that the judge should consider Clemans’ co-operation in helping authorities catch his co-conspirators. But Mendez agreed with prosecutors, saying the “unthinkable, inexcusable” crimes outweighed the assistance.  “He has taken away the childhood of those victims,” Mendez said. Clemans was an Army veteran with no criminal record who lived in Bangkok for two years while working as a pilot for a small airline. He later returned to Sacramento and lived with his mother while traveling to the Philippines several times. He had “another side to his life,” Mendez said. “Mr. Clemans is a dangerous man. A danger particularly to children.” Authorities said Clemans began conspiring with a woman in the Philippines in 2014 to produce child pornography and obtain girls. He sent the woman, Lyan Tandeg, nearly $6,000 for equipment she used to photograph naked children so he could decide which ones he would rape when he travelled to the country, authorities said.  He directed her to find orphans, victims of typhoons and other vulnerable victims. He paid a co-conspirator, Shellina Atad, to obtain temporary custody of Filipino children and produce child pornography, authorities said. Investigators found three of the children who posed for the pornographic photos, including one called “Angel,” when they were 7, 9, and 10. Prosecutors brought them from the Philippines to Sacramento to testify at Clemans’ trial. Tandeg and Atad were arrested in 2015 and sentenced to 15-year prison terms in the Philippines, according to court documents. At one point, authorities said Clemans was communicating with more than 50 child pornography providers and obtained more than 27,000 child pornography images. The internet and ease of global banking make it extremely easy for child pornographers to communicate, buy and sell children and pornography, and hide their identities, U.S. Attorney McGregor Scott said in highlighting 40 central California convictions over the last four years that brought sentences of 15 years or more. “The internet is borderless,” said Ryan Spradlin, special agent in charge of the U.S. Homeland Security Investigations office in San Francisco. “An image on the web of a child being sexually abused can be seen by anyone anywhere in the world.” Olmos acknowledged the “abhorrent” crimes but argued that Clemans should receive some sentencing consideration because he had a clean criminal record, accepted responsibility and let investigators use his online accounts to set up his co-conspirators for prosecution. A jury found Clemans guilty in September of buying children, conspiracy and travelling with intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct. He previously pleaded guilty to conspiracy, producing and receiving child pornography. Olmos said Clemans will appeal his life sentence. Clemans stood seemingly emotionless during the hearing, but Mendez let him hug his parents and other family members before he was led away.  “Thank you for your support and love,” he told his mother. “I’ll see you on the other side.”;No news category;['child pornography', 'child sex abuse', 'Lyan Tandeg', 'Michael Carey Clemans', 'pedophilia', 'sex crimes', 'Shellina Atad', 'U.S. District Judge John Mendez'];https://usa.inquirer.net/9706/california-man-gets-life-buying-filipino-children;13
115;OVAC;It’s war against ‘kiddie’ porn;Philippine Daily Inquirer;Michael Lim Ubac, Nikko Dizon;Sun, 19 Jan 2014 02:19:03 PST;article;"Presidential Spokesman Edwin Lacierda. INQUIRER FILE PHOTO Malacañang on Saturday swore to crack down on online child abuse in the Philippines, now one of the top 10 countries in the world where child cybersex is rampant. Presidential spokesperson Edwin Lacierda said the Aquino administration would intensify its campaign against cyberpornography, including pouncing on the local protectors of the child cybersex industry.  Speaking on state-run radio two days after Britain announced a global police operation against child cybersex that included arrests in the Philippines, Lacierda said that while the government’s tourism campaign pictured the country as a place where tourists could have “more fun,” its aim was to promote the country as a wholesome destination. “We don’t want to be identified as a haven [for pedophiles],” Lacierda said.  He said the Philippine National Police had been watching the child cybersex industry for some time and Malacañang had designated Justice Secretary Leila de Lima to lead a campaign to dismantle the trade. De Lima heads the Inter-Agency Council Against Trafficking (Iacat), but she said on Friday that the group was not concerned with child abuse alone but also with other forms of human trafficking as well as labor trafficking.  Congress passed an anticybercrime law in September 2012 meant to stamp out cybercrimes, including fraud, identity theft, spamming and child pornography. But the Supreme Court blocked the statute before it could take effect amid a legal challenge that it has yet to rule on. Opponents objected to provisions that would authorize heavy prison terms for online libel, and give the state the power to shut down websites and monitor online activities. De Lima said the freeze was hindering the Department of Justice’s fight against cybercrime. Lacierda said, however, that the case was up for resolution. Lacierda said the law’s provisions were “a ticklish issue,” but expressed hope that telecommunication companies and officials could reach agreement on how to proceed.  Rapid growth The Philippines has rapidly become a key hub of the billion-dollar global child cybersex industry, with operators aided by widespread poverty and legal loopholes that allow them to remain anonymous, according to Senior Supt. Gilbert Sosa, chief of the anticybercrime unit of the PNP. Paying subscribers anywhere in the world can log in to sites operated from Manila and across the archipelago that stream the abuse of Filipino children on the Internet, Sosa tol a news conference Friday. “We are the origin, the source,” Sosa said, adding the industry spread rapidly across the country last year. Police in Britain, Australia and the Philippines announced on Thursday that they had jointly dismantled a pedophile ring that streamed live sexual abuse of Filipino children as young as 6 over the Internet. In some cases, the victims’ parents were involved. Among top 10 Fifteen victims aged between 6 and 15 have been rescued in the joint Operation Endeavor in 12 countries, Britain’s National Crime Agency (NCA) said on Thursday, adding that 29 people had been arrested, including 11 in the Philippines. Three other ongoing investigations have identified 733 suspects, the NCA said. Sosa said the Philippines was a “top 10” purveyor of what he described as a global “cottage industry [worth] billions of dollars.” The victims are mostly younger than 18, he said, recounting how he took part in some police raids in  Angeles City, Pampanga province, where boys and girls aged between 10 and 14 performed “lewd acts” in front of cameras.

 Some of the suspects arrested were Americans or Europeans, with Filipino “cohorts,” he said. In Manila, he said the streaming was done inside hotel rooms. It is also done in 31 of the Philippines’ 81 provinces, with Angeles, Cebu City and Cagayan de Oro City in Misamis Oriental province being the other main sites. Sosa said some of the streaming was done inside shanties in the sprawling slums of the country where one in four people live on less than P50 a day, according to government data. “The parents themselves facilitate the children’s participation,” Sosa said, adding their earnings help support the families. Video streaming earned them at least $100 (P4,500) an hour, and photo sessions were worth up to $66 (P3,000), he added. Sosa said most people who paid to view the activity were from the United States and Europe. “There is no interest in child pornography in our culture. So it is mostly production,” he said. Produced in PH Tens of thousands of child cybersex images were likely to have been transmitted from all over the Philippines in 2012 alone, Senior Insp. Levy Lozada, chief of the PNP Anticybercrime Group Digital Forensic Laboratory, told the Inquirer on Saturday. An NCA online map obtained by the Inquirer showed pins all over the Philippines, indicating the places from where images of child abuse had been transmitted.

 Lozada said every pin indicated an Internet protocol (IP) address through which pornographic materials were sent to Western countries. Part of Operation Endeavor, the map showed four hot spots: Angeles City, Cebu City, Cagayan de Oro City and Metro Manila. In Manila, Lozada said an IP address had been found to have transmitted 640 copies of lewd videos and photos of children. Lozada said the NCA collected the data through the transmittals received by subscribers in Britain whom the authorities had been monitoring. “The production (of the pornographic materials) takes place in the Philippines,” Lozada said. The materials are then sent to clients overseas, mostly in the United States and Britain. “We will be updating our data in the first quarter of this year,” Lozada said. “We’ll have an exchange of data with [the NCA’s Child Exploitation and Online Protection command].” Difficult to trace In 2012, the PNP Anti-Cybercrime Group investigated child cybersex in 18 provinces in Luzon, six in the Visayas and seven in Mindanao. Lozada said it was difficult to trace the cyberporn streamers because of the Internet’s global reach and the “dynamic nature” of the business.

 “You use one IP address, which you could then assign to others,” he said. He said digital forensics focused on the extraction of data or the recovery of digital information from computers or USBs. Tracing the owners of the IP addresses lies mainly with the telecommunication companies, he said. “This is why we really need the telcos’ cooperation. When we find out the IP address used to send the pornographic material, then it is the telcos that can trace the specific user,” Lozada said. That law is needed Sosa explained on Friday that the crime had spread because of the confidentiality observed by the telcos, but the anticybercrime law would have dealt with that difficulty. “Under that law, telcos are required to retain their data or log files within a period of six months. Since there is a temporary restraining order, there is no legal basis for them to comply,” Sosa said. Ronald Aguto, cybercrime division chief of the justice department’s National Bureau of Investigation, said on Friday that Filipino law enforcers were making do with other laws to go after offenders, including one against child pornography. But these were not enough, he said. “In these matters, time is of the essence. We need to swiftly get the data from Internet providers,” he said in an interview over dzBB radio.

 On Saturday, Gabriela party-list Rep. Luz Ilagan said Congress needed to enact new measures to protect children and women from sexual exploitation. Ilagan urged the House committees on the welfare of children and women and gender equality to call hearings on pedophilia and child pornography to see what new laws could be enacted to fight child cybersex and the sexual exploitation of women.

116;OVAC;FEED to protect your child online;No news platform;No Author;Thu, 03 Dec 2015 02:08:07 PST;No news type;PARENTS should develop online skills and follow the formula F-E-E-D to be able to protect their children from cyber abuses. F-E-E-D, according to online safety advocate Severo “Sonnie” Santos, stands for Filter, Engage, Educate and Discipline. “There are parental controls in your gadgets like in computers which can filter the internet usage of your kids. You can control the time and sites and programs they can access,” Santos shared during the “Good Parenting in the Cyberage” symposium yesterday. Santos spearheads Cyber wellness campaign where Digital Parenting module is one of the initiatives to raise awareness among parents the online risks and promote smart use of social web.  He said parents with online skills would find it easy to engage and educate their kids on the responsible use of the Internet. There should also be trust between the parents and their children. For example, Santos said he, his wife and kids know each other’s passwords to their social media accounts. “I want them to know that they can trust me when anything happens,” said Santos. But at the same time, he said it is important to monitor the people that the children are in contact with online. Instilling discipline is unpleasant, but necessary. Santos said parents should know when to cut off the Internet connection, especially for children using mobile gadgets. Children using personal computers are easier to monitor. The PC should be placed in a common area, where parents would be able to view the online sites that a child visits and programs that he opens. Aside from regulating Internet use, parents should also be role  models and show their children that it’s possible to spend time away from  gadgets. Dr. Stella Manalo, a developmental-behavioral pediatrician, said parents should limit “screen time” spent on gadgets, while the children are young. “There should be rules and curfew times where kids have to surrender their gadgets. You also have to teach your housemaids not to use a mobile phone in front of kids. And of course, you yourself have to get off your phone,” Manalo said in the same symposium. The cyberage parenting was part of the two-day “Ako Para sa Bata” (I am for the Child)  conference held at the Marco Polo Plaza. Seven government and private organizations committed to support the fight against online child abuse during the conference. Representatives of  Shift + CTRL + Del Conference, Department of Education, Philippine Pediatric Society (PPS), Terres des Hommes Netherlands country office, ECPAT Philippines, International Justice Mission (IJM) and Unicef Philippines made the commitment yesterday. PPS representative Dr. Milagros Bautista said child protection will be integrated into the residency training program for pediatricians. Lotta Sylawander, Unicef representative to the Philippines, said they will continue to support efforts to assist child victims of online sexual exploitation and prosecute the cases. “Unicef will support the establishment and effective use of reporting mechanisms to ensure that child victims of online exploitation and abuse have access to quality support services in accordance with international standards and practices,” she said.;No news category;No Tags;https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/76653/feed-to-protect-your-child-online;13
117;OVAC;CamSur mother arrested for selling 3 daughters in cyberporn – PNP;Philippine Daily Inquirer;Julie M. Aurelio;Fri, 29 Apr 2016 00:43:22 PST;article;FILE PHOTO MANILA — A 31-year-old mother was arrested in Camarines Sur for allegedly pimping her three young daughters in online child pornography. For $25 to $75 per session, the woman would sell her daughters aged 7, 9 and 11 to foreign pedophiles she met through a pornographic website.  The Philippine National Police’s Anti-Cybercrime Group said the mother was arrested at her house in Barangay Salvacion, Calabanga in Camarines Sur on Wednesday night. The raid was carried out by virtue of a search warrant by a Naga City court.  The ACG head, Senior Supt. Guillermo Lorenzo Eleazar, said the woman’s daughters, as well as her one-year-old son, were rescued during the operation. The woman was caught in the act of selling her eldest daughter for cybersex when she was arrested.  The police official warned parents against engaging their young children in online child pornography.  “The effects of that is devastating on children and cannot be erased, even if they claim that there is no physical contact with the client. They will carry it with them into adulthood,” Eleazar said. Eleazar said they received a tip from the United States-based National Center for Missing and Exploited Children on a child pornography ring based in Camarines Sur. Months of surveillance revealed that the mother, a high school graduate, sold her own daughters to foreign pedophiles who would make the children pose nude and perform sexual acts. Pretending to be interested clients, the ACG also contacted the mother, who was using Yahoo Messenger and Skype to lure the clients.  Most of the clients were from the U.S., Australia, Europe and other parts of Asia. During the raid, policemen recovered two laptops, six cell phones, a router, a canopy antenna, and remittance receipts from her clients. The Camarines Sur provincial prosecutor recommended no bail for the woman, who was charged with child pornography under Republic Act 10175 or the Cybercrime Prevention Act, RA 7610 or the Anti-Child Abuse Act, and RA 10364 or the Expanded Anti-Trafficking Act. Her children were turned over to local social welfare workers for safekeeping. The woman’s husband, who was often out of the house due to work, denied knowledge about his wife’s illegal activities. Eleazar, however, said the husband might also be investigated for his wife’s activities.

118;OVAC;Taguig raid rescues 8 kids from online sex den;Agence France-Presse;Agence France-Presse;Fri, 12 Jun 2015 02:48:40 PST;article;"The police have freed eight girls aged 13 to 18 from a house in Taguig City where they were allegedly being forced to engage in sexual acts for online viewers in the United States, Japan and other countries. The raid, which was conducted on Wednesday night, also led to the arrest of the mastermind, Christopher Villanueva, 33; and the mother of three of the children, authorities said Thursday.  Villanueva was accused of forcing the girls to have sex with him and with each other in front of web cameras. Policemen, acting on a tip from the US Department of Homeland Security, found sex toys, web cameras and laptop computers during the raid on Villanueva’s house in Taguig City.  The mother of three of the abused children who lives nearby was also arrested after she was accused of forcing her children to engage in sex for money. The other children are also believed to be residents in the area. Online child abuse was the leading cyber-related crime in the country last year, making up 46 percent of the 200 reported cases, according to the Department of Justice.  According to Alex Nuqui, head of the National Bureau of Investigation’s antihuman trafficking division, Villanueva reportedly charged customers in the US, Britain, Australia and Japan between $50 and $100 to watch the children having sex. He was caught after a US agent, posing as an online customer, struck a deal to sleep with one of the girls at his house for P5,000. Nuqui said that Villanueva told the undercover US agent in an online chat: “They (the children) will fulfill all your fantasies. Come to the Philippines.” His arrest is the second time in three months that US assistance has led Philippine authorities to cybersex suspects as part of an international operation to stamp out pedophile rings operating online. In February, a 51-year-old Australian, Gerard Peter Scully, was arrested for allegedly sexually abusing eight girls, including an infant, and murdering one of them.  In March, four Filipinos were arrested and two children were rescued in another raid in Pateros.

Dorothea V. Chia, Haniel Caetano De Oliveira and Marshal Ruskin, the DOJ also ordered the NBI to coordinate with the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) and take custody of the minors and provide them with post-care treatment.  “[The NBI is ordered] to conduct further investigation as to the other involved conspirators/cohorts whether local or foreign nationals/residents, tagged and/or implicated, directly or indirectly in the evidence at hand including the possible identification of the; a. cybernames (usernames/user IDs, email addresses); b. contact numbers; c. cyberlocations (including Internet Protocol addresses and recorded places/sites if any); d. websites and e. web applications,” the DOJ said. The DOJ noted that based on the NBI-Cybercrime Division digital forensic reports, there are still many victims of cybertrafficking yet to be rescued and be given immediate assistance.  The DOJ added that cyber perverts are still feasting on the nude videos of at least five minor victims including that of an 18-month old baby. It also ordered an investigation of foreign nationals Ingo Geres, Christian Bogo and Jens Van Dijk whose names appeared in the records of the case.  Scully and the other accused were arrested last year. Scully has a pending case before the Cagayan de Oro Regional Trial Court Branch 37 for the sexual abuse of two girls aged 9 and 12 known as the “Apovel case” because it was committed at Apovel Subdivision in Barangay Buluan in Cagayan. The two victims were able to escape and narrate their ordeal to their parents. Scully was able to lure the parents of their victims under the guise of taking good care of them, feeding them and sending them to school. Instead, the victims, whom they call “little ones,” were exploited, abused and molested. The 69 criminal cases – eight counts of qualified trafficking in persons committed by a syndicate,five counts of syndicated child pornography, nine counts of child abuse, five counts of indecent shows, obscene exhibitions and publications, four counts of Child pornography under the Cybercrime Prevention Act, 25 counts of photo and video Voyeurism and 13 counts of rape – will be filed in various courts before the Cagayan de Oro City, Surigao City and Malaybalay City./rga";Nation;['Department of Justice', 'National Bureau of Investigation', 'Peter Gerard Scully'];https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/814996/child-porn;13
123;OVAC;In the Know: The cybercrime law;Philippine Daily Inquirer;Philippine Daily Inquirer;Wed, 19 Feb 2014 05:31:04 PST;article;"Suspects in an alleged internet porn operation cover their faces as they stay at the Cybercrime division of the National Bureau of Investigation in Manila, Philippines on Tuesday, Feb. 18, 2014. RA 10175, or the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012, punishes content-related offenses such as cybersex, child pornography and libel which may be committed through a computer system. AP PHOTO/AARON FAVILA Republic Act No. 10175, or the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012, was signed into law by President Aquino on Sept. 12, 2012. Its original goal was to penalize acts like cybersex, child pornography, identity theft and unsolicited electronic communication in the country.  However, a provision expanding the scope of libel law to cover Internet posts was opposed by various groups, which asked the Supreme Court to issue a temporary restraining order (TRO) and a status quo ante order. The cybercrime law could see Internet users sentenced to up to 12 years in prison for posting defamatory comments on Facebook or Twitter.  Online libel was not part of the original bill proposed by the Department of Justice (DOJ) but was one of the amendments inserted by the Senate as proposed by Sen. Vicente Sotto III.    On Oct. 9, 2012, six days after the law took effect, the Supreme Court issued a four-month injunction while it scrutinized the law for possible violations of constitutional provisions on freedom of expression. On Feb. 6 last year, the high court extended the TRO indefinitely.  RA 10175 punishes content-related offenses such as cybersex, child pornography and libel which may be committed through a computer system. It also penalizes unsolicited commercial communication or content that advertises or sells products or services. But there are exemptions relating to the sending of unsolicited material: It is not a crime if there is prior consent from the recipient, the communication is an announcement from the sender to users, and if there is an easy, reliable way for the recipient to reject it, among others. Individuals found guilty of cybersex face a jail term of prision mayor (6 years and one day to 12 years) or a fine of at least P200,000 but not exceeding P1 million. Child pornography via computer carries a penalty one degree higher than that provided by RA 9775, or the Anti-Child Pornography Act of 2009. Under RA 9775, those who produce, disseminate or publish child pornography will be fined from P50,000 to P5 million, and slapped a maximum jail term of reclusion perpetua, or 20 to 40 years.  Persons found guilty of unsolicited communication face arresto mayor (imprisonment for 1 month and 1 day to 6 months) or a fine of at least P50,000 but not more than P250,000, or both. The law also penalizes offenses against the confidentiality, integrity and availability of computer data and system, such as illegal access, illegal interference, data interference, system interference, misuse of devices, and cybersquatting. It defines cybersquatting as the acquisition of a domain name on the Internet in bad faith or with the intent to profit, mislead, destroy one’s reputation or deprive others from registering the same domain name. Also covered by the law are computer-related forgery, fraud and identity theft. As many as 87 percent of Filipino Internet users were identified as victims of crimes and malicious activities committed online, according to a November 2012 primer released by the DOJ, which quoted a 2010 report of the security software firm Symantec. These included being victimized in activities such as malware (virus and Trojan) invasion, online or phishing scams and sexual predation. From 2003 to 2012, the Anti-Transnational Crime Division of the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group of the Philippine National Police looked into 2,778 referred cases of computer crimes from government agencies and private individuals nationwide.—Inquirer Research   Sources: Inquirer Archives   RELATED STORIES

124;OVAC;GERMAN CHILD TRAFFICKER GETS LIFE;No news platform;No Author;Fri, 06 Jul 2018 23:36:45 PST;No news type;Thomas Michael Ruhland, a German national accused of trafficking minors, during his arrest at a motel in Talisay City on Feb. 2, 2011. A German national who was tagged as a member of a global child pornography syndicate was convicted on Friday by the Cebu City Regional Trial Court (RTC) for taking nude photos of two teenage girls in a motel in Talisay City in 2011. Thomas Michael Ruhland, 46, was found guilty of qualified trafficking and child abuse, and was meted the penalty of life imprisonment and another 20 years in jail for the two charges, respectively. He was also ordered to pay a fine of at least P3.4 million to the two victims, aged 16 and 14. In his decision, Judge Jose Andal of RTC Branch 24 in Cebu City gave credence to the testimonies of the victims over the denial of the accused.  “This court is fully convinced and so finds that the accused performed all the elements in the commission of the offense,” he said. “He (Ruhland) did maintain and hire the victims to engage in pornography by offering them money in exchange for their nude pictures. He took advantage of their vulnerability to attain his purpose of exploiting them,” he added. The link Regional State Prosecutor Fernando Gubalane said items seized from Swedish national Bengt Kristofferson led authorities to Ruhland and the identification of Kristofferson’s other contacts and victims in Cebu. Kristofferson was convicted in Sweden for child pornography in 2013. “It appeared that Kristofferson had been communicating with women in Cebu, directing the sexual abuse of young Filipino girls ages 4 to 11,” said Gubalane, who is closely coordinating with the International Justice Mission, a group that actively campaigns against online sexual exploitation of children. “We cannot allow brutal abuse and exploitation of children to continue without accountability,” he added. Cybersex is a billion-dollar global industry that proliferates with easy access on the Internet. During the promulgation of the Ruhland case on Friday, the accused was represented by a temporary counsel since his lawyer, Salvador Solima, was killed inside his residence in Barangay Guadalupe, Cebu City just last Monday. Police have arrested and filed murder charges against three persons who allegedly had a hand in Solima’s killing. Solima’s wife was also wounded during the incident. The Solima murder was believed to have nothing to do with the case involving Ruhland as the police had said that unsettled debts over a land that Solima’s wife purchased was seen as the motive behind the murder. ‘Justice is served’ Lawyer Noemi Truya-Abarientos of the Children’s Legal Bureau (CLB) said they were expecting Ruhland to contest his conviction before the Court of Appeals. But for now, Abarientos said CLB, which actively prosecuted Ruhland, was elated with the outcome of the case. “Justice is served, and we hope that this trend continues. I hope this (case) sets as an example to the others that they just can’t do things like these to our children,” she told the Cebu Daily News.. Abarientos warned the public not to be deceived by people who hire them as models but are actually going to sexually exploit them. “Modeling is nice to hear and ploys like these continue. I beg you not to be vigilant so you won’t fall prey to them,” she said. The father of one of the girls’ exploited by Ruhland earlier sought the assistance of the National Bureau of Investigation in Central Visayas (NBI-7) after he learned that his daughter went with the accused. Agents of the NBI hatched an entrapment operation which led to the arrest of Ruhland inside a motel in Talisay City on February 2, 2011. Two girls were rescued during the operation. Abarientos said authorities found out that Ruhland had hired girls to pose naked in exchange for certain amounts of money. Horror stories A 14-year-old victim said Ruhland didn’t just take nude photos of him but also raped her. During court trial, Ruhland admitted taking photos of girls but said they were not for pornography but just to entice people to buy houses for sale. “He (Ruhland) said the presence of girls in the photos of houses will help sell the property,” Abarientos said. “His denial, however, did not convince the judge,” he added. Ruhland is currently detained at the Cebu Provincial Detention and Rehabilitation Center. Cebu Vice Gov. Agnes Magpale, co-chair of the Provincial Women’s Commission, said the fight against sexual exploitation of minors and other forms of human trafficking shall continue. “There’s definitely no let up in our campaign,” she said. Cyberporn mothers on the lam As this developed, the Philippine National Police Women and Children Protection Center (WCPC)–Visayas Field Unit announced that they filed a string of cases against seven suspected online traffickers from Cordova town, Cebu for exposing children to cyberpornography. The respondents, some of whom are mothers, remain at large. “We filed a case against them so that the long arm of the law will catch them up,” said Senior Supt. Romeo Perigo, chief of the WCPC-Visayas Field Unit, in a press conference on Friday. Identities of the respondents were kept confidential pending resolution of the cases filed against them. Cordova Mayor Mary Therese Sitoy–Cho, meanwhile, urged barangay officials to help monitor activities in the municipality, which police authorites have tagged as a hotspot for cyberpornography. “Yes, there are still those who engage in that kind of business. The monitoring shall continue,” she said. /WITH USJ-R INTERN GERARD VINCENT FRANCISCO;No news category;No Tags;https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/183161/german-child-trafficker-gets-life;14
125;OVAC;Church folk warned vs priest fleeing US child porn case;Inquirer Visayas;Nestor P. Burgos Jr.;Fri, 04 Nov 2011 20:22:16 PST;article;ILOILO CITY—Top Church officials here have issued an alert for an Iloilo-born priest who fled theft and child pornography charges in the United States. The Archdiocese of Jaro asked members of the clergy to be on the lookout for Fr. Lowe Dongor, who was born in Iloilo and was assigned to the Diocese of Worcester in Massachusetts.  Jaro Archbishop Angel Lagdameo issued a circular on Oct. 26 to issue a warning against clergy members dealing with Dongor.  Lagdameo said the Jaro Archdiocese adopted the decision of the Diocese of Worcester to prohibit Dongor from wearing priest attire and performing functions as a priest. Dongor, 35, a native of Barotac Nuevo, a town 30 km northeast of Iloilo City, left Worcester without permission while awaiting trial on charges of theft and possession of materials on child pornography, according to Worcester Bishop Robert  McManus in a letter to Archbishop Nereo Odchimar, president of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines (CBCP).  Dongor has reportedly been seen in his hometown last week and has even officiated Mass. In his letter dated Oct. 13, McManus said Dongor was removed from Worcester pending his trial. “I removed Father Dongor from active ministry and informed him that he could not wear clerical attire or present himself publicly as a priest,” McManus said in his letter. He said that based on a position of the Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith, the “acquisition, possession and distribution of child pornography is a canonical delict that pertains to the sexual abuse of a minor.”  The letter did not provide further details of the accusations against Dongor. But according to a Sept. 19 report of the Catholic Free Press on the Internet, Dongor, former associate pastor of St. Joseph’s Parish, was arraigned on Sept. 13 in the Fitchburg District Court on charges of possession of child pornographic materials, theft of more than $250 and other charges. “He is accused of having pictures on his laptop of girls around the ages of 10 and 11 in various stages of undress. He also is accused of having stolen $40 or $50 on several occasions from the parish office, according to police reports,” the report said. It said Dongor was removed from his ministry in July by McManus “after financial improprieties were discovered at the parish.” McManus said in his letter to the CBCP that Dongor “fled” the diocese before his Oct. 25 trial. He left a note saying he was returning “home” which McManus presumed was the Philippines. “I bring this matter to your excellency’s attention in case Father Dongor presents himself to bishops in the archdioceses or dioceses of the Philippines as a priest in good canonical standing. Obviously this is not the case,” McManus said.;;['Children', 'Church', 'Crime', 'Lowe Dongor', 'Pornography', 'United States'];https://globalnation.inquirer.net/17123/church-folk-warned-vs-priest-fleeing-us-child-porn-case;14
126;OVAC;87% of Filipino Internet users have been victims of cybercrimes–DOJ;Philippine Daily Inquirer;Christine O. Avendaño;Tue, 01 Jan 2013 23:49:14 PST;article;"MANILA, Philippines — Almost 9 out of 10 Filipino Internet users have been victimized by cybercrime or a malicious activity on the Internet at one time or another, the Department of Justice (DOJ) primer on facts and trends about cybercrimes committed in the country, said on Tuesday. The primer on Philippine cybercrime has been prepared by the DOJ as part of its advocacy program to prevent abuses in cyberspace as the legality of the new law against cybercrime is being deliberated in the Supreme Court.  In October 2012, the implementation of the new Cyber-crime Prevention Act of 2012 was suspended by the high tribunal for four months until Feb.6 following 15 petitions seeking for the law to be declared unconstitutional wholly or partially. The high court is set to hear on Jan.15 oral arguments on the law that became controversial because of its provisions that included the criminalization of online libel. In the three-page primer presented in a question and answer format, the DOJ said that cybercrime has become “one of the fastest growing crimes globally.”  In the Philippines, the primer quoted a 2010 report of the security software firm Symantec that as many as 87 percent of Filipino internet users (nearly nine out of 10) were identified as victims of crimes and malicious activities committed online. These included being victimized in activities such as malware (virus and Trojan) invasion; online or phishing scams; sexual predation; and services in social networking site like Facebook and Twitter. From 2003 to 2012, the Anti-Transnational Crime Division (ATCD) of the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG) of the Philippine National Police (PNP) looked into 2,778 referred cases of computer crimes from government agencies and private individuals nationwide.  The primer defined cybercrime as a crime committed “with or through the use of information and communication technologies such as radio, television, cellullar phone, computer and network, and other communication device or application.”  Quoting the 2001 Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, the primer said there were four types of cybercrime — offenses against the confidentiality, integrity and availability of computer data systems; computer-related offenses; content-related offenses and offenses related to infringements of copyright and related rights. The primer also noted that the first cybercrime case in the country was the controversial case involving Onel de Guzman who in 2000 released the “I Love You” virus. “The case filed against De Guzman was dismissed at the first stage because there was no law punishing the deed as of that time in May 2000 in the Philippines,” it said. The primer also said that two cybercriminals had been convicted for hacking under Republic Act no. 8792 or the Electronic Commerce Act or the E-Commerce Act. The first conviction involved a person caught hacking the government portal gov.ph and other government websites while the other involved a person who used the Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) call center provider Sitel Philippines Corporation to illegally secure credit card information from the company’s sister firm, Sitel USA.  Since the new law against cybercrime has been suspended, the government is dealing with cybercrime-related cases using existing laws such as the E-Commerce Act, RA 9995 or the Anti-Photo and Voyeurism Act of 2009, RA 9725 or the Anti-Child Pornography Act of 2009, RA 9208 or the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2003, RA 8484 or the Access Device Regulation Act of 1998 and RA 4200 or the Anti-Wire Tapping Law.";Internet;['Access Device Regulation Act of 1998', 'Anti-Child Pornography Act of 2009', 'Anti-Photo and Voyeurism Act of 2009', 'Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2003', 'Anti-Wire Tapping Law', 'cyber crimes', 'Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012', 'E-Commerce Act', 'Internet', 'RA 4200', 'RA 8484', 'RA 9208', 'RA 9725', 'RA 9995', 'technology'];https://technology.inquirer.net/21557/87-of-filipino-internet-users-have-been-victims-of-cybercrimes-doj;14
128;OVAC;AUSTRALIAN CHILD TRAFFICKER, PINAY GET LIFE;No news platform;No Author;Wed, 13 Jun 2018 22:19:14 PST;No news type;SCULLY The cases against Liezyl Margallo, who was arrested in Cebu and described by authorities as ‘savage girl,’ are still pending.  A notorious child trafficker who ran a gruesome international cyberpornography trade from the Philippines will spend the rest of his life in jail. Peter Gerard Scully, an Australian, and his erstwhile Filipino partner, were found guilty by a court in Cagayan de Oro City on Wednesday for forcing children to perform appalling sexual acts and torturing them while taking videos of the ordeal. The 55-year-old foreigner was meted a life imprisonment for qualified trafficking. He also got an additional six years to nine years and 11 months for five counts of rape by sexual abuse.  His former live-in partner Carme Ann Alvarez, who allegedly lured female street children and young scavengers into their fold, also received the same penalty. Each of them were ordered to pay a fine of P5 million, P500,000 as moral damages, and P100,000 as exemplary damages. Judge Jose Escobido of the Regional Trial Court Branch 37 in Cagayan de Oro gave credence to the testimonies of the two victims who managed to escape from the rented house of Scully in the same city in 2014. Merlynn Uy, officer in charge of the Regional Prosecutor’s Office in Northern Mindanao, considered Scully’s conviction a welcome relief. “This is a very positive development and it sends a strong message to the public in general that our laws do not look kindly on human traffickers,” she told Cebu Daily News over the phone. Scully, who appeared calm during the promulgation, did not issue any statement, she said. He and his other partner, Liezyl Margallo, are still facing at least 50 other qualified trafficking cases in Cagayan de Oro, Bukidnon and Surigao. While most of the victims are from Mindanao, investigators said it was possible that Scully and his cohorts also victimized minors in Cebu and other parts of the country. “It’s possible that there are also other minors who fell prey to Scully in other parts of the country, including Cebu,” Uy said. ‘Savage girl’ Margallo, who was described by authorities as the “savage girl,” was arrested by agents of the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) while she was strolling along the shoreline of Malapascua Island off the mainland northern Cebu town of Daanbantayan in January 2017. Margallo was later transferred to the Cagayan de Oro City Jail where she remains detained to this day for the still unresolved child trafficking cases filed against her. Scully, Margallo and Alvarez reportedly conspired in enticing poor kids to go with them. A video provided by the Dutch police showed a naked 1-year-old girl who was hung upside down with her hands tied and legs drawn apart. The girl, known in the video as “Daisy,” was crying nonstop while being tortured and sexually assaulted by a masked older girl later identified as Margallo. The attacker on the video repeatedly whipped the toddler with a belt, placed a duct tape on her lips to silence her cries and dropped hot wax from a melted candle on her private parts. The film clip, described by the NBI as the “worst video” they have seen in their years of campaign against child pornography, used at least nine children, including a 12-year-old girl, whose remains were exhumed in Scully’s apartment in Villa Corito, Surigao City. Non-governmental organizations such as  Bantay Kaso (Kagay-anongs Against Sex Offenders) are closely monitoring all cases filed against Scully and his cohorts. Uy said the two victims aged 10 and 13 had a very detailed narration of the ordeal they suffered under the hands of Scully when they were detained inside the foreigner’s rented house in Cagayan de Oro from September 19 to 23, 2014. “They were sexually abused, bound by chains, and were even made to dig their own graves. They were supposed to be killed after the abuse. The good thing was when Scully and Alvarez went out of the house for an errand, these two kids managed to escape and immediately reported what happened to the police,” she said. A thorough investigation led to the arrest of Alvarez who told the police about Scully’s identity. Scully was subsequently arrested by the NBI in Malaybalay, Bukidnon in February 2015 and is currently detained at the jail facility in Cagayan de Oro City. Uy said eight other victims of Scully, aged 1 to 12 years old, were rescued in 2015 and are currently under the custody of the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) Global manhunt A number of controversial videos uploaded on the internet by Scully sparked a global manhunt for the video producer. Earlier, Scully was under investigation by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission for defrauding more than $2.68 million from 20 investors in an investment scheme. Scully, a father of two, slipped out of Melbourne and fled to Manila in 2011 where he allegedly established a lucrative business by videotaping lewd actions of minors. Lawyer Janet Francisco, head of the NBI Anti-Human Trafficking Division (AHTRAD), said Scully would cater to clients, mostly child predators, from across the globe, who paid for live stream videos of children being tortured and sexually abused. The fee for every transaction was US$10,000. With the use of a laptop, Scully and his cohorts filmed the videos, featuring young girls who were lured with promises of money and comfortable lives. Scully was quoted in an Australian TV interview as saying that he was not afraid to languish in jail. “If I get sentenced, I get sentenced. That is something out of my control … There is nothing I can do about it, so why worry about it?” Scully said in an interview with Tara Brown of 60 Minutes, a current affairs program in Australia. Francisco said the NBI continues to locate other possible members of Scully’s group whose sadistic and pornographic videos are being financed by a worldwide syndicate with members coming from Brazil,  Germany and the United Kingdom. Judge Escobido has ordered the Philippine National Police to go after those people who continue to disseminate the videos showing Scully’s victims. Uy lauded the prosecution led by state lawyers Ruby Malanog and Charisse Bitoon who helped the victims find justice in court. “There’s no let up in our campaign to prevent, if not eliminate, human trafficking in all regions in the country. And we shall continue to actively prosecute cases against Scully,” she said.;No news category;No Tags;https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/179706/australian-child-trafficker-pinay-get-life-2;14
130;OVAC;Standing up to bullies;Philippine Daily Inquirer;Philippine Daily Inquirer;Sun, 29 Dec 2019 05:07:53 PST;article;"Results of the latest Pisa study, the Programme for International Student Assessment survey published by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development alarmed the public recently. This was because Filipino students ended up at the bottom for reading comprehension and second-to-last in science and mathematics among students from 79 countries. Getting minimal attention, though, were results of another aspect of the study. According to the Pisa, based on the students’ own self-assessment, at least 6 in 10 Filipino students are being bullied regularly. The frequency of bullying in local schools is nearly three times higher compared to rates reported by students from developed countries. A detailed examination of the results showed that about 65 percent of more than 7,000 15-year-old Filipino students “reported being bullied at least a few times a month.” The figure, it was noted, is higher compared to the 23-percent average reported by students from 36 developed nations, including the United States, Japan, China and European countries.  What’s more, the same study found that 26 percent of students here felt “lonely at school.” The study noted that “in most countries and economies, students were more likely to report positive feelings when they reported a stronger sense of belonging at school and greater student cooperation.” However, they “were more likely to express sadness when they were bullied more frequently.” The silver lining to this dismal situation, though, is that “95 percent of Filipino student-respondents said they sometimes or always feel happy,” while 84 percent said “it is a good thing to help students who cannot defend themselves.”  Early this year, the Psychological Association of the Philippines (PAP) urged parents to listen to their children and take reports of bullying seriously. The National Baseline Study on Violence against Children has found that three out of five Filipino children have experienced peer violence. The association alerted parents that “children may not disclose experiences of bullying because they believe such reports may be trivialized, seen to be their fault, or responded to in ways that may worsen rather than solve their problems.” Thus, it urged parents to engage in “consultations with teachers, conflict resolution sessions or constructive advocacy work,” while schools were encouraged to take a “holistic or whole-school approach to bullying prevention.”  “This approach nurtures a positive school climate and is more effective than programs focusing only on the victim and the perpetrator,” said the PAP, which also pointed out that bullying is a “systemic problem,” meaning there are family, peer group, school and sociocultural factors that perpetuate bullying. “(Bullying) is not solely rooted in the child,” it noted. A child’s “brain and character are developing and is strongly influenced by his or her relationships and environment.” To this, we must add our voices against the new, even more alarming forms of bullying carried out through social media, where such incidents end up even farther away from the eyes of parents and caring adults, unfettered by civilizing norms of proper behavior and language, and by their very reach utterly dangerous. According to a Unicef study published in September, cyberviolence affects almost half of Filipino children aged 13-17, and that “One-third of cyberviolence… are in the form of verbal abuse over the internet or cellphone, while a fourth are through sexual messages.”“Violence against children, in all forms including online bullying or cyberbullying, has devastating effects on the physical and emotional wellbeing of young people,” warned Unicef. “This can create lasting emotional and psychological scars, even physical harm.”Indeed, it can be safely said that a nation that tolerates and even encourages bullying, in whatever form, among its citizens, but especially among its children, would reap the whirlwind of a generation of adult bullies, who know no language other than intimidation, character assassination and worse, aggression, violence and even murder.  What are adults who were bullied as children to do? The habits of accommodation, compromise and cowardice are difficult to shake off, true, but we can begin now by standing up for our own children—by demanding safer spaces for them at school, in the community and online; by calling on the government to see this issue as a matter of serious public interest; and by teaching young people to value themselves, to find within themselves the fires of defiance and self-defense, and to take to heart what Eleanor Roosevelt once said: “No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.”";Columns;['bully', 'Economic Cooperation and Development', 'Filipino students', 'study'];https://opinion.inquirer.net/126192/standing-up-to-bullies;14
132;OVAC;Globe Telecom, Wattpad team up for #makeITsafePH cyberwellness campaign;No news platform;;Thu, 25 Oct 2018 12:58:06 PST;article; One of the promoted posts about cybersafety and security Leading Philippine telecommunication company Globe Telecom and Wattpad, the global multiplatform entertainment company for original stories, have joined hands to promote proper online behavior and responsible internet usage among the youth to keep them safe from numerous threats present in the internet—from viruses and other malicious software to cyberbullying and sexual exploitation, to name a few.  Wattpad now reaches more than seven million people in the Philippines, with Millennial and GenZ users making up more than 80% of its audience.  As home to the right demographic for its #makeITsafePH cyberwellness campaign, Globe saw Wattpad as a promising platform to reach out to the sector that is most susceptible to negative aspects of the internet. Wattpad has built a community and technology that taps into the people’s shared desire for stories and has seen continues growth in the Philippines, its second largest market. Filipinos  spend some 400 million minutes reading Wattpad stories each month while Filipino writers have shared more than 24 million story uploads on Wattpad.  “As we promote the benefits of digitalization, we also want to instill awareness among our customers especially the youth about new issues to understand and address.  These include unethical data mining, fake news, weaponizing social media, and unethical online behavior among others,” said Yoly Crisanto, Globe Senior Vice President for Corporate Communications. “For millions of people in the Philippines and around the world, Wattpad is a home away from home, where they can express their true selves in a safe, supportive environment. From anti-bullying to body-positivity, we see Wattpadders come together every day to promote and share positive, inspiring messages. We’re thrilled to be part of the #makeITsafePH campaign and work with Globe Telecom to help support the safety of young people online,” said Chris Stefanyk, Head of Brand Partnerships, Wattpad.  The #makeITsafePH campaign takes off from earlier Globe efforts to promote online vigilance among the public and protect them from becoming victims of online hacking, identity theft and other cybercrimes.  Various studies show that a significant number of Filipino youth have fallen victim to online abuse or crime which caused emotional, mental, or physical harm. For instance, the public-private-civic-academic coalition DQ Institute said last year that 73% of young Filipinos were exposed to at least one cyber risk specifically cyber bullying, online sexual behavior, and meeting with cyber friends, among others. This collaborates a report from the Department of Justice that many teenagers and younger children are exploited by the growing cybersex trafficking trade with at least 3,000 reports being received by the Philippines per month from other countries. Likewise, a 2015 survey by child-care nonprofit organization Stairway Foundation Inc. said that 80% of teenagers aged 13-16 in the country have experienced social media cyberbullying such as photo editing, humiliation, threats, exposure of secret conversations, and impersonation among other things.  Other cybercrimes that have to be addressed according to the Philippine National Police report in 2016 are online scams, online libel, identity theft, and violations of the anti-photo and video voyeurism act. Cybersecurity company Kaspersky Lab also ranked the Philippines 9th in the world in terms of volume of online attacks during the second quarter of the year with 10.6 million malware infections to take control of computers and capture private information.  Over 34.6% of these attacks were targeted against home users.

133;OVAC;ANOTHER YOUNG MOTHER ARRESTED;No news platform;No Author;Sat, 23 Jun 2018 22:38:04 PST;No news type;CYBERPORNOGRAPHY TRADE IN CORDOVA It was just two years ago when Miriam (not her real name) gave birth to her second son. Without any means of income, the then 20-year-old mother decided to venture into a “home-based enterprise” that would give her enough money to provide for her family. “Pobre man mi. Wala mi laing panginabuhian (We are poor. We don’t have any other means of livelihood),” she told authorities.  That home-based enterprise turned out to be cyberpornography. Miriam, now 22, was arrested yesterday by police operatives for allegedly exposing children to cyberpornography in Barangay Poblacion of Cordova town on Mactan Island, particularly for asking children to do live sex shows online in exchange for P3,000. Three girls — two of whom are both 12 years old and the other 15 years old — were rescued during the entrapment operation conducted at around 10 a.m. by the Anti-Cybercrime Group in Central Visayas (ACG-7) and the Cebu Provincial Police Office. A 4-year-old girl and Miriam’s two sons, ages 2 and 5, although were not offered during the transaction, were also taken in custody by social workers for assessment to determine if they were sexually abused as well. Police were preparing charges against Miriam for alleged violations of Republic Act 9208 or the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act and Republic Act 9775 or the Anti-Child Pornography Act in relation to the Cybercrime Prevention Act. Investigators were also considering the filing of the same charges against Miriam’s live-in partner who may have been her cohort in operating the cyberpornography business. Since the victims were minors, the offense falls under qualified trafficking, a non-bailable offense, which carries the penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of not less than P2 million. While the law against human trafficking allows the media to identify the accused, Cebu Daily News is withholding the real name of Miriam, who became a mother to her firstborn at age 17, to protect the identities of the victims and her two children. Case buildup Chief Insp. Leo Dofiles, chief of the Anti-Cybercrime Group (ACG-7), said it took them two months to conduct surveillance operations against Miriam. “We received an information that she has been involved in cyberpornography operations with the use of cellphones. So we conducted a case buildup to validate the report,” he said. On Saturday, an undercover policeman transacted with Miriam who allegedly acceded to the request to sexually exploit three minors in exchange for P3,000. Before she could start the sexual act, operatives immediately barged into her house and arrested her. Police seized from her two cellular phones, which will undergo examination to determine its contents and possibly trace her clients. “We didn’t have to wait for the suspect to sexually abuse the victims. Mere offering of minors (for cyberpornography) is already a violation,” Dofiles said. Never a harmless crime Cybersex is a billion-dollar global industry that proliferates with easy access to the internet. Based on a report from the International Justice Mission (IJM), a non-governmental organization that has been actively fighting all forms of human trafficking and child exploitation, majority of the customers of child pornography are located in the US, Europe, Australia, Japan, and South Korea. For a live video feed of young girls and boys, customers either pay through their credit card or via a money transfer service to directly pay the cyberporn operators. Lawyer John Tanagho, field office director of IJM-Cebu, said the state of online sexual exploitation of children, otherwise known as cyberpornography, is very disturbing. “This case refutes the myth that online sexual exploitation is supposedly a ‘harmless crime’ where children are shown ‘naked.’ Stripping children naked for online pedophiles is traumatizing enough. But online sexual exploitation or ‘cyberpornography’ is so much more,” he said in a press statement. Based on their records, over 50 percent of the rescued victims in the Philippines were just 12 years old or younger. Some, he said, were even babies and toddlers. Tanagho said sex predators usually pay between P1,000 to P5,000 for every “live stream” of the sexual act, hence some people are easily enticed by money without having to work hard. He expressed hope that cyberpornography will stop. “Let’s end online sexual exploitation of children together sooner than later,” he said. Cyberporn hotspot Miriam is currently under the custody of the ACG-7 but will subsequently be detained at the Cordova Police Station. Cordova, a third class municipality on Mactan Island, has been identified by law enforcers as a “hotspot” for home-based cyberpornography. Dofiles appealed to those who still engage in cyberpornography to stop their illegal and immoral business. “Poverty is not a reason for anyone to engage in something bad. Many poor families make a living by taking decent jobs,” he said. “I believe those who are into this kind of job simply want easy money,” he added. Dofiles said there will be no let up in their campaign against cyberpornography. “We shall continue to do our mission. If we won’t be able to stop it, at least, we will be able to minimize it,” he said. Worst crime to commit The rescued children were turned over to the custody of the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) where they will receive psychosocial interventions, including therapy and rehabilitation. As of May 2018, IJM has supported Philippine law enforcement agencies in operations that led to the arrest of more than 100 cyberpornography suspects and the rescue of more than 300 victims. At least 35 accused have already been convicted for trafficking children into online sexual exploitation. In an earlier interview, Cebu Vice Gov. Agnes Magpale, co-chairperson of the Provincial Women’s Commission, said the government will step up its campaign against cyberpornography and other forms of human trafficking especially because some people do not fear going to jail or getting arrested for exploiting children. “It’s the worst crime you can commit. This has been alarming because we see the damage it does to children. Can you imagine how some mothers could do this to their children? They know very well that cases were already filed against persons who abused children but they don’t seem to be afraid,” she said. Magpale appealed to parents engaged in this kind of practice, saying that poverty is not an excuse to engage in cyberpornography. “Remember, money earned through this illegal trade is just passing. Don’t use easy money in exchange for your children’s future,” she said. /WITH REPORTS FROM BENJIE B.

Joy (not her real name) was sentenced to 15 years in jail by the Cebu City Regional Trial Court Branch 11. She pleaded guilty to attempted trafficking in persons before Presiding Judge Ramon Daomilas on April 3, 2019.  The suspect was also ordered to pay P1,150,000 in fines and damages, according to a statement issued by the International Justice Mission (IJM).  Operatives from the Women and Children Protection Center – Visayas Field Unit caught Joy last May 2018 in the act of offering online predators to stream sexual explicit acts of her then 14-year-old daughter in exchange for money.   Lawyer John Tanagho, IJM – Cebu Field Office Director, lauded the outcome of the trial.  “Today’s conviction reflects excellent investigation by WCPC and prosecution by DOJ. This leads to timely justice for survivors and protects child victims from having to testify in court to their abuse,” Tanagho said. /bmjo;No news category;No Tags;https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/226445/san-fernando-trafficker-sentenced-to-15-years-in-prison;20
197;OVAC;Norwegian jailed for ordering online child sex abuse in Philippines;Agence France-Presse;Agence France-Presse;Tue, 15 Jan 2019 07:00:13 PST;article;INQUIRER.net stock image OSLO, Norway – A 71-year-old Norwegian man was sentenced to 12.5 years in prison on Monday for ordering sexual assaults to be carried out online against dozens of young Filipinas. “With his actions, the accused contributed to a sex industry that brutally exploits vulnerable children in the worst possible way,” the Sore Sunnmore district court in western Norway wrote in its verdict.  Between 2012 and 2013, the man used an online video calling service to contact people in the Philippines. He paid them to, under his instructions, sexually assault minors under the age of 14, the youngest one “probably between three and five years old”, while he watched, the court found.  The court said there were “at least” 48 victims but the actual number could be much higher because of difficulties identifying them. “The court finds that the victims are living in an almost inhumane situation that the accused helped perpetuate with his actions,” the verdict said.  Norwegian police were alerted by the United States FBI as part of a larger case the latter was probing.  Investigators found more than 36,000 photographs and videos containing child pornography in his possession. “I went into a bubble and I was going through a very difficult time in my personal life,” the accused told the court during his trial, according to broadcaster NRK. The sentence handed down was slightly higher than the 12 years the prosecution had called for. The victims’ young age was considered an aggravating factor for the sentencing. /cbb ;Europe;['child sex abuse', 'Features', 'Norway', 'online sex abuse', 'Philippines'];https://globalnation.inquirer.net/172490/norwegian-jailed-for-ordering-online-child-sex-abuse-in-philippines;1
198;OVAC;Aussie-funded project needs sex offenders’ registry in PH;Philippine Daily Inquirer;DJ Yap;Sat, 21 Nov 2015 03:38:36 PST;article;"The creation of a registry of sex offenders known to have preyed on children will be one of the components of an Australia-funded project to combat child trafficking in the Philippines. Australia will request the Philippine Congress to enact a law creating such a registry as part of its P66-million program on child protection against sexual abuse and exploitation, Australian Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop said on Tuesday.  Bishop led the launch of the three-year project, which is seen to boost the Philippines’ capability to monitor the activities of foreign pedophiles, and at the same time warn communities that a sexual predator may be within their midst. “Child sexual abuse and exploitation is an aberrant crime. It is a serious social issue that is not confined to the Philippines. All countries are affected by this, including Australia,” Bishop said at the launch of the program in Makati.  “The existence of these crimes has intensified by virtue of technology and social media,” she said, adding that the issue was compounded by the fact that some parents in impoverished communities were complicit. The officials who attended the event included Justice Secretary Alfredo Benjamin Caguioa and Social Welfare Secretary Corazon Soliman who both expressed their support for the Australian initiative.  Bishop said the program will also ensure that Philippine authorities would have the training to deal with the serious criminal issue, aligned with other Australia initiatives on transnational crime, including human trafficking and money laundering.  3-pronged approach The program, which will run from July this year to June 2018, adopts a three-pronged approach: protection of children against online sexual abuse and exploitation, prosecution of offenders and delivery of justice to victims, and promotion of children’s rights to a safe and secure online environment. The program components are the following: Drafting and advocating for the passage of a Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act;  Advocating child-friendly rules in family courts; Establishment of community-based multi-sector and local task forces in selected pilot areas to serve as Child Protection Quick Reaction Teams; Legal audit of online child sexual abuse cases in courts through the National Family Courts Summit conducted in September; Drafting of a communications strategy, public information and education campaign on the rights of children against online sexual abuse and exploitation, and Multi-sector training of justice system actors. The wiretapping of sexual offenders could be part of this effort to protect children from sexual predators, said Bishop who was in the Philippines to attend the recently concluded Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Ministerial Meeting, and to deliver Australia’s statement addressing “Inclusive Growth Through Sustainable and Resilient Communities.” The P66-million program is in coordination with The Asia Foundation and seeks to bring together public and private resources to support efforts of the Philippine government to protect children particularly from online abuse and exploitation. Its private sector partners are Telstra, ANZ Bank and QBE Insurance Group. Innocence lost “This program is about caring for children whose innocence is lost, children who are victimized because of poverty, children whose own parents bring them into this kind of hideous situation,” Soliman said. She cited instances when children were encouraged by their own parents to perform lewd acts online for money, thinking that no harm was being done, as no physical touching was involved.

 But little do the parents know that their children’s “souls are being destroyed,” Soliman said. With the sex offender registry mechanism, she said communities could know in advance that they were being “targeted” and thus could take steps to protect their children. “That can help us in ensuring that prosecution will happen,” Soliman said. She said the registry would go a long way in helping the authorities monitor convicted child abusers in the country. Australia, along with European countries, is one of the nations whose citizens are known to visit the Philippines for sex, Soliman said in the interview. Paul Hopkins of the Australian Federal Police cited Australia’s own “Child Offenses Register,” which requires certain sexual offenders to report their whereabouts and activities to the police.";;['Child Sexual Abuse', 'Child Trafficking', 'Corazon Soliman', 'Julie Bishop', 'Sex Offenders', 'Sexual Abuse', 'Sexual Exploitation'];http://globalnation.inquirer.net/132529/aussie-funded-project-needs-sex-offenders-registry-in-ph;1
199;OVAC;PNP to boost campaign vs online women, children sexual abuse;INQUIRER.net;Consuelo Marquez;Sat, 13 Jun 2020 15:42:37 PST;article;MANILA, Philippines — The Philippine National Police (PNP) on Saturday said it would boost its campaign against perpetrators of online sexual exploitation of women and children. PNP chief Gen. Archie Gamboa has ordered the PNP-Directorate for Information and Communication Technology Management (DICTM) to connect the PNP National Headquarters and the 17 police regional offices nationwide by putting up “One Network” that will serve as a “main highway that has audio, video, and data communication” for easier exchange of information and facilitate tracing of cybercriminals.  “Go after cybercriminals, especially those who prey on women and children,” he said in a statement. Gamboa also noted that they will work with their foreign counterparts to track down foreign cybercriminals involved in online child abuse.  According to PNP, cases of violence against women and children decreased by 44.7 percent from 6,689 cases reported from January 1 to March 16 to 3,699 cases logged from March 17 to June 4. In spite of this decrease, however, Gamboa said PNP should be fully prepared in pursuing criminals online.  Gamboa then encouraged the public to report incidents of online sexual abuse by contacting the PNP Women and Children’s Protection Center (WCPC) Hotline: 0919-777-7377 or (02) 8723-0401 local 5261.

200;OVAC;Not every home is safe for kids;Philippine Daily Inquirer;Philippine Daily Inquirer;Wed, 12 Aug 2020 04:01:14 PST;article;"How we live and engage through physical distancing and self-quarantining during this pandemic have inevitably created a new normal, with obvious disruptions occurring in our very own homes. This crisis is a difficult time for families, especially for children, the most vulnerable citizens. While quarantine has been deemed necessary to avoid spreading the virus and ensure safety for everyone, we need to remember that the home may not be a safe space to all. Alongside women, children are most susceptible to abuse and violence especially during this time of pandemic. With lockdowns, children with abusive parents are at greater risk of domestic violence, psychological abuse, and sexual assault and have nowhere to go. Lockdowns have also created a perfect setting for sexual traffickers to exploit our children online. Child sex exploitation has risen to epidemic levels since the pandemic. Under economic stress, some parents have resorted to selling inappropriate images or videos of their kids, while some others neglect to protect and watch over their children as they spend more time online on different social media platforms, leaving them at risk of being preyed on by online sexual predators and pedophiles.  As citizens, we have to understand that while there are existing laws meant to protect and ensure the security of our children—among them the Anti-Violence Against Women and Their Children Act, Anti-Rape Law, Anti-Photo and Video Voyeurism Act, Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act, and the Safe Spaces Act—we need to act and do our critical part for the community by helping victims of abuse. Most of the time, immediate intervention from police and local government units is limited, and victims refuse to report such cases of abuse and violence as they feel powerless to do so or are trying to protect loved ones. Children trapped in a home with violent, abusive parents or guardians need help from those around them. Check on a child who is in a home flagged as abusive, and do not hesitate to report to authorities. Now more than ever, we need our government and our community to urgently respond with a united effort to protect children from the risk of violence, exploitation, and abuse as part of our broader response to the pandemic. Because home should be a safe place for our children to grow and learn, not a place that causes trauma and anxiety.  Richelle Ann Buan

201;OVAC;German police raid 50 homes in child porn investigation;Associated Press;Associated Press;Wed, 02 Sep 2020 19:42:14 PST;article;BERLIN — A thousand police officers in Germany raided the homes of 50 people as part of a nationwide crackdown on the online sharing and distribution of child pornography, Cologne police said Wednesday. None of the 48 men and two women suspected of involvement was arrested during Tuesday’s raids, but investigators seized around 2,000 phones, computers, and other devices upon which images were stored, police said.  The suspects are accused of sharing images of child sexual abuse through networks such as social media and messenger services, Michael Esser, director of criminal investigations for the Cologne police, said. None of them are suspected of directly abusing any children, according to the current state of the investigation. “Behind every picture, there is a victim of sexual abuse,” Esser said. “We will never give up the fight against pedophile criminals.”  A map of Germany shows the number of raid places at a press conference at the police department in Cologne, Germany, about nationwide child pornography raids, Wednesday, Sept. 2, 2020. Special police units, coordinated by the Cologne Prosecutor’s Office, have raided 60 places across Germany yesterday, linked to an ongoing investigation that started last year in the city of Bergisch Gladbach. (AP Photo/Martin Meissner) The suspects present a cross-section of society, young and old, single and married, Cologne prosecutor Markus Hartmann said. The raids took place in 12 states, with a focus on Bavaria. They were part of an investigation that began in October 2019 and has so far identified 207 suspects.  “What’s important is that we are seeing a new kind of crime,” Esser said. “The perpetrators are not acting on their own, but are part of bigger networks which are using the structures of online communication.” Police received a lot of support in their investigation from one specific messenger service operator, Esser said He declined to say which one. Investigators are looking quickly through the seized images to see if they can find evidence indicating that children are still being abused and if so, they will try to find and rescue the victims. ;World;['child abuse', 'child porn', 'child sex abuse', 'Children', 'Crime', 'Germany', 'online sexual abuse', 'pedophiles', 'porn', 'Pornography', 'trafficking'];https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1330443/german-police-raid-50-homes-in-child-porn-investigation;3
202;OVAC;Aussie sentenced to life term for online child porn;Philippine Daily Inquirer;Ador Vincent Mayol, Jigger Jerusalem;Fri, 15 Jun 2018 06:14:06 PST;article;"CONVICTED Australian Peter Gerard Scully (center) is escorted by policemen out of a courtroom in Cagayan de Oro City after his conviction for trafficking.—JIGGER JERUSALEM CAGAYAN DE ORO CITY — An Australian who ran an international cyberpornography trade was sentenced by a local court to life imprisonment for forcing children to perform sexual acts and for torturing them while filming their ordeal. Judge Jose Escobido of the Regional Trial Court Branch 37 here found Peter Gerard Scully, 55, guilty for qualified trafficking.  He was also given an additional six years to nine years and 11 months in jail for five counts of rape by sexual abuse. Testimonies  Scully’s former live-in partner, Filpino Carme Ann Alvarez, who allegedly lured female street children and young scavengers, was also meted the same penalty. Each of them was ordered to pay a fine of P5 million, P500,000 in moral damages and P100,000 in exemplary damages.  Escobido gave credence to the testimonies of two victims who escaped from Scully’s rented house here in 2014.  Merlynn Uy, officer in charge of the Regional Prosecutor’s Office in Northern Mindanao, considered Scully’s conviction a welcome relief. “This sends a strong message to the public in general that our laws do not look kindly on human traffickers,” she told the Inquirer. Uy lauded the prosecution led by government lawyers Ruby Malanog and Charisse Bitoon. “There’s no let up in our campaign to prevent, if not eliminate, human trafficking in all regions in the country,” she said.  Scully did not issue any statement after the court handed its decision. He and another partner, Liezyl Margallo, are facing at least 50 other qualified trafficking cases in Cagayan de Oro and Surigao cities and the Bukidnon province. National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) agents arrested Margallo on Malapascua Island in Daanbantayan town, Cebu province, in January 2017. Scully, Margallo, and Alvarez reportedly conspired in enticing poor children to go with them. A video footage provided by the Dutch police showed a naked 1-year-old girl who was hung upside down with her hands tied and legs drawn apart.   ‘Worst video’ The girl, known in the footage as “Daisy,” was crying nonstop while being tortured and sexually assaulted by a masked older girl later identified as Margallo. The footage, described by the NBI as the “worst video” they had seen in their years of campaign against child pornography, used at least nine children, including a 12-year-old girl, whose remains were exhumed in Scully’s apartment at Villa Corito in Surigao City. Uy said the two victims, aged 10 and 13, gave a detailed narration of the ordeal they suffered under the hands of Scully when they were detained in the foreigner’s house in Cagayan de Oro from Sept. 19 to 23 in 2014.

 Scully was arrested by NBI agents at Malaybalay City in Bukidnon in February 2015. Uy said eight other victims, aged 1 to 12 years old, were rescued in 2015.";;['child abuse', 'Cyberpornography', 'Life Imprisonment', 'Peter Gerard Scully', 'Trafficking'];https://globalnation.inquirer.net/167903/aussie-sentenced-life-term-online-child-porn;4
203;OVAC;PH, US sign agreement vs child trafficking, abuse;INQUIRER.net;Tetch Torres-Tupas;Tue, 11 Apr 2017 17:43:33 PST;article;[ventuno id=’OTE5MzA1fHwyMzY4fHwxMDg2fHwxLDIsMQ==’][/ventuno] The Philippines and the US government on Tuesday signed an agreement to enhance the campaign against child trafficking and abuse in the country.  Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II, chair of the Inter-Agency Council Against Trafficking, and Chargé d’Affaires Michael Klecheski of the US Embassy in Manila signed the Child Protection Compact (CPC) which aims to stop online sexual exploitation of children (OSEC) and child labor trafficking (CLT). In the deal, US$3.5 million or around P175-million funding will be provided by the US Department of State’s Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons (TIP) to non-governmental or international organizations that would combat OSEC and CLT.  From the said fund, $3 million will be allocated to support capacity-building related to improving Philippines’ response to OSEC while the remaining $500,000 will be used to support activities related to Philippines’ response to CLT The IACAT, on the other hand, will provide P40 million to fund its projects related to the program.  Through the CPC, the two governments aim to increase the number of victims-centered investigations, prosecutions, and convictions of OSEC and CLT cases, strengthen government’s and civil society’s capacities to identify and provide comprehensive services for victims, and also strengthen existing community-based mechanisms for identifying and protecting child victims of OSEC and CLT.  “The evil of human trafficking should be fought on all fronts. We should channel our collective efforts towards eradicating it. Anything that debases or dehumanizes the dignity of a person is an abomination that must end. Slavery and exploitation has no place in any society. Any act that which enslaves or exploits our children magnifies the evil a hundredfold,” Aguirre stressed during the signing of the deal. “Let us not leave no stone unturned in our avowed purpose to protect our children. Let us send a message, a strong one at that. Hurt our children, and we will come after you. And you will not like it,” he warned. “Let us invest in our children. They are our hope. They are our future… Anything that debases or inhumanizes the dignity of a person is an abomination that must end,” said Michael S. Klacheski, US Chargé d’ Affaires said. Both enhanced strategies against OSEC and CLT will be piloted in two regions, namely: the National Capital Region (NCR) and Central Visayas (Region 7).  Other Philippine government agencies involved in the said contract are the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE), Department of Justice (DOJ), Bureau of Immigration (BI), Philippine National Police (PNP), National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) and the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG).

206;OVAC;Wisconsin man pleads guilty to producing child porn in PH;INQUIRER.net US Bureau;INQUIRER.net US Bureau;2019-03-22T16:08:40+00:00;article;WASHINGTON — A Wisconsin man pleaded guilty Tuesday, March 19 to producing and possessing child pornography in 2015, and engaging in illicit sexual conduct in a foreign place between 2014 and 2015. This guilty plea was announced by Assistant Attorney General Brian Benczkowski of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney Matthew D. Krueger of the Eastern District of Wisconsin.  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) is investigating this case with the cooperation of the Sheboygan (Wisconsin) Police Department. Jeffrey H. Ernisse Jeffrey H. Ernisse, 61, pleaded guilty before U.S. District Court Judge Lynn S. Adelman to two counts of producing child pornography, one count of engaging in illicit sexual conduct with a minor in the Philippines, and one count of possessing child pornography.  According to admissions made in connection with his guilty plea, while law enforcement was investigating Ernisse for producing child pornography in Wisconsin, they discovered evidence of additional child pornography production from the Philippines on Ernisse’s digital devices. While traveling in the Philippines in March 2015, and again in April 2015, Ernisse produced child pornography with a prepubescent minor.  Between June 2014 and April 2015, he engaged in illicit sexual conduct with a minor in the Philippines.  In December 2015, Ernisse possessed child pornography in the Eastern District of Wisconsin. This case was prosecuted by Trial Attorney William M. Grady of the Criminal Division’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (CEOS), and Assistant U.S. Attorney Megan J. Paulson of the Eastern District of Wisconsin. Ernisse’s sentencing is set for July 11, 2019. This investigation was conducted under HIS’s Operation Predator, an international initiative to protect children from sexual predators. Since the launch of Operation Predator in 2003, HSI has arrested more than 19,000 individuals for crimes against children, including the production and distribution of online child exploitation material, traveling overseas for sex with minors, and sex trafficking of children. In fiscal year 2018, more than 3,000 (3191) child predators were arrested by HSI special agents under this initiative and more than 850 (859) victims identified or rescued.;No news category;['child porn conviction', 'child sex abuse', 'Jeffrey H.

HSI PHOTO GARDEN CITY, New York —  Federal prosecutors on June 19 indicted a local man for traveling to the Philippines with intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct, sexual exploitation of a child, distribution of child pornography and possession of child pornography The charges against Thomas Blaha, 64,  followed an investigation by ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) New York and was filed with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York charges.  According to court filings, in September and October 2019, Blaha traveled from New York to the Philippines to engage in sexual activity with a 13-year-old female in exchange for money. Blaha also enticed the victim to produce sexually explicit images of herself and send them to him in exchange for money. In December 2019, search warrants were obtained in the Eastern District of New York for Blaha’s Facebook account as well as his residence in Garden City, New York and electronic devices. The searches revealed hundreds of images of children engaged in sexually explicit conduct.  If convicted, Blaha faces a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years imprisonment and up to 170 years imprisonment. “It’s alleged Blaha made trips to the Philippines to sexually abuse a 13-year old female who was being exploited for money,” said Peter C. Fitzhugh, special agent in charge of HSI New York. “Crimes involving the sexual exploitation of unwitting children are the most heinous and will not be tolerated, regardless of where the sexual acts occur. HSI is a global investigative agency, and with our resources and partnerships with the United States Attorney’s Office, we will stop at nothing to put an end to child victimization worldwide.”  “The defendant allegedly traveled halfway across the globe to sexually exploit a minor that he had enticed through Facebook and create child pornography,” stated United States Attorney, Richard P. Donoghue. “The Department of Justice is committed to protecting children from online predators by identifying such offenders and prosecuting them to the full extent of the law.” HSI says suspected child sexual exploitation or missing children may be reported to the 24-hour hotline, 1-800-THE-LOST.

221;OVAC;Asap!;Philippine Daily Inquirer;Philippine Daily Inquirer;Sun, 24 Aug 2014 00:30:40 PST;article;"Despite the fact that Filipinos traditionally highly treasure children in their midst, sexual abuse and exploitation of children tragically remain common in Philippine society. Adding to this poignant irony is that even as the clamor for greater vigilance against child abuse is spreading worldwide, incidents of rape and murder of children in both urban and rural settings in our country continue to be reported with seeming regularity, many of them perpetrated by those who are supposed to care for them. One of the most chilling perhaps was the rape-slay of 11-month-old Geraline Cortes in San Juan City; the infant’s violated body was left under a parked passenger jeepney. In another incident, at an evacuation camp in Zamboanga City, a 6-year-old girl was raped by her own grandfather. Last February, a 14-year-old girl was found dismembered in North Cotabato. The horrific killings and rapes are simply startling to fathom as handiworks of human beings.  But it gets even worse. Some are making money from this horror. The production of porn videos, featuring Filipino children (male and female), being offered to pedophiles online by their own parents no less, have become a profitable cottage industry. Earlier this month, a mother was arrested in Taguig City by the National Bureau of Investigation  for running a cybersex den and for using her own 10-year-old daughter in the trade. “They do not want me. My clients want young girls so I asked my daughter to do the show,” the mother said, claiming she needed to run the illicit business to pay the bills. In March, police arrested two women in Davao City for forcing their seven children—one as young as two years old—to perform sexual acts transmitted via the Internet for foreign clients. It turns the stomach to hear one investigating officer’s account about the women’s staple American client: “Sometimes he’d call them one by one. Sometimes, he’d call five of them at the same time. The children would stand in a corner, stark naked, waiting for who’s next.” Even more alarming, online video streaming of child pornography has been tracked in 31 of our country’s 81 provinces, with a BBC Special Report counting between 60,000 and 100,000 Filipino children-victims thus far.  This outrage has no place in a civilized, human community. Society can’t sit back and just watch with cold indifference as the list of victims grows longer. We therefore strongly support Sen. Miriam Defensor Santiago’s bill seeking to prevent sexual abuse of children or at least minimize their vulnerability to the crime. Santiago would have the children, from Kindergarten to Grade 8, armed with the information they need to prevent sexual abuse and exploitation. “The incidence of child sexual abuse, child sexual exploitation and child abduction can be reduced by raising awareness among young children of common dangers and warning signs, empowering children to better protect themselves from sexual predators, and teaching children how to obtain any necessary assistance or services,” Santiago stated in her bill’s explanatory note. This kind of preventive, classroom-based measure is not exactly new. Similar measures have taken hold in the United States.  After being raped by a neighbor and abused by a family member and threatened with harm if she squeaked, Illinois girl Erin Merryn chose to remain silent about her ordeal. But later finding courage to speak out, Merryn helped push a law that has been named after her—“Erin Merryn’s Law”—which requires sexual abuse awareness for students K-to-12 in her home state, an act replicated in 18 other states. New York State passed the law in April, with state Sen. David Valesky speaking strongly about the subject. “As a society, we must do whatever we can to prevent sexual abuse of children,” Valesky said. “Erin’s Law will require schools to add to existing curricula and provide children with age-appropriate information about ways to get help. By giving children a means to feel safe so they can speak up, we can get them out of horrible situations as well as catch and punish their abusers.”  By “raising awareness among young children of common dangers and warning signs” Santiago’s bill, to be sure, once enacted into law, can reduce child abuse, exploitation and abduction here. In a country where many are loath to discuss any aspect of sex in classrooms, Santiago’s bill is bound to raise a lot of eyebrows. But unless there is another way, the bill should become law, Asap!";Editorial;['children', 'crime', 'Editorial', 'internet', 'online', 'opinion', 'Rape'];https://opinion.inquirer.net/77780/asap/comment-page-1;10

Stephen Muldrow announced that a federal jury has found David Paul Lynch (56, Venice) guilty of eight counts of producing and attempting to produce child pornography, two counts of traveling with the intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct, one count of receiving child pornography, and one count of possessing child pornography. He faces a mandatory minimum penalty of 15 years, up to 30 years, in federal prison for each production count, up to 30 years’ imprisonment for each travel count, a mandatory minimum penalty of 5 years, up to 20 years, for receiving child pornography, and up to 10 years in prison for possessing child pornography. His sentencing hearing is scheduled for January 11, 2018. Lynch was indicted on January 26, 2017.  According to testimony and evidence presented at trial, Lynch traveled to the Philippines regularly between 2005 and 2016 to have sex with children and make recordings of the abuse. Prior to his trips, he communicated online with individuals in the Philippines in order to locate children to sexually exploit. Lynch produced child pornography of at least three Filipino children on these visits and also solicited child pornography via email of a fourth. He was arrested in San Francisco attempting to board a flight to the Philippines on December 30, 2016. During a simultaneous search of his home in Venice, Florida, FBI agents located dozens of self-produced images and videos of child pornography from his trips.  This case was investigated by the FBI, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations, the Sarasota Police Department, the Cape Coral Police Department, the Bradenton Police Department, and the Lee County Sheriff’s Office. It is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Jennifer L. Peresie and Eric K. Gerard. It is another case brought as part of Project Safe Childhood, a nationwide initiative launched in May 2006 by the Department of Justice to combat the growing epidemic of child sexual exploitation and abuse. Led by United States Attorneys’ Offices and the Criminal Division’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section, Project Safe Childhood marshals federal, state, and local resources to locate, apprehend, and prosecute individuals who sexually exploit children, and to identify and rescue victims.

233;OVAC;Mandaue cyberporn;No news platform;No Author;Tue, 30 May 2017 00:08:30 PST;No news type;"Her neighbors thought Rosalyn (not her real name) was only selling pastries online. Imagine their shock whenauthorities arrested her on Saturday for allegedly exposing her 15-year-old daughter tocyberpornography.(CDN PHOTO/LITO TECSON) Rosalyn (not her real name) was famous in Sitio Sampaguita, Barangay Opao in Mandaue City for operating a roadside sari-sari store and selling pastries online. Her relatives and neighbors were caught by surprise when they learned that the 54-year-old mother of two daughters was arrested by authorities last Saturday for allegedly exposing her 15-year-old daughter to cyberpornography. “Gawas sa iyang sari-sari store, ang among nahibaw-an mao lang nga namaligya na siya og leche flan, cakes ug cupcakes nga iya i-post online (Aside from running a sari-sari store, what we know was that she sold leche flan, cakes and cupcakes online),” said a relative who requested anonymity. She said they never had an idea that Rosalyn was exploiting her daughter to do online sex shows for foreign customers.  While the law on human trafficking allows the media to identify the suspect, Cebu Daily News has withheld the name of the mother in this case to protect the identity of her daughter. A neighbor said Rosalyn, her husband and two daughters have been living in a shanty located about 100 meters from the main road in Barangay Opao for several years now. But they spent most of their time on their roadside sari-sari store since their house didn’t have any power connection after failing to pay the bills five years ago. “Dugay naman na siya nagtinda-tinda diri. Nahibong na lang mi nga gidakop siya. Sa among pagkahibaw, dili na siya ingon ana (She has been selling goods here for a long time. We were just surprised when she was arrested. All we know was she did not engage in cyberpornography),” she said. Detection of cases of online sexual exploitation of children (Osec) remains to be a tough problem for law enforcement agencies and public officials, said Mandaue City Vice Mayor Carlo Fortuna. “Detection is really a challenge because even the social structure of the family, the family members support the activity of the mother or the daughter or the son,” he said in a press conference on Monday. Rosalyn has been locked up at the Police Station 1 in Mandaue City following the arrest made by the Anti-Cybercrime Group in Central Visayas (ACG-7) and the International Justice Mission (IJM). She made her 15-year-old daughter do a live sex show online inside their home in Barangay Opao to an Australian policeman who posed as an online client. Seized inside the suspect’s house were several smartphones and cell phones which would be subjected to digital forensic examination. Rosalyn would be charged with violations of the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act, or the Anti-Child Pornography Act in relation to the Cybercrime Prevention Act, and the Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act. If found guilty by the court, Rosalyn faces life imprisonment and a fine of P2 million to P5 million. Since the victim is her 15-year-old daughter, the offense falls under qualified trafficking — a non-bailable offense. Her daughter is now under the custody of the Department of Social Welfare and Development in Central Visayas. Rosalyn’s was the first case of Osec recorded in Mandaue City. But in this particular case, the mother has been doing this to her daughter for five or six years already. Fortuna said cyberpornography could still be addressed by government officials. One way to do so, he said, is to seek the help of third parties — teachers and friends, among others. “Most of the victims don’t want to continue the same kind of abuse. But they could not report to anyone easily because they cannot find someone they can easily trust,” he said. The city will be strengthening ties with officials from both public and private schools in the city in order to help report possible cases of Osec among their students. Fortuna said the communities will also play a vital role in detecting possible cases of Osec. “If you think there is something (wrong) going on, you can easily tell what’s happening in the family because of a sudden lifestyle change. They start buying iPhones. It’s a very lucrative profession or occupation,” he said. Another step being considered by Mandaue City is to pass an ordinance similar to that of Cordova town, which requires money remittance centers in the city to submit reports to the police or the city government if there are suspicious transactions between a sender from abroad and a receiver in the city. This may include several money remittance transactions between the sender and receiver within one day, or huge amounts of money being remitted. “One of the indicators of online child sexual pornography is the remittances from other countries to the supplier of online sex. Right now, we have agreed to come up with a legislation to strengthen our teeth in monitoring these activities so we can detect both the source and the supplier,” he said.
In a press statement, the IJM said the victim had long wanted her mother to be arrested. “When interviewed after rescue, the victim said she had been praying that the abuse would stop,” said Evelyn Pingul, IJM Communications, Mobilization and Advocacy director. She said the ACG-7 received a referral from the Australian Federal Police that the suspect had been repeatedly sexually exploiting her two daughters online by sending sexually explicit images to an Australian in exchange for money sent by the foreigner through a money transfer agency. Evidence gathered by the Queensland Police in Australia showed that Rosalyn began sending sexually explicit images of her youngest daughter when the latter was only 10 years old. One of Rosalyn’s clients, Stephen James Sheriff, was arrested in Australia and was convicted for soliciting and accessing child exploitative images. Sheriff was meted an imprisonment of three years — a light punishment for a grave offense, Pingul said. After finding sufficient evidence, Judge Jose Nathaniel Andal of the Regional Trial Court Branch 24 in Cebu City ordered the ACG-7 to search Rosalyn’s residence. In an interview, Rosalyn admitted that she knew Sheriff, claiming that the Australian convict was the boyfriend of her older daughter, who is 25 years old. “Nagsuporta man na siya sa akong anak nga iyaha pud nga uyab. Ang among gipadala niya mga pictures man kon naa may okasyon, dili kanang mga butanga (Sheriff has been financially supporting my daughter, who is his girlfriend. We sent photographs to him when there were occasions in our family, but not lewd photos),” she told CDN. Rosalyn insisted that the money was a gift, not payment. Rosalyn said she has not heard from Sheriff since a year ago.";No news category;No Tags;https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/134773/mandaue-cyberporn;13
234;OVAC;Mom nabbed for exposing young girls to cyberporn;No news platform;No Author;Wed, 29 Aug 2018 23:10:54 PST;No news type;POLICE arrested a 25-year-old mother for allegedly exposing her daughter and younger sister to cyberpornography in Minglanilla town, south of Cebu. Ivy, not her real name, was placed under the custody of the operatives of the Women and Children Protection Center-Visayas Field Unit (WCPC-VFU) following an entrapment operation on Tuesday. Her 4-year-old daughter and 15-year-old sister were rescued during the raid and are now with the Department of Social Welfare and Development in Central Visayas (DSWD-7) where they will receive psychosocial intervention, theraphy, and rehabilitation. In a press statement, the International Justice Mission (IJM) — an organization that actively campaigns and operates against online sexual exploitation of children — said authorities conducted surveillance operations against the suspect for several months after receiving reports regarding her illegal activities.  The IJM found out that the suspect has been transacting to online clients who paid her in exchange of lewd photographs and videos of the minors. Senior Supt. Romeo Perigo, WCPC-VFU chief, said there will be no let up in the campaign against online sexual exploitation of children. “We appeal to other people committing the same offenses to stop this illegal activity. If you continue, the police will find you and put you in jail,” he said. The suspect will be charged under Republic Act (RA) 9208 or the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act as amended by RA 10364, and RA 9775 or the Anti-Child Pornography Act in relation to RA 10175 or the Cybercrime Prevention Act. Regional State Prosecutor Fernando Gubalane said the law doesn’t exempt anyone, including parents who take advantage of their children’s vulnerability. “The quiet neighborhood and the walls will not stop us in our campaign against Trafficking in Persons,” he said. During the entrapment, Ivy offered to sexually abuse her daughter and livestream those acts to get money from a foreigner online. Lawyer John Tanagho, IJM field office director, lauded the police for the arrest. “Over time these operations send the message to traffickers that it’s too risky to abuse children. In fact, because the police have intensified their efforts against online sexual exploitation of children, more children will be safe from this violent and sick abuse, both now and in the future,” he said.;No news category;No Tags;https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/191638/mom-nabbed-exposing-young-girls-cyberporn;13
235;OVAC;Are there enough laws to curb child pornography in PH?;INQUIRER.net;Maila Ager;Tue, 22 Nov 2016 13:07:03 PST;article;Sen. Grace Poe. INQUIRER FILE PHOTO / GRIG C. MONTEGRANDE The reported continued proliferation of child pornography despite the existence of various laws penalizing it has prompted Senator Grace Poe to file a resolution urging the Senate to look into it. Poe, in filing Senate Resolution No. 237, noted that child pornography and prostitution still persist despite the enactment of various laws that carry penalties against unlawful acts such as Republic Act (RA) No. 7610 or the Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act of 1992, RA No. 9775 or the Anti-Child Pornography Act of 2009, and RA No. 10175 or the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012.  The senator said she was alarmed that the Philippines has been tagged by the United Nations Children’s Fund (Unicef) as the number one global source of child pornography and the “epicenter of the livestream sexual abuse trade,” with mostly poor families forcing their children to perform live sex online for pedophiles around the world in exchange for huge amounts of money. “Ang ulat na nangunguna ang Pilipinas sa child pornography ay talagang nakakabahala. Higit dapat bigyan ng proteksyon ng pamahalaan ang mga batang napupuwersang magtrabaho sa ganitong kalakaran,” Poe said in a statement on Tuesday.  (The report that Philippines tops child pornography cases is alarming. There is greater need for the government to protect children from engaging in this industry.) READ: NBI exec disputes Unicef data on PH child porn  She also cited reports that child pornography in the country is now considered a “billion-dollar business” as half of the 7,000 cybercrime-related incidents reported in the Philippines were allegedly related to child sex abuse. The average number of child porn cases in the country reportedly increased to 100 cases from January to February alone this year, from the average 50 cases from 2010 to 2014. Poe then urged the appropriate committee in the Senate to conduct an investigation “toward crafting remedial measures, amending existing laws and capacitating implementing agencies to make them more responsive in deterring and penalizing child pornography and prostitution.” “Kailangang magkaroon ng komprehensibong programa upang matigil na itong ganitong klaseng gawain (There must be a comprehensive program to make sure that this is stopped),” said the senator, who is also a child welfare advocate. Poe has filed Senate Bill No. 160 or the Libreng Pananghalian sa Pampublikong Paaralan that aims to provide free school feeding program for all public schools and SB No. 161 or the First 1,000 Days Act seeking to establish a natal care program for expectant mothers and health care and feeding program for toddlers.

Instead, a three-year-old boy was rescued by police from his mother Maria (not her real name), who was caught in the act of offering to sexually abuse her son and livestream the acts from her home in Sitio Kalachuchi, Barangay Looc in Lapu-Lapu City. The entrapment operation happened yesterday (February 26) a few minutes past 2 p.m. when most people were taking their afternoon rest. Niño (not his real name) is now under the protective custody of the Department of Social Welfare and Development Central Visayas (DSWD-7).  Senior Supt. Romeo Perigo, chief of the Women and Children’s Protection Center in Central Visayas (WCPC-7), said someone reported to them that Maria, 24, was involved in the Online Sexual Exploitation of Children (OSEC). Perigo said they started surveillance work last January 24 which led to the woman’s arrest yesterday. Other victims Aside from Niño, Perigo said it is also believed that the suspect has other victims, including a five-year-old girl, who was pictured in one of the explicit photographs. “We are doing our best to locate the others so we can rescue them. But we already checked the neighborhood but the people said they do not know the child in the pictures,” Perigo told Cebu Daily News. Perigo of WCPC-7 said this is the first entrapment operation that their office conducted in 2018. “These cases can happen anywhere as long as there is internet connection. Today, we are able to catch the suspect. She did not deny committing the acts,” said Perigo. Smart phones and money transfer receipts were found in the possession of the boy’s mother. This was pursuant to the implementation of a search warrant issued by Judge Ramon Daomilas Jr. of Regional Trial Court Branch 10 which was designated as a Cybercrime court. Lawyer John Tanagho, International Justice Mission (IJM) Cebu field office director, said the operation came two days after two operations in Biliran and Tacloban rescued 13 victims and arrested three suspects. “This is a reminder that there is much progress in the fight against OSEC and effective law enforcement can rescue and protect traumatized Filipino children across the country,” Tanagho said. Collaborative effort The entrapment operation was a collaborative effort of the Philippine National Police WCPC Visayas Field Unit, Lapu-Lapu City WCPC and Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT), Regional Anti-Cybercrime Group, DSWD-7 and IJM. IJM, in an official statement, said the suspect graphically described how she would sexually abuse her three-year-old son in exchange for money.
“Before the entrapment, the suspect even sent sexually explicit videos of very young children forced to perform sex acts on the suspect,” said IJM in an official statement. Police will file against the suspect criminal violations under RA 9208 or the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act, RA 9775 or the Anti-Child Pornography Act in relation to RA 10175 or the Cybercrime Prevention Act. IJM Philippines uncovered an increasing number of cases involving the online sexual exploitation of children (OSEC). Children as young as three months old are being exploited to produce illicit photographs, pornographic videos and customer-directed live sex shows for those residing overseas. Eighty-seven percent of the victims are minors. Of this percentage, 55% are 12 years old or younger. As of January 2018, IJM supported 76 rescue operations, rescued 268 victims, arrested 121 suspects and facilitated 20 convictions.

237;OVAC;101 suspects nabbed on charges of illegal pornography in Korea;The Korea Herald/Asia News Network;The Korea Herald/Asia News Network;Wed, 05 Dec 2018 15:30:33 PST;article;SEOUL — Over a hundred suspects have been arrested in Korea for making and distributing illegal film and child pornography, using overseas-based social media channels such as Tumblr and Twitter. Over a hundred suspects have been arrested for making and distributing illegal film and child pornography, using overseas-based social media channels such as Tumblr and Twitter, police said Tuesday.  According to the Cyber Security Team of Northern Gyeonggi Provincial Police Agency, 101 people were arrested on charges of violating the Act on the Protection of Children and Juveniles From Sexual Abuse. Of those, nine suspects were indicted via a special crackdown on cyber sexual assault that began in August. The illegal page owners operated by frequently switching between accounts as they were blocked by the social media companies.  The police crackdown on the distribution of pornographic materials on social media was prompted by concerns over the possible migration of such operations to overseas-based social media platforms following the enforcement of stricter regulations on online storage services here. “We will notify the National Tax Service to impose additional taxes on profits earned from illegal films and have the victims receive help from public services or counselling agencies,” a police official said. ;World;['Asia', 'Cybercrime', 'Pornography', 'Social Media', 'South korea'];https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1060243/101-suspects-nabbed-on-charges-of-illegal-pornography-in-korea;14
238;OVAC;"Mom pleads guilty to exposing her children, 4 others to cyberporn; gets 20 years";No news platform;No Author;Wed, 06 Jun 2018 22:33:38 PST;No news type;A 38-year-old mother will be spending the next 20 years in jail for selling her four children and four other minors to online pornography inside her home in Cordova town, Cebu, in 2016. Vilma (not her real name) was convicted of simple trafficking in persons after she pleaded guilty before Judge Mory Nueva of the Regional Trial Court Branch 13 on Wednesday. She was also ordered to pay a fine of P1 million, P100,000 in moral damages and P100,000 in exemplary damages. Vilma is the 14th person to be convicted for online sexual exploitation of children in the Philippines since January 2018, based on the records of the International Justice Mission (IJM), a non-governmental organization that has been actively fighting all forms of human trafficking and child exploitation.  While the law against human trafficking allows the media to identify the accused, Cebu Daily News has withheld her name to protect her children who were among the victims. Lawyer John Tanagho, field office director of the IJM-Cebu, was happy with the outcome of the case. “The lives of Filipino children are too precious to allow brutal sexual abuse and exploitation online to continue without accountability,” he said in a press statement. “A long prison sentence awaits people caught engaging in OSEC (online sexual exploitation of children),” he said. Tanagho said Vilma made a wise choice to plead guilty since she was able to reduce her sentence from a life imprisonment to 20 years in jail. A shorter sentence, he added, gave Vilma a chance to rehabilitate herself while at the same time, provide justice to the victims without having them to undergo a potentially re-traumatizing testimony. In a sworn affidavit, one of the victims described how Vilma forced her and the other children to perform sexual acts through live-streamed video in an abandoned store owned by the accused’s partner in Barangay Ibabao, Cordova town, in 2016. Based on the investigation, Vilma had abused the minors for several years for the pleasure of online pedophiles in Australia, the United States and Germany. The local police hatched an operation against the accused on Sept. 8, 2016 after receiving a tip from the Australian Federal Police. Senior Supt. Romeo Perigo, chief of the Women and Children’s Protection Center (WCPC)-Visayas Field Unit, said they were happy that justice was served for children abused by Vilma. “Today’s conviction brings closure to one of the cases on Trafficking in Persons that WCPC Visayas Field Office handled. It is a victory for the prosecution, arresting officers, IJM assisting lawyers, the four minor victims, the Department of Justice, the police, International Justice Mission and the Inter Agency Council Against Trafficking -Region 7. We are elated with pride and satisfaction,” he said. The victims remain under the custody of the Department of Social Welfare and Development where they are receiving psycho-social and rehabilitation services to overcome the years of abuse and trauma. Cordova Mayor Therese Sitoy-Cho also hailed the court’s ruling, saying it served as a lesson for others who were still engaged in the cyberpornography business. “It is frustrating to know that online sexual exploitation of children happens in our municipality, despite our vigilance. Thus, we are always grateful when these illegal activities get exposed and the people behind are caught and punished by the law,” she said. Cordova town on Mactan Island has been identified by law enforcers as a “hotspot” for home-based cyberporn. “And even if they are from Cordova, we will not condone their wrongdoing. We let the law deal with them. Let justice take its course,” Cho added.;No news category;No Tags;https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/178598/mom-pleads-guilty-exposing-children-4-others-cyberporn-gets-20-years;14
239;OVAC;Mother arrested for exposing daughter, other teenage girls to cyberpornography;Inquirer Visayas;Ador Mayol;Wed, 16 May 2018 20:41:37 PST;article;Police arrested a mother on Wednesday for allegedly exposing her daughter and other teenage girls to cyberpornography in Barangay Sangat, San Fernando town, 41 kilometers south of Cebu City. Her 15-year-old daughter and two other girls were rescued past 4 p.m.  Although the law against human-trafficking allows the media to identify the perpetrators, Cebu Daily News has withheld the name of the suspect in this case to protect her daughter. Lawyer John Tanagho, director of the International Justice Mission Cebu Field Office, said the recent operation was the sixth against those allegedly involved in an online sexual operation in Cebu since January 2018.  “This operation shows that Philippine law enforcement is able to track down and arrest individuals who sexually abuse children and sell ‘live-streams’ of that abuse to pedophiles around the world in exchange for money,” said Tanagho in a press statement. “If the community — whether teachers, neighbors, NGO workers, anyone — would provide tips or referrals to the police of so-called cyberpornography in their community, then more victimized and traumatized children could be rescued sooner before enduring years of abuse,” he added.  Charges for violating Republic Act RA 9208 or the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act and Republic Act 9775 or the Anti-Child Pornography Act in relation to the Cybercrime Prevention Act are being readied against the mother, which authorities estimate to be in her late 30s. Since the victims are minors, the case falls under qualified trafficking, a non-bailable offense. The Philippine National Police Women and Children Protection Center – Visayas Field Unit (WCPC-VFU) conducted surveillance operations against the suspect for about a month after they received reports that she was involved in cybersex operations. The suspect reportedly sends sexually explicit photos of minors, and later offers to sexually abuse the girls and live-stream it for men to watch online, according to the police. Authorities hatched an operation to arrest the mother.  Wednesday’s operation was done in coordination with the Cebu Provincial Women and Children’s Protection Desk (WCPD), Cebu Provincial Police Office’s Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) unit, Department of Social Welfare and Development Region (DSWD) and IJM, a global organization that fights human trafficking. The rescued victims were turned over to the DSWD for psychosocial interventions, including therapy and rehabilitation. As of April 2017, IJM has supported Philippine law enforcement agencies in operations against anti-online sexual exploitation of children, which has led to the arrest of 133 perpetrators and the rescue of 302 victims around the country since 2011.  Over 27 have been convicted. /ee;Regions;['Cebu', 'Crime', 'Cybercrime', 'cyberpornography', 'Human trafficking', 'Sexual abuse'];https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/991512/mother-arrested-for-exposing-daughter-other-teenage-girls-to-cyberpornography;14

Carsten Igor Rosenow, 55, went overseas on several occasions for sex with minors, some of whom claimed to be as young as 10, and filmed some of the sex acts, according to court documents, reports City News Service. Rosenow, who was convicted by a federal jury last summer of attempted sexual exploitation of a child and possession of child pornography, was also ordered to lifetime supervised release after his sentence is completed, and must pay a $100,000 fine and restitution to three victims.  The investigation into Rosenow’s activities began when the FBI was tipped off that he was communicating with underage girls over Facebook under the name “Carlos Senta,” according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office. He was arrested by federal agents at San Diego International Airport on June 21, 2017.  Investigators discovered videos of Rosenow having sex with minors on devices seized from his luggage. More videos were found following a search of his home, according to prosecutors. Rosenow, a former Chief Marketing Officer for tech company Illumina, Inc., testified that he was abroad in the Philippines for work and admitted having sex with girls he knew were underage. Prosecutors say he exchanged money, cell phones and chocolates with the girls for sex. “Sexual crimes against children are heinous and tragic wherever they occur, and we will not let borders keep us from protecting these vulnerable victims whenever possible,” U.S. Attorney Robert Brewer said. “The law allows us to pursue cases against U.S. citizens who victimize children around the world, and that’s what we’ve done here.

Cora (not her real name) has admitted to the crime during the arraignment of her case on Thursday, June 27, before Judge James Stewart Ramon Himalaloan of the Cebu City Regional Trial Court Branch 7.  She also pleaded guilty to a second charge on the possession of child pornography that was also filed against her. Her victims were five children aged six to 15-years -old, said a press statement from the International Justice Mission (IJM). The IJM statement says that Cora was arrested an entrapment operation by the National Bureau of Investigation – Anti-Human Trafficking Division (NBI-AHTRAD) on December 5, 2015 in her residence in Cordova town. NBI agents also rescued her five victims during their operation.  Judge Himalaloan ordered Cora’s imprisonment for 15 years for the crime of attempted trafficking in persons and ordered the her to pay P1.1 million in fine and damages. She was given another one to two months jail term and was asked to pay a fine of P50, 000 for her conviction on the possession of child pornography charge against her. “This conviction is yet another victory in our fight against online sexual exploitation of our children. But this fight is not only about jailing Filipino online traffickers. The global criminal justice system also needs to go after foreign predators who lure Filipinos with their money to feed their inhumane and pervert desires. The Philippine criminal justice system will be more victorious if demand countries are also able to put these foreign predators behind bars,” said Cordova Mayor Mary Therese Sitoy-Cho. IJM has so far supported 68 cases against persons convicted for the Online Sexual Exploitation of Children (OSEC), a violent and global form of human trafficking. OSEC typically involves a foreign online predator coming from a Western country and demanding sexually exploitative materials on children from Filipino online traffickers. They also partnered with law enforcement agencies in the arrest of 216 OSEC perpetrators and the rescue of 503 victims and children at-risk across the country.  Many foreign online offenders coming from the U.S., Canada, Australia, the UK and Europe, who pay for and direct the live-streamed abuse in OSEC, have also been arrested and convicted.

246;OVAC;Barbra Streisand apologizes for remarks on Michael Jackson accusers;Associated Press;;Sun, 24 Mar 2019 14:41:57 PST;article;NEW YORK  — Barbra Streisand apologized Saturday for her remarks about Michael Jackson and two men who have accused him of sexual abuse, saying that she should have chosen her words more carefully and that she admires the accusers for “speaking their truth.” In this Dec. 14, 1986, file photo, singers Barbra Streisand and Michael Jackson attend the Scopus Awards of the American Friends of the Hebrew University ceremony in Los Angeles. Image: AP Photo/Mark Avery, File Streisand had received bitter criticism online after she was quoted in The Times of London as saying that Jackson’s accusers were “thrilled to be there” during the alleged abuse, which “didn’t kill them.”  After an initial statement Saturday to The Associated Press in which she sought to clarify her remarks, the superstar of song, stage and screen posted an apology online that went further. “I am profoundly sorry for any pain or misunderstanding I caused by not choosing my words more carefully about Michael Jackson and his victims,” she wrote.  “I didn’t mean to dismiss the trauma these boys experienced in any way,” she wrote. “Like all survivors of sexual assault, they will have to carry this for the rest of their lives. I feel deep remorse and I hope that James and Wade know that I truly respect and admire them for speaking their truth.” The apology went far beyond the earlier statement to the AP, in which she elaborated on her published remarks, saying she felt “nothing but sympathy” for the men, Wade Robson and James Safechuck, who accuse the late star of molesting them as children.  She wrote in that earlier statement: “To be crystal clear, there is no situation or circumstance where it is OK for the innocence of children to be taken advantage of by anyone.” The remarks in question came deep into a wide-ranging interview with The Times. Asked about Jackson, Streisand was quoted as saying she “absolutely” believed Robson and Safechuck, who make their allegations in the recent HBO documentary “Leaving Neverland.” Jackson’s estate has condemned the HBO documentary. Jackson, who died in 2009, was found not guilty in 2005 of charges he molested a 13-year-old boy. Streisand was asked about the documentary, which she called “too painful.” She then said that Jackson, when she met him, was “very sweet, very childlike.” Asked how she reconciled that man with the one portrayed in the documentary, she replied: “His sexual needs were his sexual needs, coming from whatever childhood he has or whatever DNA he has. You can say ‘molested,’ but those children, as you heard say, they were thrilled to be there. They both married and they both have children, so it didn’t kill them.”  Among those firing back on social media was the director of “Leaving Neverland,” Dan Reed, who wrote of that last quote: “Did you really say that?!” Asked by The Times whether she was angry at Jackson, Streisand said: “It’s a combination of feelings. I feel bad for the children. I feel bad for him. I blame, I guess, the parents, who would allow their children to sleep with him.” Also attracting attention Saturday for remarks about Jackson was his close friend and mentor Diana Ross. “This is what’s on my heart this morning,” Ross wrote on Twitter. “I believe and trust that Michael Jackson was and is A magnificent incredible force to me and to many others.” NVG RELATED STORIES: Barbra Streisand draws flak over comment on Michael Jackson Fan attacks on alleged Jackson victims are ‘vile’, says docu director;Celebrities and Showbiz;['Barbra Streisand', 'child sex abuse', 'Leaving Neverland', 'Michael Jackson', 'sexual assault', 'sexual misconduct'];https://entertainment.inquirer.net/323082/barbrastreisand-apologizes-for-remarks-on-michael-jackson-accusers;15

The two women aged 23 and 33-years-old are also faced with a separate charge for the trafficking of children for the purpose of online exploitation filed against them before the Regional Trial Court in Talisay City. “After a full trial (and) if they are convicted, they will face life sentences,” said a press release from the International Justice Mission (IJM). The separate cases filed against the two women stemmed from operations made by the Philippine National Police (PNP) PNP Regional Anti-Cybercrime Unit, Region 7 (RACU-7) in 2017 and 2018 respectively.  The 23-year-old offender was arrested in an operation in Barangay Dumlog, Talisay City on October 27, 2017, the IJM statement said. During the operation, policemen rescued a 17-year old girl and an adult. Both were sisters of the accused, it added. Meanwhile, the 33-year-older offender was arrested in Barangay Cansojong on June 15, 2018. During that operation, eight minors aged 3 to 17-years-old were rescued and turned over to DSWD for assessment and rehabilitation. “Whenever the justice system holds accountable people who sexually abuse and exploit children, it actually prevents the abuse of other children by restraining those offenders and deterring other criminals. When the laws are enforced, the abuse of vulnerable children is dramatically reduced as impunity is replaced with accountability,” said International Justice Mission Cebu Field Office Director John Tanagho.;No news category;No Tags;https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/289697/two-women-sentenced-to-over-4-years-in-jail-for-the-sexual-exploitation-of-minors;15

CONTRIBUTED PHOTO/IJM A 17-year-old girl who allegedly facilitated online sexual exploitation was arrested by police operatives at Barangay Sambag Dos in Cebu City past 1 p.m. on Monday. Lindsey (not her real name), was nabbed in an operation conducted by the Women and Children Protection Center – Visayas Field Unit (WCPC-VFU) of the Police Regional Office in Central Visayas. She allegedly offered to sexually abuse three underage girls and transmitted pornographic images in exchange for money from her foreign customers online. Senior Supt. Romeo Perigo, WCPC-VFU chief, said that Lindsey had been under surveillance since April 2017 because of her link to an American national who was suspected of being engaged in cyber trafficking.  During the surveillance, Lindsey allegedly transmitted lewd images of herself and three other underage girls. A 14-year-old girl, one of Lindsey’s alleged victims, was rescued during the operation and is now under the protective custody of the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD-7). The operation was conducted in coordination with the Cebu City Police Office’s Women and Children Protection Desk (CCPO-WCPD), Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT), Inter-Agency Council against Trafficking (IACAT-7), and the International Justice Mission (IJM). “Transmitting any form of child pornography is equally illegal as creating and producing it. Once an image has been transmitted online, it can be redistributed anywhere in the world multiple times,” said lawyer Lucille Dejito, IJM-Cebu Director of LegalInterventions. Since Lindsey is still a minor, she will also be turned over to the Cebu City Department of Social Welfare and Services pending further investigation. Both of her parents are in jail for illegal drug charges, Lindsey told the police. If the police determines that Lindsey’s alleged involvement in cyber pornography was done with discernment, she will be charged with violation of the Anti-Child Pornography Act in relation to the Cybercrime Prevention Act. “It is unfortunate that a brutal crime such as online sexual exploitation of children can also be perpetrated by minors against other children,” said Dejito. “If determined to be acting with discernment, the suspect will have to face accountability and go through the proper interventions under the law, otherwise, she will continue to exploit children with impunity,” Dejito added. The crime carries a penalty of 20 years in prison. “To those who are engaging in online sexual exploitation of children, you should stop your illegal activity now because the WCPC Visayas Field Unit will catch and bring you to the court of law,”Perigo warned.;No news category;No Tags;https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/183653/minor-nabbed-alleged-online-porn;16

Romeo Perigo, chief of the Women and Children’s Protection Center in Central Visayas (WCPC-7), said a confidential informant tipped them off about the young mother’s illegal operations. “Based on our monitoring, she (mother) had been engaged in this kind of activity since the start of this year. It was not easy to catch her because she used her cell phone in taking photos and videos of her victims,” he told Cebu Daily News over the phone on Friday. Perigo said they transacted with the suspect who easily gave in to the demand of the undercover agent. The suspect allegedly asked P6,000 to P15,000 from her foreign patrons for a set of lewd photos and videos. Perigo, who led the operation last Thursday, said they were thinking that the suspect was communicating with them through online chat from her residence in Barangay Canjulao, Lapu-Lapu City. But when the operatives went to her house, she was nowhere to be found. The suspect’s daughter and 21-year-old neighbor Mia (not her real name) were left in the house. Mia told the police that the suspect produced and sent sexually explicit images of her to foreigners. Last Thursday’s operation was the sixth where children were rescued from online sexual exploitation. Complaints for violating the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act (Republic Act 9208) and the Anti-Child Pornography Act (Republic Act 9775 ) in relation to the Cybercrime Prevention Act (Republic Act 10175 ), among others, would be filed against the suspect at the Lapu-Lapu City Prosecutor’s Office. Since the offender is the parent and the victim is a minor, the offense falls under qualified trafficking — a non-bailable case. If convicted, the suspect could face life imprisonment and a fine of P2 million to P5 million. As part of due process, however, the suspect would be given the chance to submit her counter-affidavit and refute the allegations at the prosecutor’s office If there were sufficient evidence against her, charges would be elevated to the court. Otherwise, the case would be dismissed. “We have a record of our conversations with the suspect through chat. We don’t have to catch her in the act of exploiting her children. The mere fact that she agreed to exploit her children was enough evidence against her,” Perigo said. The two victims were entrusted to the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD). While the law against human trafficking allows the media to identify the accused, Cebu Daily News has withheld the name of the suspect to protect the identity of her daughter. Lawyer John Tanagho, Cebu office field director of the International Justice Mission (IJM) — a nongovernmental organization that has been actively fighting all forms of human trafficking — was saddened by yet another case of sexual exploitation involving parent and children. “Imagine, a mother offering to sexually abuse her 2-year-old daughter and even livestream that abuse?” he said in a press statement. “Online sexual exploitation of children is about individuals with distorted moral values who are willing to mistreat and sexually abuse children to make money, without regard for the God-given dignity and innocence of children,” he added. Tanagho said poverty should never be used as reason in engaging in online sexual exploitation. “We can’t blame this all on poverty. Millions of Filipinos work hard to provide for their families through honest and dignified means, even if they live simply,” he said. Senior Supt. Shiela Portento of the WCPC in Camp Crame said the public’s awareness about online sexual exploitation of children (OSEC) in the Philippines has slowly increased. “If we look into the situation of OSEC in the country based on the international reports, it is quite alarming. But as we see it on our perspective, we have already achieved remarkable accomplishments. Indeed, we cannot deny the existence or the proliferation of OSEC, but the PNP particularly the WCPC is doing its share to eliminate this type of crime,” she said. Regional State Prosecutor Fernando Gubalane lauded law enforcers and IJM for rescuing the two victims. “These people continued to fight against these illegal activities in the form of human trafficking,” he told Cebu Daily News. “It’s more difficult to fight online sexual exploitation now especially if it involves their own parents, and the illegal activity happening in the four corners of the house. But we’re trying our best to respond to the challenges,” he added. Since 2011, law enforcers raided home-based cyberporn businesses involving children in Cordova town and in Lapu-Lapu City, Cebu. In those raids, parents were arrested and charged with qualified human trafficking for exposing their children online to pedophiles for a fee. Gubalane, head of the Inter-Agency Council Against Trafficking (IACAT) in Central Visayas, said there would be no letup in their campaign against online exploitation and pornography. “Definitely, we will continue to go after violators,” he said.";No news category;No Tags;https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/147294/two-year-old-girl-rescued;16

An 18-year old woman was arrested with her live-in partner and his mother for their alleged cyber pornography business. (CDN PHOTO/JUNJIE MENDOZA) Sweetie 2.0 to be launched next year; 5 rescued kids in Cordova turned over to DSWD Dutch children’s rights organization Terre des Hommes is developing an advanced version of Sweetie, a computer-generated image posing as a 10-year-old Filipino girl in chat rooms, as part of the fight against online child abuse. Alwin de Leon, Terre des Hommes Philippines country director, said Sweetie 2.0 will be launched next year not to cause the arrest of more child offenders but to reduce the demand for minor victims of abuse online. “We have to deal with the demand. As long as there is demand, there will be supply. The main thrust of Sweetie 2.0 is to stop the crime before it actually takes place. It is one way to scare offenders and keep them from child pornography in the first place,” de Leon said during the “Ako Para sa Bata” international conference organized by the Child Protection Network last week.  Sweetie 2.0 is a chat robot that acts like she is following orders from child offenders online, doing sex acts for them while extracting their identities. The earlier version of Sweetie brought about the arrest of 1,000 child offenders. “It will be able to detect you as a person, all information coming from Skype, email, even Facebook can be retrieved. It can scan public chatrooms and will detect or zoom in to individuals searching for minor sex victims,” said de Leon. Such information will be sent to the international police. The chat robot can also take real time screen shots of the conversations. De Leon said repetitive “warning pop-ups” will be shown to everyone who wants to chat with Sweetie 2.0 for sexual play. “Many people are just curious and they go to a chat room, wanting to try to communicate with minors. This is to tell them that they should think twice or thrice before entering or to let them know that they are well-monitored,” said de Leon. RESCUED Five children were rescued last Saturday in barangay Cogon, Cordova from an 18-year-old mother who used her camera phone to take sex videos for male customers in the US. Emma Patalinghug, children’s welfare specialist of the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), said the five kids are under their custody. As of yesterday, no visitors were allowed to see the children. No immediate relatives went to the DSWD to claim the children. “Of course, we will follow the interventions which will be done after establishing relationship (with them). The incident is too fresh for them,” Patalinghug said. A 10-year-old girl was rescued from her aunt, 18-year-old Jaimie, while four other kids, aged 12 and below, were rescued from the mother of Jaimie’s live-in partner. Both Jaimie and the mother of her live-in partner were arrested while the boyfriend claimed he did not know anything about the cyber pornography business. Jaimie’s 10-year-old niece was posing naked for a sex video when National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) agents raided the house. FOCUS During the “Ako Para sa Bata” conference last week, de Leon of Terre des Hommes said Cebu is among the provinces that they are focused on because of the heavy influx of tourists here. “Some foreigners might be coming here to see the kids they have communicated with online,” he said. Terre des Homes has been partnering with non-government organizations in the Philippines to fight the rampant online child abuse. “We are here to spread the information about Sweetie 2.0, to prevent further offenders in victimizing minors online. We have to discourage them if we want to diminish the demand,” he said. De Leon was among the seven signatories who committed, at the end of the conference, to protect minors from online offenders.";No news category;No Tags;https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/77119/group-developing-advanced-chat-robot-vs-child-offenders;17
254;OVAC;Police arrest mother who uses daughter for cyberporn;No news platform;No Author;Wed, 16 May 2018 22:29:47 PST;No news type;POLICE arrested on Wednesday a mother who allegedly exposed her daughter and other teenage girls to cyberpornography in Barangay Sangat, San Fernando town, 41 kilometers south of Cebu City. Her 15-year-old daughter and two other girls were rescued past 4 p.m. of the same day. Although the law against human-trafficking allows the media to identify the perpetrators, Cebu Daily News has withheld the name of the suspect in this case to protect her daughter. Lawyer John Tanagho, director of the International Justice Mission Cebu Field Office, said the recent operation was the sixth against those allegedly involved in online sexual operations in Cebu since January 2018.  “This operation shows that Philippine law enforcement is able to track down and arrest individuals who sexually abuse children and sell ‘live-streams’ of that abuse to pedophiles around the world in exchange for money,” said Tanagho in a press statement. “If the community — whether teachers, neighbors, NGO workers, anyone — would provide tips or referrals to the police of so-called cyberpornography in their community, then more victimized and traumatized children could be rescued sooner before enduring years of abuse,” she added. Charges for violating Republic Act RA 9208 or the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act and Republic Act 9775 or the Anti-Child Pornography Act in relation to the Cybercrime Prevention Act are being readied against the mother who according to authorities could be in her late 30s. Since the victims are minors, the case falls under qualified trafficking, a non-bailable offense. The Philippine National Police Women and Children Protection Center – Visayas Field Unit (WCPC-VFU) conducted surveillance operations against the suspect for about a month after they received reports that the mother was involved in cybersex operations. The suspect, the police said, sent sexually explicit photos of minors, and later offered to sexually abuse the girls and live-stream it for men to watch online. Authorities hatched an operation to arrest the mother. Wednesday’s operation was done in coordination with the Cebu Provincial Women and Children’s Protection Desk (WCPD), Cebu Provincial Police Office’s Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) unit, Department of Social Welfare and Development in Central Visayas (DSWD-7) and IJM, a global organization that fights human trafficking. The rescued victims were turned over to DSWD for psychosocial interventions, including therapy and rehabilitation. As of April 2018, IJM has supported Philippine law enforcement agencies in operations against anti-online sexual expolitation of children leading to the arrest of 133 perpetrators and the rescue of 302 victims around the country since 2011. Over 27 accused have already been convicted for trafficking children into online sexual exploitation in the country.;No news category;No Tags;https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/175401/police-arrest-mother-uses-daughter-cyberporn;17

Police Colonel Gemma Vinluan, Cebu City Police Office chief, said that this would be one of her plans as the CCPO director as she also would want to address crimes against online sexual exploitation of children (OSEC), rape and human trafficking, aside from the illegal drugs problem. Vinluan, who was the former Women and Children’s Protection Center in Luzon chief, said that this was a way of addressing online sexual exploitation crimes, which she believed was alarming despite having no exact data yet about these crimes. She said she believed OSEC crimes were at an alarming level because this kind of crime would usually happen inside the house.  Read more: Rape cases among priorities of new Cebu City Police director She also said that most of the times, this crime would involve a family member of the victim, which would make it difficult for the victim to expose the exploiter. Vinluan said although her priorities now would be President Rodrigo Duterte’s war against drugs, she would never turn her back towards solving problems on violence against women and children. “Sad to say maraming previous operations na ang involved ay mag bata at nag-aaral sila (Sad to say there are previous operations that involved children and they are in school),” said Vinluan. She said setting up police help desks in or near schools would make it easier for victims to access police officers and to report their abusers and implement immediate arrests./dbs;No news category;No Tags;https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/245314/ccpo-to-set-up-help-desks-near-schools-to-address-osec-crimes;18

A proposed ordinance by Councilor Cynthia Cinco Remedio and Vice Mayor Carlo Fortuna has passed first reading in the Mandaue City Council. Remedio and Fortuna said that remittance systems, or money or value transfer businesses may be used as a conduit for illegal activities such as fraud and extortion, human trafficking and sexual exploitation, among others. “Enhancing measures to safeguard the rights of women and children is of paramount importance to combat child abuse and cyberpornography, it shall be made an obligation on the part of money transfer businesses to know their customers by requiring them to present accurate and pertinent information,” read the proposed ordinance.  The proposal came after Mandaue City saw its first ever reported case of Online Sexual Exploitation of Children (OSEC) last May. A mother was arrested after making her 15-year-old daughter do a live sex show online. While it was the first ever reported case, it was found out that the mother has been doing this to her daughter for five or six years already. Back then, Fortuna announced that among the city’s plans to combat OSEC cases is to pass this ordinance which is patterned from that of Cordova town. Under their proposed ordinance, money or value transfer businesses shall require their customers to present a valid Identification Card and to keep copies of customer references and identification for at least five years. They should also identify “suspicious transactions” and the beneficiaries to any possible extent.;No news category;No Tags;https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/137555/mandaue-dads-push-measure-vs-cyberporn;19
267;OVAC;Facebook says it removed 3.2 billion fake accounts in 6 months;Associated Press;Associated Press;Thu, 14 Nov 2019 07:36:17 PST;article;AP SAN FRANCISCO — Facebook says it removed 3.2 billion fake accounts from its service from April to September, up slightly from 3 billion in the previous six months. Nearly all of the bogus accounts were caught before they had a chance to become “active” users of the social network, so they are not counted in the user figures the company reports regularly. Facebook estimates that about 5% of its 2.45 billion user accounts are fake.  The company said in a report Wednesday that it also removed 18.5 million instances of child nudity and sexual exploitation from its main platform in the April-September period, up from 13 million in the previous six months. It says the increase was due to improvements in detection. In addition, Facebook said it removed 11.4 million instances of hate speech during the period, up from 7.5 million in the previous six months. The company says it is beginning to remove hate speech proactively, the way it does with some extremist content, child-exploitation and other material.  Facebook expanded the data it shares on its removal of terrorist propaganda. Its earlier reports only included data on al-Qaida, ISIS and their affiliates. The latest report shows Facebook detects material posted by non-ISIS or al-Qaida extremist groups at a lower rate than those two organizations. The report is Facebook’s fourth on standards enforcement and the first to include data from Instagram in areas such as child nudity, illicit firearm and drug sales, and terrorist propaganda. The company said it removed 1.3 million instances of child nudity and child sexual exploitation from Instagram during the reported period, much of it before people saw it. ;Social Media;['Child Abuse', 'Community Standards', 'extremism', 'Facebook', 'fake accounts', 'Nudity', 'sex'];https://technology.inquirer.net/92369/facebook-says-it-removed-3-2-billion-fake-accounts-in-6-months;19

This year’s theme, “Proteksyon ng Bata… Tungkulin ng Bawat Isa,” encourages parents and the community to be vigilant to stamp out child abuse. “Parents should be aware of some symptoms that an abused child display like experiencing depression, poor school performance, anxiety or may exhibit aggressive and self-destructive behavior,” said Grace Yana, Social Worker Focal on Children. “Sexual abuse often involves more than a single incident and could go on for months and years if not prevented,” Yana added.  “Teach the young children about the different parts of the body and tell them no one can touch their bodies if they don’t want possible abuse to happen,” Yana told parents about their role in protecting their children against abuse. Senior Insp. Marylou Cuizon of the Philippine Regional Office 7 said that parents should teach children to be responsible online. “Kids should avoid posting and e-mailing personal information like photos, birth dates and addresses to strangers who would lure them with money and other material things,” Cuizon added.;No news category;No Tags;https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/21617/dswd-marks-sexual-abuse-awareness-week;19
372;OVAC;Sex video: First test case for cyber law;Philippine Daily Inquirer;Christine O. Avendaño, Nancy C. Carvajal;Wed, 10 Oct 2012 05:36:49 PST;article;A 17-year-old girl may not get the help for now from authorities in her attempt to stop a  2-year-old sex video involving her that has gone viral on the Internet. Assistant Justice Secretary Geronimo Sy on Tuesday said the girl, who was not identified, was the first complainant under the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012.  Sy mentioned the case during a forum on the controversial law held at the Landbank building in Manila. And while he conceded the government for now could not do as much for her given that the law has yet to issue its implementing rules and regulations, efforts to help her case effectively was put on hold when the Supreme Court on Tuesday issued a temporary restraining order (TRO) on the law’s implementation.  Sy said that the “least” the Department of Justice (DOJ) could do now was to provide “restorative justice” to the girl, such as giving her counseling and a change of residence. Speaking to reporters, Sy said the girl sent an e-mail on her plea to Justice Secretary Leila de Lima on Oct.2. He said the department verified the e-mail and found it to be a “valid complaint.” He said the girl was 15 years old in the sex video.  “The least we can do for her  is not to watch the video,” Sy also said.  Under the new law, the government can request the websites that hosted the sex video “to have due respect with the rights of the child.” “She is a child after all,” he said. Sy said that it was the Internet service providers and the telecommunication sector that could stop the showing of the video. “The nature of cybercrime is, there is permanence in how data is being managed online, so it has  limited what we can do,” he said.  Case vs ‘hacktivists’ But Sy also disclosed that there was a case filed against the offender in this case. He conceded that the complaint was a “test case” for the government under the new cyberlaw. The National Bureau of Investigation on Tuesday also said the Supreme Court order  would hamper efforts against attackers of at least 15 government websites. Special investigator Joey Narciso of the NBI Computer Crimes Unit said that the suspended law had given the agency more powers to go against hackers. “Because of the TRO, the privileges were lost and we have to go back to the traditional way of investigating cases,” Narciso said. “We admit we are helpless without the Cybercrime Prevention Act,” he said. “The NBI has the talent but we are limited by provisions of the law and technology.”;Internet;['Cybercrime Prevention Act', 'DOJ', 'Internet', 'Sex Video', 'Supreme Court'];https://technology.inquirer.net/18672/sex-video-first-test-case-for-cyber-law/comment-page-2;23
374;OVAC;Philippine pair charged over animal torture videos;Agence France-Presse;Agence France-Presse;Tue, 26 Jul 2011 22:33:40 PST;article;MANILA, Philippines—A Philippine couple have been charged for making dozens of videos showing teenage girls torturing and killing animals, an animal rights group said Tuesday. The videos were sold via secretive Internet chat groups to people overseas who wanted to watch the footage for thrills, said Rochelle Regodon, Asia campaign manager for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA).  “The videos just tear your heart out. This disgustingly cruel enterprise must be stopped,” Regodon said at a news conference where some of the clips were screened. In the videos, girls wearing mini-skirts and high heels cut the ears off rabbits with scissors before being setting them on fire, burned a dog with a clothes iron and stood on puppies.  After PETA reported the crimes to authorities, police charged a husband and wife in the northern Philippines with animal cruelty, child abuse and human trafficking. But the couple fled before being arrested, and PETA said Tuesday it was offering a reward of P100,000 ($2,300) for information leading to their capture.  Regodon said clients overseas could look at excerpts of the so-called “crush” videos online, then order the full-length clips by sending a money transfer to the Philippine couple.  Prices ranged from $80 for one video to $200 for three clips, according to Regodon. She said the operation, which was believed to have existed for two years, was uncovered after someone in Russia contacted PETA with information about the videos. The Russian informant, who had infiltrated the chat groups where “crush video” fans gathered online, posed as a genuine customer, according to Regodon. The informant gained access to 68 short videos and enough information to help trace the organizers to the northern Philippine province of La Union.  Six girls aged between 12 and 18 had been coerced into the cruel acts after initially being lured to the couple’s home to work as babysitters, PETA said. While this was the first “crush” video case in the Philippines, there have been many cases in recent years of police raiding operations in which girls and women perform sex acts in front of cameras for overseas Internet clients.

375;OVAC;The secret life of Liezyl Margallo;No news platform;No Author;Sun, 29 Jan 2017 22:57:23 PST;No news type;"Suspected child trafficker, 23-year-old Liezyl Margallo was arrested, Wednesday on Malapascua Island, northern Cebu. The young lass was known to be kind, soft-spoken and generous to the people she befriended in Cebu. Little did they know that she kept a dark secret hidden in her past. The 23-year-old woman, tagged as “savage” by the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) for her alleged gruesome abuses against many children in Mindanao was “sweet and kind” when she lived the life of a fugitive for two years in Cebu until her arrest last week. Liezyl Castaña-Margallo, who went by the aliases Shannon and Gina Carpio, was living the high life here as she partied in bars along Mango Avenue with new-found friends in Cebu; and foot the bill each time. She offered them travels and had a passport under the name “Gina Carpio” to boot. She lived in an expensive condominium unit in uptown Cebu and kept a membership in one of the city’s posh gyms.  She spoke good English and looked confident. She even did her share of charity work, donating to causes and orphanages. A photo, provided by one of Margallo’s friends to CDN, showed the alleged child trafficker posing gleefully with friends as they were about to give out several packs of donation for World Food Day last October 16, 2016 through a Cebu-based charitable institution Margallo often donated to. Among her friends, she was well-liked and popular and thought to be beautiful inside and out.
Cool and collect, she was on top of the world. Until NBI agents swooped down on her strolling nonchalantly along the shores of Malapascua Island, northern Cebu while vacationing with two British nationals, Wednesday. The arrest came three months after 16 arrest warrants were issued against her by the Cagayan de Oro court. None of her friends, who are now trying to distance themselves from the horror of having once known her, could believe the news that sweet Shannon was in fact, a suspected sex predator who tortured children for years in Mindanao, as part of a lucrative cyberpornography business she run with her Australian boyfriend, arrested 53-year-old pedophile Peter Gerard Scully. One of her gym buddies in Cebu City (name withheld) posted an appeal on Facebook for people to stop judging Margallo’s friends in Cebu, as they too are victims of a woman who lied to them exceptionally well. An hour after making the appeal, the gym buddy deactivated her FB account, unable to take the stress of having to deal with a deluge of private messages from people judging her for her brief friendship with Margallo. Who would have thought that Margallo was involved in crime since she even visited the less fortunate and went with her to church, said her gym buddy. “Buotan pa kaayo ni siya visiting orphanage, attending feeding program for homeless people ug nagka kuyog pa me og church (She was so kind, visiting an orphanage, attending a feeding program for homeless people and even went with me to church),” the woman said on her post. The woman explained that she met Margallo who introduced herself as “Shannon” in the gym. “Didto me nag ka friends. Have no idea unsa og kinsa siya ug unsa ka yawa iyang gipang buhat (We met there and I had no idea what or who she was and the things that she did that were so evil),” the woman added. “Even other members in the gym are in shock of what she has done and her true identity,” the woman said. The woman also claimed that Margallo had walked in and out of the airport using a “fake identity.” Margallo was said to own a passport in 2015 under the name Gina Carpio. Screenshot of the public Facebook page of “Shannon Carpio.” Don’t judge Before deactivating her FB account, the woman decided to post on her wall some clarifications to address people’s questions. “I don’t want to ignore anyone but please understand my situation. I’m in total shock with what happened. Me and my friends who knew her are still trying to figure out how we can wake up from the terror she brought to our lives,” she said. The woman also apologized to her family for making friends with Margallo as she did not know her real identity and for introducing the suspected sex offender to her child. She explained that she never left her child alone with Margallo, not even for an instance. “Please undangi ko ug sige judge (stop judging me) because I’m the mother and my first instinct is to look after her and protect my child. One day you will know this when you’ll have your own kid, hopefully you’ll do better than me” she said. “To my family who’s been crucifying me for making friends with her and knowing her … I’m sorry I have no idea of her true identity, her past doing whatsoever,” she added. Victims too Another friend of Margallo also posted on her FB yesterday to stop telling them that they too were involved in whatever Margallo was into. “Clearly all Cebu friends are victims here. We don’t have any idea about her monstrous past. She make us believe of another identity like Shannon Carpio is the first name given by her real mother as she was adopted by her current mom now which (sic) renamed her GINA CARPIO,” the woman said on the post. Had they known of her past, the woman said, they would have been the ones to report Margallo to the NBI. But in her secret life, she was a “sweet and caring friend” who turned out to be really “good at hiding and lying.” “Understanding her past makes me angry, angry and disappointed. I really wish we never met her. If you people are the CEBU BLIND FRIENDS you won’t believe that you just had one FAKE FRIEND,” the woman added. “She even joined feeding program to children here in Cebu, who would have thought that she’s a monster,” she said. The woman continued on her post that to annoy Margallo’s friends in Cebu just adds insult to their injury. “Its all in the web just google it don’t make our lives miserable,” she added. Soft-spoken Margallo’s gym instructor, Luis Lagunay did not notice anything strange about “Shannon” for about a month that they were together. “Soft-spoken man to siya unya buotan man sad siya nako. (She was soft-spoken and was nice towards me),” said Lagunay who used to assist Margallo in the classy workout fitness center. Lagunay taught Margallo the basics of working out sometime in 2016, several months after she began her secret life in Cebu. From his jail cell at the Lumbia City Jail in Cagayan de Oro, Margallo’s boyfriend, Scully, reportedly financed Margallo’s lavish lifestyle in Cebu. Lagunay, like most of those contacted by Cebu Daily News, knew nothing of her dark past. “Igo ra gyud mi mag-training at least four days in a week. Wala man pud to siyay personal nga mga ipangsulti nako. (All I did was to train her four days in a week. She did not confide to me about her personal life),” he said. When he heard the news of her arrest for heinous crimes against young children, Lagunay was dumbfounded and could hardly believe it. “Na-shock gyud ko. Di ko katuo nga mabuhat na niya. (I was really shocked. I could not believe that she was capable of doing those things),” Lagunay said. He expressed hopes that the truth will come out and that justice will be served for the victims. Margallo and Scully, conspired to lure female street children and young scavengers (aged 1-12) into their fold and turned them into sex slaves. The children were all forced to perform appalling sexual acts and tortured. One of their victims was killed in the process. The two alleged sex predators sold gruesome videos of the torture – online – to pedophiles abroad charging $10,000 per view. Margallo and Scully are facing charges for violating Republic Act 9995 or the Anti-Photo and Video Voyeurism Act of 2009, and Republic Act 9610 or the Special Protection of Children Against Child Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act, and Republic Act 9208 or the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2003. Escorted by NBI-7 agents, Margallo was flown on Friday to Cagayan de Oro City where she will be facing the charges along with Scully who was arrested in Malaybalay, Bukidnon in February 2015.";No news category;No Tags;http://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/121000/secret-life-liezyl-margallo;24

(Norman V. Mendoza) Two housewives were arrested over the weekend for allegedly coaxing a 10-year-old girl to pose naked for cyberpornography in a house in barangay Basak, Lapu-Lapu City. The girl’s grandmother discovered the secret activity after the little girl came home Friday afternoon and reluctantly told her about being undressed for a session in front of a “TV.” Hours later, a joint team of the Lapu-Lapu police, the Children’s Legal Bureau (CLB) and barangay captain Isabel Darnayla went to the house of 33-year-old Marivic Bensi in sitio Sudtunggan and arrested her. The little girl’s aunt, 36-year-old Chona Ando, who had brought the child to her friend’s house, was arrested the next day in her hometown of Cordova pending the filing of charges.  Both women at first denied the allegations, but they had conflicting accounts of why they went online on Bensi’s laptop computer to contact an American friend to ask for money, said Darnayla. Cases of child exploitation and women using the Internet to offer sex photos or videos of themselves for dollar payments have been on the rise in nearby Cordova town since 2011. Yesterday was the first case of a cybersex arrest in Lapu-Lapu City. The little girl was taken yesterday to the Pink Room in the Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center, a special center for the examination and counseling of children and women victims. Earlier this week, a pregnant housewife in Cordova town and her live-in partner were arrested at home on suspicion that they were exposing their children to to Internet porn chats and live web camera feeds. The Friday arrest of the first housewife in Lapu-Lapu City took place on the same day a crackdown on human trafficking in Cordova town resulted in the controversial “rescue” of 12 girls and one boy who were pulled out of their schools and households. The sweep by a joint task force of the National Bureau of Investigation, police, social workers, and the Provincial Womens’ Commission also apprehended five adults, including some parents and relatives of the children. Authorities said they had to act swiftly because photos of the children turned up in porn websites and the hard drive of a computer seized in a May raid. The two activities were separate and boldly executed but are sure to stir controversy because they took place without arrest warrants issued by the court. In the Lapu-Lapu city arrest, barangay captian Darnayla said he had called the attention of Bensi, owner of the computer, more than two years ago for operating an unlicensed Internet cafe in her home, especially since the city governmnet had a campaign to anted to prevent cyberpornography. “I have monitored about 60 of this kind of home-based Internet enterprises, mostly in sitio Sudtonggan but they never listened,” he said. The girl’s relative, Ando, is a resident of barangay Ibabao, Cordova, the site of several prior raids for cybersex sessions involving family members and neighbors. SWIFT ACTION Lapu-Lapu City Mayor Paz Radaza yesterday commended the swift action of police and barangay officials upon learning of the first cybersex arrest in Lapu-Lapu. “I would like to thank the grandparent of the girl for her vigilance,” she said in a press statement. “I salute the barangay officials and the police for their quick action. The quick arrest sends a signal that the city will never tolerate such kind of illegal activity to thrive in our place.” Radaza had earlier bristled over initial reports that school children in Lapu-Lapu city were among those “rescued” in the Sept. 6 operation against human trafficking, especially after two high school students in her city were returned as a cases of mistaken identity. She said Lapu-Lapu city was doing its part in briefing students and families about the harm of cyberpornography down to the barangay level. “I condemn in the strongest possible terms this brutal abuse of our children and women. For those who are thinking of operating cybersex in our city, do not ever attempt to do so. We will run after you and see to it that you will be meted the harshest penalty,” she said yesterday after being informed about the arrest in Lapu-Lapu. Barangay captain Darnayla said the episode with the little girl was first revealed to the child’s grandmother who asked about her whereabouts. At first the child, who was seen in the company of her aunt, said they just went to an Internet cafe.But her grandmother pressed for details and the whole story came out. The child said she was undressed and made to pose naked in front of a “TV”, her way of describing a laptop screen. The little girl said she didn’t like it and insisted on stopping so she could go home. Her grandmother sought the help of a barangay tanod, who reported to barangay captain Darnayla at 4 p.m. Darnayla instead advised police intervention. Later in the evening, a response team of Marigondon police, a CLB representative, and the women’s desk of the police office, went to Bensi’s house at 9 p.m. and took her into custody. Bensi’s relatives protested, saying they wanted to see a warrant of arrest. The women’s desk represented by PO1 Flor Singson asked the little girl to confirm her story. The child pointed to Bensi, the computer owner, as the one who undressed her while her aunt Chona was a few steps away. The two women are friends who used to be neighbors living a few meters apart. Bensi denied the charge. She said she was just allowing her visiting friend to use her laptop to contact an American for money because Ando needed to buy rice. Ando, on the other hand, said she dropped by to give her friend a facial and was told by Bensi that she had an American friend looking for a young girl. With that, Ando took her niece to her friend’s house. Bensi, 35, is a mother of three with a 3-year-old son and an eldest son in college. Her husband is a production worker in the Mactan Export Processing Zone. Ando also has three children and a husband employed as a casual worker. Both women are based at home. The little girl’s family got angry after learning that the child was physically violated. They said they would press charges.  ;No news category;No Tags;http://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/67/10-year-old-girl-made-to-pose-for-web-camera;24
378;OVAC;‘Cyber sex victims thought it was OK’;No news platform;No Author;Tue, 10 Sep 2013 06:49:37 PST;No news type;The 13 children who were rescued from a life of online prostitution thought they were not doing anything wrong. Social worker Shalaine Lucero of the regional Department of Social Welfare and Development, said the children are undergoing debriefing as part of their rehabilitation. Their parents have yet to visit them. “They thought that it is okay because there is no direct contact with the abuser. Dili ta mag-expect nga normal ang effect sa mga bata (We shouldn’t expect that it would have a normal effect on children). There was resistance and fear in the children but we assured them that we will bring them into a secured place,” Lucero said.  Twelve girls and a boy were rescued in separate operations by a joint anti-trafficking task force in Cordova town last Friday. The youngest is seven years old while the eldest is 17. “As of yesterday, the parents did not come to our office, but they are very welcome to come and check on their children anytime,” Lucero said. Dante Bono-an, head of the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) Anti-Human Trafficking Division, said lewd pictures of the 13 children were found on pornography sites. “They have been exploited. They were asked to pose naked and perform lewd acts on the Internet. That’s a violation against the law on human trafficking and against minors. We have to rescue them so they would no longer get exploited,” he added. If the children will be transferred to a residential facility, Lucero said their basic needs would be attended to. “That is somehow giving them the feeling that they are inside a house doing normal routines, but without their parents,” she said. Lucero said most of the children were responsive while the rest were hesitant to talk. “It’s more on dwelling on the children’s feeling. Maybe when they performed, they did not realize what they did was wrong. So we are here to help them understand that,” Lucero said. She said she and other social workers will also be teaching the children how to protect and take care of themselves since they are most vulnerable to abuse such as trafficking. “It is not going to be easy. It’s not that fast. It would be until such time that they could already manage themselves in case these incidents would occur again,” Lucero added. WHAT’S UP!

379;OVAC;The road to justice;No news platform;No Author;Thu, 31 May 2018 20:48:00 PST;No news type;"For seven years now, the parents of the children who were rescued from a cybersex enterprise in Cordova town, Cebu in 2011 languish in virtual hell, locked behind bars at the Lapu-Lapu City Jail while standing trial on charges of child pornography, human trafficking and child abuse. “The cases have been submitted for decision,” said Prosecutor Lolita Lomanta who represents the state and the victims in court. Judge Ferdinand Rafanan of Regional Trial Court Branch 55 in Mandaue City will pen the decision after three of the four judges who earlier took turns to hear the cases have retired. While it could bring pain to the children, Lomanta nonetheless, hopes that the couple will get a conviction if only to render justice to their victims.  “Just imagine exploiting your own children. If you think of it, life imprisonment is not even enough for them. The law may be harsh but we have to impose it,” she said. “This must serve as a lesson for every parent or any member of the family who takes advantage of children. Until now, there are still a lot of children being exploited by members of their own family. There are just people who have not learned their lesson yet,” she added. Trial During trial, the prosecution presented 10 witnesses in court against the couple accused of exploiting their own children through a pay-per-view cyberpornography business in 2011. Cebu Vice Gov. Agnes Magpale, the first witness, choked as she described the videotape she had watched of the children in lewd poses being directed by an adult behind the camera. The tape sent to her by an informant in Cordova prompted the Provincial Women’s Commission (PWC) to call in the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI). “I couldn’t sleep after watching that,” Magpale recalled of the tape. Magpale begged the judge to view the tape himself because she could not bear describing the scenes. Agents of the US Homeland Security testified about the contents of the computer hard drive which they examined; while NBI raiders described how they caught the parents at home staging a live sex show with five of their children and a young niece in front of a web camera. Regret In an interview soon after her arrest along with her husband, the 40-year-old mother expressed remorse at what they did. “Mangayo ko og pasaylo sa akong mga anak. (I ask my children’s forgiveness),” she said while in NBI custody. “Nagmahay mi. Nahimo ni namo tungod sa among kawad- on. (We regret doing this; but we did it because of poverty),” she added. The mother said she and her husband turned to online pornography for money, transacting with foreigners and receiving dollar payments, after they stopped working in a factory in Lapu-Lapu City. The 51-year-old father, a former Mactan Export Processing Zone (MEPZ) worker, explained that the Internet racket was their only source of income and that they simply took up the business many of their neighbors were already doing. Change of mind While they initially admitted guilt, both parents made an abrupt change during arraignment and pleaded “not guilty” to charges of qualified trafficking, child abuse and child pornography. They claimed to have done no harm to their children saying that all they had in mind was their family’s future. In an affidavit, the mother denied engaging in a home-based cyberpornography business. She said the computer at home, which was purchased in December 2010 or six months before the NBI raid, was intended for the children’s school projects and assignments. She said they also earned extra money by letting neighbors use it for a fee since it had an Internet connection. “Some of our neighbors come to our house one at a time and use our computer. They pay us for every hour of use. Sometimes, after using the computer, they also pay us P150 to get money from Western Union using our name and identification card. We also shared Internet connection with some of our neighbors for a fee,” she said in the affidavit. According to her, the computer was also used by the friends of their children and some relatives while she and her husband also played computer games with it. Money transfer service The mother’s reference to Western Union (WU) was an indication of nefarious activities going on. The money transfer service is known to authorities as a popular method of payment by online porn customers to Asian females. Asked to explain why her name appeared on WU receipts, she said the money was actually for another neighbor, “Charlene”, a frequent customer of their Internet business, who, she claimed, had no ID to present to the money transfer service. For other sources of income, the mother said the family sold banana cue and other snacks in the neighborhood. At 9a.m. of June 1, 2011, NBI agents barged into the couple’s house in barangay Ibabao and arrested them. The mother said she was preparing the children to go to school for enrollment. Some were having breakfast while the others were changing their clothes after taking a bath. “They pointed their guns at all of us. They hit me at the back of my head. My daughter shouted ‘Sir, don’t hit my mother because she’s pregnant.’ But they did not heed the request of my daughter. They, instead, hit me several times,” the mother said. The agents loaded everyone on separate vans and headed for the NBI regional office in Cebu City. Social workers waiting outside, meanwhile, also bundled off the kids to the NBI office. The mother said the criminal charges may have been instigated by a neighbor who had a grudge against them. The neighbor, a certain Arsenal, has an NBI agent friend, she said. “I think these are the result of the quarrels that we had against our neighbor whose Internet connection with us was cut by my husband,” the mother claimed. Five judges The case was originally handled by Regional Trial Court (RTC) Judge Toribio Quiwag of LapuLapu City, until the Supreme Court directed that cases in Cordova town should be handled by the Mandaue City RTC . The cases were raffled off to Judge Silvestre Maamo of Mandaue City RTC Branch 55. When Maamo returned to his regular post in Cebu City, Judge Glenda Go took over the case followed by Judge Ramon Daomilas before it was finally sent to Judge Rafanan. Upon the advice of psychologists, the prosecution did not ask the children of the accused to testify in court. “We’re doing this for the best interest of the children. You can just imagine the burden of testifying against your own parents,” Lomanta said. “Even if they are aware that what was done to them was wrong, the fact remains that they still care for their parents,” she added. Saving Lives Lomanta said that the court’s verdict would not be as much of an issue as saving the children. “You can just imagine what happened to them if until now they were still exploited. If they were not rescued, can you really see the possibility that two of them would have decent jobs now, while another is about to finish her studies in social work? Whether the cases end up either conviction or acquittal does not really matter. You know the most important thing is we were able to rescue six children,” she said. “The work of a fiscal is not to convict but to make sure that justice is administered properly. We do our best, not for me, but for the children,” she said. “My goodness, what could have been their future if they were not rescued? Now, we redeemed and gave them hope. Now they have a future,” she added. (To be concluded)";No news category;No Tags;https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/177687/the-road-to-justice;25
641;OVAC;Filipino priest indicted on child porn charges in US;AJPress;AJPress;Fri, 30 Mar 2012 19:27:35 PST;article;A Roman Catholic Filipino priest, who is believed to be hiding in the Philippines after being accused of possessing child pornography and stealing from his parish in Worcester, Massachusetts, has been officially indicted, according to the Worcester Telegram. The Telegram reported a grand jury in Worcester County on Friday indicted Rev. Lowe B. Dongor with possession of child pornography and larceny over $250.  Authorities have issued a warrant for the arrest of Dongor, who is believed to have fled to the Philippines after being charged with possession of child pornography and stealing from his parish last year. Several Philippine media outlets have reported that Dongor has returned to his hometown of Barotac Nuevo, Iloilo, in October. Dongor, the Diocese of Worcester’s first Filipino priest, is accused of having images of young pre-pubescent girls in various states of undress in his laptop computer. A computer technician found the images and reported it to police.  During questioning, he allegedly admitted that on several occasions he stole “$40 or $60” from the parish office in Fitchburg to wire home to his family in the Philippines and also admitted to visiting several child pornography websites. He was released on personal recognizance by Judge Andrew L. Mandell and was ordered not to use computers and not to have unsupervised contact with children under 14.  Authorities issued a warrant for his arrest after Dongor missed a preliminary hearing last year. They said they are working with Philippine local enforcement to locate and bring Dongor back to the US to face the charges.  After his arrest, the Diocese of Worcester has asked the Vatican to defrock Dongor under the Vatican’s Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith stating, “the acquisition, possession, and distribution of child pornography is a canonical delict that pertains to the sexual abuse of a minor.” Joseph Pimentel/AJPress;;['Crime', 'Lowe B.

The video has reached millions of viewers since launching about 10 days ago, she told AFP.  “The response to the campaign has been overwhelming,” the spokeswoman said. “In the first week and a half of the campaign, the ads have been viewed online a total of 11 million times.”  The pornography awareness advert has racked up almost two million views on YouTube alone. “In the case of the pornography ad, it draws attention to the fact that many young people learn about sex from pornography,” the spokeswoman said. “It can be upsetting for younger kids and sends poor messages about consent, body image and sex to teens.” The campaign is due to run until the end of July.;World;['campaign', 'New Zealand', 'online safety', 'porn', 'Pornography'];https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1295120/new-zealand-online-porn-safety-campaign-goes-viral;1
1252;OVAC;Los Angeles man gets life for child abuse, making porn in PH;Filamstar.net (INQUIRER.net News Partner);Jun Medina;Wed, 03 Jun 2015 00:15:02 PST;article;Convicted rapist and child sex abuser Stanley Dan Reczko III. DALY CITY — A Los Angeles man, who made child pornography in the Philippines after serving time for child rape, was sentenced May 18 to life in federal prison without possibility of parole. Stanley Dan Reczko III, 50, who was required to register as a sex offender after his rape conviction, was convicted in March of making child pornography in the Philippines.  Reczko was arrested in September 2007 after returning to the United States, the U.S. Attorney’s Office said. Prosecutors said Reczko abused a 16-year-old Filipina victim for three years, producing “eight series of child pornography,” in which he appeared with his victim.  Harsh sentence deserved Authorities said Reczko’s criminal history justified the harsh sentence.  “This defendant has a life-long history of violent behavior,” said Acting United States Attorney Stephanie Yonekura. “He has received treatment and counseling, but in light of this case, the help offered to him appears to have had no effect.  “Even though he has previously served prison time for the rape of a minor, this punishment did not deter his behavior. In light of his recidivism, the life prison sentence is richly deserved,” Yonekura added. In the first part of a bifurcated trial, a federal jury in February found Reczko guilty of sexual exploitation by producing child pornography in the Philippines. In law, bifurcation refers to the judge’s ability to divide a trial into two parts so as to render a judgment on a set of legal issues without looking at all aspects. Reczko received the life sentence for the sexual exploitation charge, and he received a consecutive 10-year term for producing child pornography while being required to register as a sex offender, Yonekura said in a press statement.  The DA said Reczko has been in custody since 2007, when he was arrested by agents of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) upon arrival from the Philippines. Warning to predators “This sentence should serve as a warning to sexual predators who mistakenly believe they can escape justice by exploiting children overseas,” said Mark Selby, deputy special agent in charge for HSI Los Angeles. “There can be no place for the abuse of foreign children by our citizens, and HSI will seek to vindicate the rights of those victims no matter how far they live from our shores. Fortunately, the sentence imposed today virtually assures that no additional children will be harmed by this defendant.” Prosecutors said authorities began investigating Reczko in May 2007 after the minor-victim handed over a CD containing child pornography to the International Justice Mission (IJM), a non-governmental organization working in the Philippines. The IJM provided the CD, along with other evidence, to American law enforcement officers working out of the U.S. Embassy in Manila. The evidence showed that Reczko had used the minor to produce eight series of child pornography, which included images of him having sexual intercourse with the victim. According to prosecutors, Reczko sexually, physically, emotionally and mentally abused the victim for three years. Reczko was a registered sex offender. He pleaded guilty in 1997 to the first-degree rape of a 12-year-old in New York, according to court documents.

1271;OVAC;Young sex predator claims she was abused by her ma;Philippine Daily Inquirer;Ador Vincent S. Mayol;Sun, 29 Jan 2017 00:02:53 PST;article; CEBU CITY—The suspected sexual predator has told authorities that she wanted her victims to go through the same ordeal she had as a child.  Liezyl Margallo, 23, told agents of the National Bureau of Investigation who arrested her that she, too, was physically abused by her own mother when she was young. “Apparently, that was a traumatic experience for her,” lawyer Janet Francisco, head of the Manila-based NBI Anti-Human Trafficking Division, told the Inquirer in an interview.  Margallo was arrested on Malapascua Island on the northern tip of Cebu on Wednesday by NBI agents who served the 16 pending arrest warrants against her, ending a manhunt that lasted nearly two years. She was flown back to Cagayan de Oro City, where she is now detained. Margallo is facing a string of charges for the torture and sexual abuse of at least nine children—one of whom died.  Speaking to Francisco, Margallo claimed she was maltreated by her mother. “She wanted to retaliate by hurting children, and she found pleasure in doing it,” Francisco said, adding: “I sat down with her and she told me she regretted everything she did to the kids. (But) she has to answer for everything she committed against the children. Inasmuch as we pity her, justice must be served.” Aussie partner Margallo and her live-in partner, Australian Peter Gerard Scully, who was arrested in Malaybalay, Bukidnon, in February 2015, are facing charges of violating provisions of the Anti-Photo and Video Voyeurism Act of 2009, and the Special Protection of Children Against Child Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act and Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2003. The couple allegedly conspired in luring female street children and young scavengers into their fold, forcing them to perform sexual acts, torturing them and killing a 12-year-old girl.  Before her arrest, Margallo reportedly rented a condominium unit in uptown Cebu City for P13,000 a month, availed of a membership in a posh gym, and traveled to different local destinations like Bohol as a tourist guide, who offering sex for a fee, the NBI said. Investigation showed that Margallo and Scully started videotaping lewd actions of minors after they met in the Philippines in 2011. With the use of a laptop, Scully and Margallo filmed the videos in different areas in Mindanao, featuring young girls who were lured with promises of money and comfortable lives in exchange for performing lewd acts. The couple would make these films in response to requests from foreign clients, who paid to livestream videos of children being tortured and sexually abused. The couple sold every video at $10,000. The victims, aged 1 to 12 years old, were rescued in 2015 and are now under the custody of the Department of Social Welfare and Development in Cagayan de Oro City. Francisco said the NBI continues its investigation to identify and arrest possible cohorts of Margallo in the Philippines. Maryjun Delgado, a psychologist based in Cebu City, said that judging by the way the accused acted, Margallo’s behavior was clearly perverted. “She wants to hurt kids to appease her experiences. She wants to feel how it is to be an abuser, and she enjoys what she’s doing. And yes, she is not afraid to kill,”  Delgado said./rga ;Headlines;['child abuse', 'child torture', 'child trafficking', 'cyberpornography', 'Janet Francisco', 'Liezyl Margallo', 'Peter Gerard Scully'];https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/866264/young-sex-predator-claims-she-was-abused-by-her-ma;7

(CDN PHOTO/JUNJIE MENDOZA) A month after their rescue, 15 boys and girls who were invited by an Australian tourist to a Cordova town beach resort where they were photographed in lewd poses remain in protective custody of the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD). The parents have not been allowed to see their children until it is determined that it is safe to send the kids home. Ermelita Degamo, head of Lapu-Lapu City’s social welfare office, said authorities are still assessing the involvement of the parents in the case of pornography and human trafficking filed against the foreigner. Absent from school, the children will not fall too behind in their studies.  The center where they are staying offers the Alternative Learning System (ALS) in coordination with the city government and the Department of Education (Deped)-7. “The kids have been staying here for a couple of weeks already. We can’t let them stop and sacrifice their studies while they are here at the center. They are following a module where teachers come here for scheduled classes,” said Degamo. The children are undergoing psychosocial intervention such as dialog with peers, guided plays, home life system and custodial care. “I can say that the kids are enjoying their stay here. At first, they insisted on going home but as they see other kids playing, they also play and forget about going home,” Degamo said. She said the children have become more sociable compared to the first days of their stay. Degamo couldn’t give a time frame to complete the assessment. They plan to have a dialog with the parents, the Children’s Legal Bureau and other stakeholders. Parents had tried to get their children out of the DSWD center but were prohibited from seeing the minors, until it is clarified whether the children were exposed to a sexual predator with the consent of their parents. The manager of Cordova Home Village told the Provincial Board the other day that the resort staff didn’t notice anything amiss because the children were accompanied to the resort by their parents to attend what the management thought was a birthday party of the Cebuana girlfriend of a guest Peter James Robinson. Robinson was arrested on June 24. He is set to be arraigned on charges of child pornography, and qualified human trafficking before the Regional Trial Court in Mandaue City. He chose not to file a counter-affidavit with the prosecutor’s office.

105;PVAC;Filipino in Maryland accused of child sex abuse out on bail;Filamstar.net/INQUIRER.net News Partner;Maricar CP Hampton;Tue, 14 Jul 2015 01:03:58 PST;article;Accused teacher, Erwin Magnaye. FILAMSTAR PHOTO WASHINGTON, D.C. — Erwin Magnaye, the Filipino teacher who was arrested last month for allegedly sexually abusing a student at Paca Elementary School in Landover, Maryland, recently was released from the state’s Department of Corrections. He currently is out on bail and is awaiting his preliminary hearing. “On May 18, 2015, a consular team from the Embassy was able to visit Mr. Magnaye at the facility where he was detained. He was temporarily released days later after posting bail and is now awaiting the schedule of the preliminary hearing,” an official embassy statement said.  Magnaye, 39, from Laurel, Maryland, was accused of having inappropriate encounters with a 9-year old boy beginning in September 2014. According to police reports filed by the boy’s mother in February, Magnaye kissed her son and also inappropriately touched him on several occasions while the two were alone in a classroom.  On top of the charges of sexual abuse of a minor he is also being charged with second-degree assault, along with several other offenses. Magnaye, a math and science instructor, had been under the surveillance of the Prince George Police Department for months prior to his arrest. He is now on administrative leave.  The Philippine Embassy is keeping close watch on the case and constantly updating the Department of Foreign Affairs in the Philippines on developments, said Vice Consul Darell Ann Artates of the embassy’s Public Diplomacy Section.  It is also coordinating with Magnaye’s friends and colleagues in Maryland any assistance he may need. Migrant Heritage Commission (MHC), a Washington D.C.-based law firm, said it was extending pro bono consultation services to Magnaye to ensure due process and afford him the opportunity to defend himself in the courts. A crowd-funding platform called Funded Justice is also extending assistance to Magnaye.

119;PVAC;Pope slams sex tourism and organ trafficking;Agence France-Presse;Agence France-Presse;Mon, 23 Apr 2012 22:56:21 PST;article;Pope Benedict XVI   AP PHOTO/ALESSANDRA TARANTINO VATICAN CITY—Pope Benedict XVI called on the international community to tackle sex tourism and organ trafficking on Monday, slamming the abuse, torture and exploitation of minors in particular. Tourism can facilitate people trafficking “for sexual exploitation or organ harvesting, as well as the exploitation of minors,” the pope said in a speech to mark the 2012 World Congress on the Pastoral Care of Tourism.  These are “evils that must be dealt with urgently since they trample upon the rights of millions of men and women, especially among the poor, minors and handicapped,” the pope said. The United Nations estimates there are around 2.5 million victims of human trafficking in the world at any one time.  The pope – who has faced thousands of clerical sex abuse scandals in Europe and the US since becoming pontiff – condemned “the exploitation of minors, abandoned into the hands of individuals without scruples.” “Sexual tourism is one of the most abject of these deviations that devastate morally, psychologically and physically the life of so many persons and families, and sometimes whole communities,” he said.  Benedict urged “those who are engaged for pastoral reasons or who work in the field of tourism, and the whole international community, to increase their vigilance and to foresee and oppose such aberrations.” The Catholic Church has launched initiatives to tackle sexual abuse by priests following decades of cover-ups, including a summit on clerical child abuse and an Internet-based Center for Child Protection opened this year.;World;['child abuse', 'Pope', 'Religion', 'Tourism', 'trafficking', 'Vatican'];https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/181553/pope-slams-sex-tourism-and-organ-trafficking;13
122;PVAC;Frankie Pangilinan fires back at Ben Tulfo on blaming women for sexual abuse;INQUIRER.net;Niña V. Guno;Sun, 14 Jun 2020 12:54:11 PST;article;"Frankie Pangilinan. Image: Instagram/@frankiepangilinan Frankie Pangilinan fired back at TV host Ben Tulfo after he said that the way women dress is “inviting the beast” — namely rapists. “STOP TEACHING GIRLS HOW TO DRESS?? TEACH PEOPLE NOT TO RAPE,” Pangilinan tweeted yesterday, June 13, reacting to a news report of a police station in Quezon province that warned women not to wear short clothes and then report harassment.  Ben Tulfo, who hosts public service program “Bitag”, commented on Pangilinan’s sentiments last night. “Hija @kakiep83, a rapist or a juvenile sex offender’s desire to commit a crime will always be there. All they need is an opportunity, when to commit the crime.” He also told women to watch what they wear to avoid sexual crimes.“Sexy ladies, careful with the way you dress up! You are inviting the beast.”  Pangilinan defended her points today, June 14: “Rape culture is real and a product of this precise line of thinking, where the behavior is normalized, particularly by men.” Rape culture is an environment where sexual violence against women is the norm, and is perpetuated in behaviors such as objectifying women’s bodies, as per the Marshall University’s Women’s Center.  “[T]he way anyone dresses should not be deemed as ‘opportunity’ to sexually assault them. [E]ver,” she stressed. Finally, she took a jab at the way Tulfo addressed her. “[C]alling me hija will not belittle my point.” She has also changed her name on Twitter to “hija”. Image: screengrab via Twitter/@kakiep83 She shared too a screenshot of Tulfo’s longer statement on Facebook against her, where he called her “the wannabe smart aleck”. the way he was braver on fb because he knows i’m not on there ???? pic.twitter.com/fAuzS7ukhD — hija (@kakiep83) June 14, 2020   “Batang-bata ka pa para malaman mo ang mundo,” he told the 19-year-old college student whose parents are actress Sharon Cuneta and Senator Francis “Kiko” Pangilinan. Insisting that perverts and rapists cannot be reformed, he said, “Ang tanging magagawa ay manamit ng tama. Huwag nating pukawin ang pagnanasa nila. Ito ang iyong magagawa.” (You are too young to know about the world. The only thing you can do is to dress appropriately. Let us not stir their desires. That is what you can do.) “[T]he way he was braver on [FB] because he knows [I]’m not on there,” Pangilinan remarked. Appearing “young, pretty or desirable” is a false stereotype of rape victims, according to “Making Sense of Rape”, a published review of Supreme Court decisions by the Women’s Legal Bureau. In one case, an 8-month-old baby was a victim. WLB previously told INQUIRER.net that victims of sexual abuse struggle to find justice and are further traumatized because of prejudices against them, such as in not being believed because of the clothes they were wearing at the time of incident.

127;PVAC;Cultural trends changing how Filipinos behave;Philippine Daily Inquirer;Chiqui Escareal-Go, Josiah Go;Fri, 01 Sep 2017 05:10:31 PST;article;"It’s the season for planning in the marketing industry once again and it is good to remind stakeholders that contrary to popular belief, when consumers make a choice, they do not decide based on just the product, place, promo and price. There are other factors that affect buying behavior: Cultural (culture, sub-culture, social class), social (reference groups, roles and status, family), personal (age and lifecycle, occupation, economic situation, lifestyle, personality and self-concept) and psychological (motivation, perception, learning, belief and attitudes).  Below is a list of cultural, social, personal and psychological factors observed in the Philippines that may change the course of your marketing plans in 2018. They are included in our forthcoming book “Principles and Practices in Marketing,” which is set for release before the end of 2017. Home  The absence of parents in a third of homes and the increasing role of schools in instilling values. The social disorders associated with the increasing absence of parents in the lives of their children (drugs, child sex abuse, teen pregnancy, among others).  The change in the boundaries and sequence of love, marriage, sex and family. The rise in the number of single parents. The trend towards late marriages and smaller families. The upgraded role of music as surrogate companion. The rise of “adultescents” (a play of the words adult and adolescent). They are also called the Peter Pan generation, or the 30-something adults who are still single and without kids, mortgages and responsibilities.  The rise of stay-at-home “housebands” looking after children and house needs. More men becoming purchase decision-makers of grocery products (the mansumers). The increasing ratio of people 40 years old and above wanting to take control of their health. Work The desire to migrate and the rise of middle class among overseas Filipino workers (OFW). The expanding number of call center workers and their odd working hours to conform to working time abroad. The vanishing breed known as househelps. The desire of senior citizens to have second careers. Women The increasing role of women in the workforce due to better education and social equality.

 The increasing number of millennial women who do not know how to cook nor cook as well as their moms. Women have become more liberal when it comes to their sexual and relationship behaviors (including promiscuity). Communication The emergence of cheap smartphones. People relying more and more on free texting via apps such as Line and Messenger. The reemergence of voice calls, thanks to features from apps like Whatsapp and Viber. The continuing shift of advertising from traditional to digital. Owning multiple mobile phones. We have become more accepting of foreign cultures (American music, Korean pop and television shows, Indian yoga, Chinese feng shui, Japanese anime). The swelling number of netizens and their reliance on online tools to keep in touch.

 Opinions are shaped not just by watchdogs, but also by strangers in social media. The openness to talk to strangers and fellow customers. The emerging consciousness of people to self-organize and help others in times of natural disasters. Technology The increasing reliance on tech-based solutions to manage personal life and work. The rise of omnichannel. More online activists are creating noise. The rise of virtual reality and augmented reality. Shopping The increasing influence of online celebrities like bloggers.

 The middle and upper class condemning non-environment friendly products and practices. “Tingi” (small portions), sachets, “lista” (credit) and “four-gives” installment style of payment will always be popular. Value brands and private labels are becoming patronized. These include SM Bonus, National Book Store’s Best Buy, HBC’s personal care products. The openness to try new brands, including generic drugs or alternative health remedies. The continued growth of microfinancing options. Channel Relying more on deliveries (for food, medicine, car batteries, LPG, etc). The increasing preference for smaller store formats. Convenience stores as go-to for fast food. The growing popularity of multilevel marketing.

 Lifestyle The demanding lifestyle of the working class leading to stress and lack of sleep. The growing consciousness for planning discretionary time. The desire to buy new gadgets and spend on travel. The frequent visit to malls as instant escape. The increasing dominance of point-of-purchase activities (packaging, display, sampling, etc). Expansive food knowledge, instead of owning expensive cars, as a sign of sophistication. The use of visual communication like emojis and memes. Buying preferences Shifting priorities—from ownership to access (like car sharing).

Begum had never seen a computer until a few years ago, but now she’s on Skype regularly with her husband. A woman on a bicycle brings the Internet to her. Dozens of “Info Ladies” bike into remote Bangladeshi villages with laptops and Internet connections, helping tens of thousands of people – especially women – get everything from government services to chats with distant loved ones. AP/A.M. Ahad JHARABARSHA, Bangladesh — Amina Begum had never seen a computer until a few years ago, but now she’s on Skype regularly with her husband. A woman on a bicycle brings the Internet to her. Dozens of “Info Ladies” bike into remote Bangladeshi villages with laptops and Internet connections, helping tens of thousands of people — especially women — get everything from government services to chats with distant loved ones. It’s a vital service in a country where only 5 million of 152 million people have Internet access.  The Info Ladies project, created in 2008 by local development group D.Net and other community organizations, is modeled after a program that helped make cellphones widespread in Bangladesh. It intends to enlist thousands more workers in the next few years with startup funds from the South Asian country’s central bank and expatriates working around the world. D.Net recruits the women and trains them for three months to use a computer, the Internet, a printer and a camera. It arranges bank loans for the women to buy bicycles and equipment.  “This way we are providing jobs to jobless women and at the same time empowering villagers with critical information,” said Ananya Raihan, D.Net’s executive director. The women — usually undergraduates from middle-class rural families — aren’t doling out charity. Begum pays 200 takas ($2.40) for an hour of Skype time with her husband, who works in Saudi Arabia.  Begum smiles shyly when her husband’s cheerful face pops up. With earphones in place, she excitedly tells him she received the money he sent last month. He asks her to buy farm land.  Even Begum’s elderly mother-in-law now uses Skype to talk with her son. “We prefer using Skype to mobile phones because this way we can see him on the screen,” Begum said, beaming happily from her tiny farming village in Gaibandha district, 120 miles (192 kilometers) north of the capital, Dhaka. In the neighboring village of Saghata, an Info Lady is 16-year-old Tamanna Islam Dipa’s connection to social media. “I don’t have any computer, but when the Info Lady comes I use her laptop to chat with my Facebook friends,” she said. “We exchange our class notes and sometimes discuss social issues, such as bad effects of child marriage, dowry and sexual abuse of girls.”  The Info Ladies also provide a slew of social services — some for a fee and others for free. They sit with teenage girls where they talk about primary health care and taboo subjects like menstrual hygiene, contraception and HIV. They help villagers seeking government services write complaints to authorities under the country’s newly-enacted Right to Information Act. They talk to farmers about the correct use of fertilizer and insecticides. For 10 takas (12 cents) they help students fill college application forms online. They’re even trained to test blood pressure and blood sugar levels. “The Info Ladies are both entrepreneurs and public service providers,” Raihan said. Raihan borrowed the idea from Bangladeshi Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, who in 2004 introduced mobile phones to rural women who had no access to telephones of any kind, by training and sending out scores of “Mobile Ladies” into the countryside. That hugely successful experiment drew in commercial mobile phone operators. Now more than 92 million people in Bangladesh have cellphone access. Nearly 60 Info Ladies are working in 19 of Bangladesh’s 64 districts. By 2016, Raihan hopes to train 15,000 women. In July, Bangladesh’s central bank agreed to offer interest-free loans to Info Ladies. Distribution of the first phase of loans, totaling 100 million takas ($1.23 million), will begin in December. Raihan said D.Net is also encouraging the large population of Bangladeshi expatriates to send money home to help Info Ladies get started. “It’s very innovative,” says Jamilur Reza Chaudhury, a pioneer of information technology education in Bangladesh. “The project is really having an impact on the people at grass-root level.” Info Lady Sathi Akhtar, who works in Begum’s and Dipa’s villages, said she makes more at the job than she would as a school teacher. She said that after making payments on her 120,000 taka ($1,480) loan and covering other costs, she takes home an average of 10,000 takas ($123) a month.

167;PVAC;Parents shouldn’t condemn their gay kids — Pope;No news platform;No Author;Mon, 27 Aug 2018 21:54:54 PST;No news type;"  Knock, Ireland — Pope Francis says parents of gay children shouldn’t condemn them, ignore their orientation or throw them out of the house.
Rather, he says they should pray, talk and try to understand. Speaking to reporters after closing out a Catholic family rally in Ireland, Francis said: “There have always been gay people and people with homosexual tendencies.” Francis was asked what he would tell a father of a child who just came out as gay. Francis said he would first suggest prayer.  “Don’t condemn. Dialogue. Understand, give the child space so he or she can express themselves.” Francis said it might be necessary seek psychiatric help if a child begins to exhibit “worrisome” traits, but that it’s something else if an adult comes out as gay. He urged parents not to respond with silence. “Ignoring child with this tendency shows a lack of motherhood and fatherhood.” He said: “This child has the right to a family. And the family not throwing him out.” Meanwhile, Pope Francis is defending his procedures to hold bishops accountable for covering up priestly sex abuse, saying a tribunal isn’t necessary and that his ad-hoc approach works better. Francis was asked en route home from Ireland on Sunday about demands from abuse survivors to implement his 2015 decision to create a tribunal section inside the Vatican to judge negligent bishops. Francis scrapped the idea in 2016 and instead laid out legal procedures to use the existing Vatican bureaucracy to investigate complaints, and then for a college of legal experts to weigh in and advise the pope. Francis said a full-fledged tribunal “wasn’t viable or convenient because of the different cultures of the bishops who must be judged.” Instead, he said the ad-hoc jury system “works better” and that “several” bishops had already been judged. Pope Francis has declined to confirm or deny claims by the Vatican’s retired US ambassador that he briefed the pope in 2013 about sexual misconduct allegations against disgraced ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick.";No news category;No Tags;http://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/191258/parents-shouldnt-condemn-gay-kids-pope;20

(CONTRIBUTED PHOTO/SONIA DE DIOS) “Who would have thought an innocent looking young girl is the same person accused of committing vile crimes?” This was the reaction of Sonia de Dios, who saw Liezel “Gina” Margallo on Malapascua Island. Margallo, 23, who had 16 pending arrest warrants in Cagayan de Oro City for human trafficking and sexual abuse of minors, had been staying at Sunset Beach Resort, which was located next to the resort owned by De Dios’ sister. Margallo, who reportedly became a sex escort to foreign tourists while in hiding from authorities for nearly two years, was on the island for two days together with two young Caucasians prior to her arrest.  According to De Dios, a National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) agent who is a family friend showed her brother a photo of Margallo at the port of Maya just before they got on board the motor banca, which was owned and operated by her brother. “He (NBI agent) showed the photo to Ramon, my brother, who owns Mabuhay motor banca. Ramon told our NBI friend that he thought he saw her in the island so they immediately left for Malapascua.” (READ: ‘SAVAGE GIRL’ FALLS) Upon arriving at the island at around 10 a.m. on Wednesday, the agents immediately showed the photo of Margallo to people in the island just in time when Margallo, with her two friends, passed by them on their way to have lunch at Mabuhay restaurant. “The NBI agent approached her and asked her ‘are you Gina?’ and she replied ‘yes’. She was then handcuffed.” Liezyl Margallo, 23, was arrested in a resort on Malapascua Island on Jan. 24, 2017. (CONTRIBUTED PHOTO/SONIA DE DIOS) De Dios said everyone on the island and who saw Margallo could not believe that she was a criminal who, in cahoots with her Australian live-in partner Peter Scully, engaged in the torture and sexual abuse of about a dozen children as young as one year old and even in the torture and killing of a 12-year-old girl. “We kept looking at her while they were having lunch at the Mabuhay restaurant, which my brother also owns, and we could not believe it. She looked so innocent and so young,” she said. De Dios said they are happy at the same time relieved that she was arrested. “Who knows what they were planning while they were here. It’s a relief,” she said. Margallo with her two friends were escorted by the NBI agents out of the island around 1:30 p.m. on Wednesday, De Dios said.  ;No news category;No Tags;http://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/120698/malapascua-resident-aghast-that-a-vile-woman-hid-in-their-paradise-island;20
169;PVAC;‘The grace to weep, to be ashamed’;Philippine Daily Inquirer;Ma. Ceres P. Doyo;Thu, 10 Jul 2014 00:42:17 PST;article;"Pope Francis stirred our hearts once again when he addressed victims of sexual abuse committed by members of the clergy. His words could very well be for many other clerical transgressions that diminish human beings. His opening lines conveyed pure pain: “The scene where Peter sees Jesus emerge after a terrible interrogation…  Peter whose eyes meet the gaze of Jesus and weeps…  This scene comes to my mind as I look at you, and think of so many men and women, boys and girls. I feel the gaze of Jesus and I ask for the grace to weep, the grace for the Church to weep and make reparation for her sons and daughters who betrayed their mission, who abused innocent persons.”  The biblical scene that Pope Francis used to depict betrayal and shame I now juxtapose with a recent shameful incident involving a priest in Cebu who publicly humiliated a 17-year-old single mother who was having her baby baptized. In front of a small crowd he shamed her by saying that the baby was a product of sin and that, though innocent, the baby will bear the result of the parents’ sinful act, and so on and so forth. The other disgusting things he uttered I don’t want to repeat here. Spoken in Cebuano (which I understand), the shaming was so shocking I wished I were there to defend the teenager. While the priest was trashing the young mother, everyone in the baptismal party remained calm and humble. To describe the priest as bastos is to make an understatement. If I were to defend the teenager I would not do what the priest did; I would not shame him publicly right there and then though the temptation would be hard to resist. I would go after him when the baptismal rites were over and tell him off gently while his gaze met mine.  My mouthful: “But didn’t Jesus forgive the woman caught in adultery? Didn’t he challenge her stoners? Why would you humiliate a young mother, not out of her teens, in front of people during a sacramental rite? What do you know about the circumstances of her pregnancy? She’s young, she made a mistake. Didn’t Pope Francis show compassion when he baptized the baby of an unwed couple?” I will hold my tongue and not tell him off that there are priests who fornicate.  Well, the teenager’s family knew the perfect way of getting even, if not seeking grievance. That very night last Sunday, the grandmother, Jievelyn Gonzales, 37, uploaded the baptismal video on Facebook. It went viral, with more than 30,000 shares as of two days ago. Netizens were enraged.  Follow-up reports revealed that the young mother had wanted to end her life at some point. She was depressed and distraught when she realized that she was pregnant. Despite the emotional state she was in, she decided to keep her baby. The teenager said she wished the priest had talked to her privately instead of publicly berating her. Forgiveness was a difficult thing to do, she said. The offending priest is Fr. Romeo Obach, CSsR (Congregation of the Holy Redeemer founded by St. Alphonsus Liguori in 1732). The Redemptorist Fathers run Baclaran Church, to where countless Filipinos flock to seek the intercession of Our Lady of Perpetual Help. * * * A footnote: The late good Fr. Louie Hechanova was a Redemptorist who held a high position in the congregation. He wrote a book on the historical, cultural and spiritual significance of the Baclaran Marian devotion. (I wrote a review of it.) Fr. Rudy Romano, who was abducted by Marcos elements and who remains missing to this day, was a Redemptorist. Brother Karl Gaspar, a theologian and former political detainee, is a Redemptorist. I know the contemplative Redemptoristine nuns. A friend of mine who was once a political detainee, and who spent decades in development work among the poor, became a Redemptoristine.  Priests make mistakes and they, too, get to taste humiliation. Getting bashed on the Internet by tens of thousands of netizens is no joke. But we do not know where he was coming from, what personal issues he was grappling with at that time, whether he had a hidden antipathy for pregnant women, etc. Clearly, the priest needs healing himself. Here is Father Obach’s apology: “I am now making a public heartfelt apology to the mother of the child and her immediate family. The words I said and the rude attitude that I showed before I performed the rite of baptism last Sunday at the Sacred Heart Chapel was indeed unbecoming. “I deeply regret that I have done this. I only later realized how cruel my ways to educate and impart lessons for the said event. I am deeply sorry to the mother of the child, her relatives, the sponsors and witnesses of the incident. I am sorry to the Internet viewers, to media listeners and viewers for the mistake I personally admit. I am deeply sorry and I humbly ask your forgiveness.” Obach’s superiors have temporarily barred him from publicly performing his priestly duties and are trying to make it up to the offended family.  Yes, there’s more to be done by members of the clergy and the religious. Right now, the Association of Major Religious Superiors of Men in the Philippines is holding its regular conference in Bohol. I have asked the Office of Women and Gender Concerns (I am in the board) of the Association of Major Religious Superiors (of Women and Men) in the Philippines if we can take up this issue.

Buhay. LINKHEDCHICAGO—A Filipino American from a far western suburb of this city has been sentenced June 15 to 45 years in prison for a sexually assaulting a foster child between January and May in 2004. Noel F. Buhay, 49, of Sugar Grove, Illinois, was convicted in March by a jury for three felony counts of predatory criminal sexual assault of a child who was under 12 years old at the time of the crime which took place at Buhay’s house.  Assistant State Prosecutor Lori Schmidt said during her opening statement last March, “The boy, who hoped for a normal life complete with family vacations and stability, was taken advantage of by Buhay, who saw the child as a ‘perfect victim’”who was placed under the care of Buhay and his wife by the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services in early 2004. The prosecutors of the Kane County state’s attorney’s office said in a press statement that Buhay has to serve 85 percent of his sentence before he will qualify for parole. However, Buhay’s trial and tribulations are far from over.  In 2013,  Buhay was accused of 27 counts alleging sexual abuse and assault of a second boy.  Buhay then contacted his former foster child to tell him to keep quiet about the allegations made against him. It was only in 2014 that Kane County prosecutors charged Buhay on the crimes he committed against his foster child.  Buhay is due in court on August 24 for the charges involving his alleged second victim. ;No news category;['Assistant State prosecutor Lori Schmidt', 'child rape', 'child sex abuse', 'foster children', 'Illinois Department of Children and Family Services', 'Noel F.

Fr. Moises Cabrera, who between 1985 and 1988 served as a priest at St. Thomas the Apostle in Huntsville was among 42 individuals named in the report.  The Huntsville church was one of six parishes in which Cabrera served over this three-year span. He was removed from ministry in 1988 but began serving in Manila in 1994, according to a report by The Huntsville Item. Among Cabrera’s assignments had been at Prince of Peace, Houston, St. Ambrose, St. Augustine, St. Michael, St. Rose of Lima – all in Houston, Texas — St. Thomas the Apostle, Huntsville.

CONTRIBUTED TOWSON, Maryland — I remember vividly. It was a sunny morning, and I was playing on the veranda of our house in Marilao, Bulacan. I was sitting on this low table while playing with my doll. I remember his cheap cologne and scratchy stubble on me like it was just yesterday.  Our male helper, who must have been in his 20s, started talking to me and then started kissing my arms, shoulders, and neck. Someone came and he stopped. I was around five years old then because I was not in school yet. I told my mom that evening. As I remember, I told my mom in a conversational manner and not like I was scared. I just knew something was not right. I remember my mom was calm, but I sensed her being upset. I was the youngest, and the only girl, of four siblings. So, as you can imagine I was very protected in my family.  I never saw him again after that day. My mom and I have always been very close, I told her everything. Looking back, I told my mom, a full-time housewife then, easily because I was a child and I did not associate it with embarrassment but rather more a question of why he was touching me.  As I grew older I remember that I was touched inappropriately, but unconsciously I tried to erase it from my memory. I never talked about it with anyone until this past weekend. I told my husband and children. And up to this day, I had to ask my husband and children’s permission if it is okay with them that I share this with the outside world. With her family–husband, Floyd Owens, and children, Michael and Ayana. CONTRIBUTED Recent news about sexual abuse and #whyIdidnttell made me remember what happened to me, and like everyone else who has been through any kind of sexual trauma, it makes you remember. I just told a therapist my story and personal aversion to anything furry-like or soft touching me, I never thought that this may have stemmed from what happened to me 50 years ago. Now I feel a certain kind of relief that while it happened to me, it is okay to talk about it. Last night I shared it with my closest cousin who is like a sister to me, and this is what she texted back: “You are BRAVE. You are ADMIRED. You did not create the ugly story BUT you will write the ending 50 years later. Silenced no more! Now, u are part of the strong women that are rewriting history. I CELEBRATE YOU!” I was 5 years old then and it has been 50 years ago, but I still remember. I decided to tell my story because I advocate for women, but I was embarrassed to admit my story — now this is my story! #whyIdidnttell Bella Santos Owens is the chairwoman of the newly formed Baltimore County Human Trafficking Work Group, created by an executive order of the Baltimore County Executive Kevin Kamenetz on January 25, 2018, to address the complex issue of human trafficking.

260;PVAC;New Fortnite mission: Reaching out to abused children;Agence France-Presse;;Thu, 18 Jun 2020 18:28:28 PST;article;"A special project in France allowed children vulnerable to domestic abuse to have a communication channel within “Fortnite”. Image: Istock.com/mtreasure via AFP Relaxnews During France’s coronavirus lockdown, a futuristic blue-winged avatar joined the wildly popular world of Fortnite, but its goal was not to be the last person standing — its job was to give young victims of abuse a chance to tell their stories. The secret project was launched by the French children’s aid group L’Enfant Bleu (Blue Child), which disclosed its Fortnite partnership this week in hopes the idea can be applied to more online games.  “The number one challenge is getting children to talk so that adults can identify the problem,” said Blue Child’s director Laura Morin. “Young children do not use the same media that we do as adults. So we have to adapt and find new ways of establishing contact with them,” she said.  Health experts had warned that children could be especially vulnerable to domestic violence while forced to stay home during the COVID-19 outbreak, since some 80% of physical, psychological or sexual acts of abuse are committed by a member of a child’s close family. French officials said the country’s child danger hotline had seen an 89% surge in weekly calls after one month of lockdown compared with a year earlier.  To discreetly reach out to potential victims without alerting their parents or other abusers, Enfant Bleu volunteers took turns roaming Fortnite battle arenas every day until 10:30 p.m. (20:30 Greenwich Mean Time Zone).  At the same time, the association enlisted Fortnite stars with large followings on Snapchat or Instagram, and whose games are often followed live by thousands of people via Twitch and other platforms, to spread the message. “If you are a victim of any kind of violence, add the account Epic EnfantBleu on Fortnite to talk privately,” read messages on the instant messaging feeds that run alongside the games. ‘Extraordinary number’ Some 1,200 children and teenagers aged 10 to 17 spoke with the avatar during the monthlong operation, “an extraordinary number,” Morin said.  Most of them clicked merely out of curiosity but around a third described “personal problems,” including some who said they were in “urgent danger,” she said. The volunteers running the avatar would try to engage the children in conversations and direct them to the appropriate support services. “It’s the right medium, with the right vocabulary, so that we’re clearly understood by children who need support, without drawing the attention of the people who are mistreating them,” said Fabrice Plazolles of the marketing company Havas Sports and Entertainment, which managed the operation. “The lockdown meant that children didn’t have any other means of sounding the alarm, so it would have been disastrous if a parent discovered the project and took away the game,” he said. Morin said jumping into Fortnite, which has attracted 250 million registered players since its launch in 2017, had proved the potential of video games for reaching children where they congregate. The goal now is to establish a more permanent presence across more platforms. Starting in September, L’Enfant Bleu will form a working group with video game editors, judges and police officers specialized in child abuse, and France’s secretary of state for child protection to discuss the possibilities. “We hope to offer an additional tool for children so they can call for help, by taking their point of view,” Morin said. RGA RELATED STORIES:  WATCH: Young gamer streams ‘Fortnite’ to pay for dad’s cancer treatment

266;PVAC;Next step uncertain in Woody Allen allegations;Associated Press;Associated Press;Sun, 09 Feb 2014 15:33:51 PST;article;This Aug. 27, 2013 file photo shows director and actor Woody Allen at the French premiere of “Blue Jasmine,” in Paris. Allen is again denying he molested adoptive daughter Dylan Farrow and is calling ex-partner Mia Farrow vindictive, spiteful and malevolent in an open-letter published online Friday, Feb. 7, 2014 by The New York TimesAP NEW YORK — A week bracketed by op-ed letters of accusation and denial of child molestation left little clarity and scant hope for resolution in a bitter saga that has haunted Woody Allen and the Farrow family for more than two decades. The back-and-forth between Allen and his adopted daughter, Dylan Farrow, breathed new fire into a long dormant scandal, but what happens next is uncertain, with the possibility of legal recourse and continued scrutiny in the weeks and months ahead.  Farrow, in her most detailed account yet, alleged in an open letter published Feb. 1 by The New York Times that Allen “sexual assaulted” her when she was 7 years old at the Farrows’ Connecticut home, renewing a charge against the movie director that was first leveled in 1992. Allen responded in a letter posted online Friday night by the Times that insisted “of course I did not molest Dylan.” He instead claimed the young Dylan had been coerced and misled by her mother, Mia Farrow. The two acrimoniously separated after Farrow discovered Allen was having an affair with her adopted daughter Soon-Yi Previn, who was 19 or 21 at the time. (Her date of birth is uncertain.)  “I loved (Dylan) and hope one day she will grasp how she has been cheated out of having a loving father and exploited by a mother more interested in her own festering anger than her daughter’s well-being,” said Allen, who married Previn in 1997 and has two adopted daughters with her. Mia Farrow has yet to comment on Allen’s letter. Representatives for Farrow didn’t respond to messages left Friday night and Saturday.  Allen ended his letter by declaring it would be his “final word on this entire matter.” But the rampant debate sparked by Dylan Farrow’s accusation will likely continue to stir questions over the alleged molestation, how claims of sexual assault are publicly weighed, and the legacy of Allen’s acclaimed work as a filmmaker. Filing criminal charges would be difficult for Farrow. In Connecticut, Farrow had until age 20 to file charges. (She is now 28, married and living in Florida.) In 2002, Connecticut extended the cutoff to age 48, but that only covers crimes since the change. Exceptions can be made for the most serious sexual crimes. Connecticut state prosecutor Frank Maco, who investigated the charges in 1993 but is now retired, has said he believes the statute of limitations ran out on the case years ago. The history of the case is clouded by a 1993 investigation that was full of contradictions. Allen wasn’t charged and a team of child abuse specialists from the Yale-New Haven Hospital brought into the case by prosecutors concluded Dylan had not been molested. But Maco claimed there was “probable cause” for charging him. In the custody battle, Judge Elliott Wilk concluded Allen’s behavior with Dylan was “grossly inappropriate and that measures must be taken to protect her.”  Farrow could file a civil suit against Allen. Though a suit would offer the opportunity to retry the case in civil court, it would insure a drawn-out, very public battle that would be taxing for all involved. Even without further legal action, the public eye in which Allen and the Farrows operate will keep the matter in the headlines. Ronan Farrow, the 26-year-old son of Allen and Mia Farrow (though she has said Frank Sinatra could be the father), will start hosting his own show on MSNBC on Feb. 24. (Dylan’s brother, Moses, 36, has insisted Allen never molested Dylan.) Allen’s latest film, “Blue Jasmine,” is nominated for three Academy Awards. Though Allen, long an award-show absentee, won’t be at the March 2 Oscars, he could win his fifth Oscar for the screenplay to “Blue Jasmine.” The film’s star, Cate Blanchett, is generally considered the front-runner for best actress. It was the Golden Globes’ recent honoring of Allen for its Cecil B. DeMille lifetime achievement award that precipitated Dylan Farrow’s op-ed, which was largely aimed at the movie industry and fans of Allen for turning a blind eye to the director’s alleged molestation. But if the endgame of the situation is unclear, Dylan Farrow has suggested she’s already accomplished her goal. “If speaking out about my experience can help others stand up to their tormentors, it will be worth the pain and suffering my father continues to inflict on me,” Farrow said in a statement following Allen’s op-ed. “I won’t let the truth be buried and I won’t be silenced.”;;['Child Molestation', 'Dylan Farrow', 'Mia Farrow', 'Woody Allen'];https://entertainment.inquirer.net/134316/next-step-uncertain-in-woody-allen-allegations;19

Kathy Dela Calzada, project manager for Plan International, which has ongoing projects in Bogo City, said the community and the city government have been responsive in the campaign. “We will conduct more information drives for the local government and barangay officials,” she told Cebu Daily News. “When we reach the barangay level  then we can immediately tap the community, especially the parents,” she said.  Asked what help they can give, she said they can extend “fare transportation and medical-legal assistance for the children”  and would coordinate with the municipal social welfare office. Four minor girls, two from Bogo and two sisters from Consolacion town, were rescued by police, who arrested Levis Talbot in his rented room in the Gabrielle’s Court motel-pension house where the girls had spent the night A help desk to assist possible trafficked victims was launched at the Polambato Wharf  of Bogo just a week earlier. The busy port is a departure and arrival point for passengers going in and out of Bogo City, Leyte and Masbate. READ: Bogo forms anti-trafficking group after child sex cases So far, one family sought help after three siblings were illegally recruited in Bogo City last year, said Dela Calzada. “They were forced  to work somewhere in Central Visayas. The suspect is still at large after charges was filed against him,” she told Cebu Daily News. The four children rescued last April 7 are back “in their community” said   Dela Calzada, who declined to give more details. Bogo police earlier said there was no facility  or accredited shelter for children and had to turn the girls over to relatives. Inquest proceedings for the three suspects will be held tomorrow. Child abuse and human trafficking charges were filed by police in the Office of the City Prosecutor against  Talbot, and the 27-year-old mother and grandmother of two of the rescued girls. All three suspects are detained in the Bogo police jail. A 19-year-old sister of the rescued girls from  Bogo said  the family is consulting a lawyer. “Akong lola sige ug hilak tungod sa issue. Ang mga bata wala man ma trauma kay wala man sad nahitabo gud. Sige ra gani sila ug dula,” said the teenager, who’s been visiting her detained grandmother. (My grandmother is often crying because of the controversy.  The children are not suffering any trauma because nothing bad happened.  They are busy playing.) In an interview at the jail last Friday, the 63-year-old grandmother said Talbot has been a close family friend since 2008 and would stay in their house when he visits Bogo. READ: American retiree in trafficking, child abuse charges She denied any sexual abuse took place with her young granddaughters, and said Talbot was helping finance the repair of their house which was destroyed during super typhoon Yolanda in 2013. The grandmother blamed her daughter-in-law for calling the police, saying  the young woman was just irked that Talbot wouldn’t give her more than P20 when she asked for money because the foreigner knew she would use it to buy drugs. The lola  said she had to take over as breadwinner of the family since her son was in jail on drug charges and her daughter-in-law also had a drug habit. The arrest on April 7 took place a day after Bogo City Mayor Celestino Martinez Jr. formed a committee against human trafficking following a seminar conducted by Plan International. The NGO, which focuses on the rights and welfare of children, is part of the committee with policemen, barangay captains and members of the Baranga Peakeeping Action Team. Plan International recently donated computers, cameras, and other office supplies to  help Bogo City to help document cases of human trafficking. The NGO signed a Memorandum of Agreement with Bogo city to set up community-based mechanisms for anti-trafficking and disaster response.;No news category;No Tags;https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/54455/arrest-in-bogo-city-a-positive-response-says-ngo;23

643;PVAC;Diane Keaton opens up about age, marriage and Hollywood;Agence France-Presse;;Thu, 09 May 2019 20:20:41 PST;article;"Diane Keaton attended the premiere of STX Entertainment’s “Poms” in Los Angeles on May 1, 2019. Image: AFP/Robyn Beck Diane Keaton claimed to be one of the fortunate ones: as the screen legend reflects on age, marriage and nearly half a century of working in Hollywood, she said that she has never felt sexually harassed. “Never. Maybe I just [was not] harassment material,” said Keaton, who has 68 screen credits since her 1970 debut in the comedy “Lovers and Other Strangers”.  The 72-year-old’s big screen appearances include “The Godfather” (1972) and its sequels, two “Father of the Bride” movies in the 1990s with Steve Martin and “Something’s Gotta Give” with Jack Nicholson (2003), for which she won a Golden Globe. But the actress truly made her mark co-starring in eight Woody Allen movies, from “Play It Again Sam” (1972) to “Manhattan Murder Mystery” (1993). She won her best actress Oscar for starring in “Annie Hall” (1977) with Allen and was nominated a further three times. Keaton and Allen were lovers for a time, and when they broke up they remained friends and work partners.  As the Hollywood sexual harassment scandals detonated in late 2017, cascading from producer Harvey Weinstein to heavyweight actors like Kevin Spacey, old accusations of child sex abuse against Allen by his adoptive daughter Dylan resurfaced. “Woody Allen is my friend and I continue to believe him,” Keaton tweeted in January 2018.  For all her confidence and bravado, Keaton preferred simply not to talk about the controversial actor and director — and did not answer a question about whether she would work with him again. Age and love Keaton’s last two movies are about aging women: “Book Club” (2018), with its message that love has no age, and now “Poms”, set to open on Friday in the United States and Canada. “Poms” is the story of Martha, a terminally ill woman who moves to a retirement community to die, but winds up forming a cheerleading squad made up of female senior citizens. As for aging, Keaton says that life actually gets easier. “I think so, because what have you got to lose? It’s like it’s the truth. That’s what it is. You face it, we talk about it,” she said.  Keaton is less certain about spending her final years in a retirement home, but she definitely would not be a cheerleader like Martha in “Poms”. “I was never a dancer… and cheerleading is really basically dancing,” she said. She auditioned for a school cheerleading squad when she was 14 but did not make the cut. “Really my heart was in performing on stage,” she said. Keaton is familiar with the environment, having volunteered in her 30s at a Jewish retirement home, and she has a brother — the subject of a book she has just finished — at an assisted living facility. “So I know about them, I’ve been around,” she said. ‘I’m not unhappy’ Keaton, who enjoys photography when she is not acting, is in no rush to retire. “I don’t think of it,” she said. If the Hollywood work offers dry up, “I have a lot of hobbies that are very time-consuming that I love. I’ll address those and those will be my work. I have no intention of stopping any kind of work whatsoever,” she said. Keaton, who had long romances with screen legends like Al Pacino, Beatty and Allen, has two adopted children but never married. “I wonder if I’m the only single woman of my age who’s been in film who hasn’t gotten married, so I might be a freak,” she said. “Most people in the movies get married at some point and then they divorce. But I’ve never even got married. I am [a] failure,” she joked. Does she regret it? “I don’t think about it a lot but I’m aware of the fact that I’m unusual in that regard, and maybe I did miss out on something — but then, nobody can have everything, right?” “I’m not unhappy,” she said. CE/JB

648;PVAC;PNP: Antirape campaign should be gender-blind;Philippine Daily Inquirer;Jaymee T. Gamil;Sat, 21 Jul 2018 05:58:03 PST;article;PNP Spokesperson Sr. Supt. Benigno Durana. INQUIRER.net file photo A day after the Angono police apologized for posting antirape tips that were regarded as putting the blame on victims, the Philippine National Police said it would be “updating” its anticriminality guidelines. In a statement on Friday, Senior Supt. Benigno Durana, PNP spokesperson, said that while the Angono police had “good initiative” and “meant well,” he cited the need for “gender-blind self-education” to become part of rape prevention campaigns.  “Both men and women ought to know that no means no, that rape is a serious crime, and that they can go to jail if they violate another person’s human rights,” he added. According to Durana, “the updated rape prevention guidelines should include early education of male and female teenagers on rape as a crime, and raising awareness of newer and more dangerous date-rape drugs such as GHB, MDMA and ecstasy.”  From July 2017 to June this year, the PNP recorded a total of 6,999 rape cases, although this was lower by 23.96 percent compared to the 9,204 cases recorded from July 2016 to June 2017. Earlier, the Angono police took down the rape prevention tips posted on its official Facebook page following widespread criticism from netizens, women’s groups and public officials at what they viewed as “victim-blaming.”  Controversial tips  Among the tips perceived as laying the blame squarely on victims were the following: Don’t wear short dresses. Don’t walk by yourself in a dark place. If you’re going on a date, don’t drink alcohol.  Earlier this week, Sen. Risa Hontiveros pointed out that “clothes don’t cause rape, rapists do.” “While the intention of the information material may be good, it promotes victim-blaming by asking women to conform to a particular way of dressing in order to be respected and avoid being raped,” she said in a statement. Educate the public “Instead of ‘teaching’ women how to dress ‘appropriately’ and limit our choices, our police force should help in educating the public, especially men, that forcing themselves upon women is unacceptable and constitutes rape,” she added. Gabriela party-list Rep. Arlene Brosas also called the post a “classic case of victim-blaming and gross misinformation on rape.” In a statement, the Angono police said it only wanted women to avoid becoming victims of sexual assault. “As they say, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,” it added. Supt. Ruben Piquero, Angono police chief, said the antirape post was lifted from leaflets being distributed by his men as part of their anticrime awareness program. ;Headlines;['Angono police', 'anti-rape', 'Metro', 'news', '\u200eRape'];https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1012459/pnp-antirape-campaign-should-be-gender-blind;6
1019;PVAC;Angono ‘rape reminder’ a classic case of victim-blaming – Gabriela;INQUIRER.net;Pathricia Ann V. Roxas;Wed, 18 Jul 2018 16:31:10 PST;article;"Gabriela Rep. Arlene Brosas urged the Angono, Rizal Municipal Police Station on Wednesday to take down the “rape reminder” it posted on Facebook as it puts the blame on women, not the sex offenders. The progressive lawmaker assailed Angono Philippine National Police (PNP)’s post as “a classic case of victim-blaming and gross misinformation on rape.”  “This rotten mindset being perpetrated by the state authorities themselves certainly emboldens perpetrators to commit rape and further puts women in a difficult situation. And the President’s machismo and misogyny feed into this rape culture,” she added in a statement. Angono police’s Facebook post on how to prevent rape drew flak on social media on Tuesday as many called it out for victim-blaming.   Brosas likewise corrected the Angono police: “short skirts and drinking don’t cause rape; rapists do cause rape.”  The lawmaker also questioned how women can ask for assistance from the same uniformed personnel “who execute strip shows and gang rape inside their precincts.” Brosas said they would formally write the Angona PNP to take down its public advisory and to attend their gender sensitivity and anti-violence against women and their children (anti-VAWC) training.  /vvp READ: Angono police draw flak over ‘how to prevent rape’ FB post ";Nation;['Angono', 'Gabriela', 'Philippine news updates', 'PNP\u200e', 'rape reminder'];https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1011640/angono-rape-reminder-a-classic-case-of-victim-blaming-gabriela;8
1250;PVAC;De lima wants age of sexual consent raised to 18;Philippine Daily Inquirer;Leila B. Salaverria;Fri, 31 Aug 2018 06:05:10 PST;article;Senator Leila de Lima A 12-year-old cannot knowledgeably consent to sex, according to Senator Leila de Lima. For this reason, she has filed a bill to raise the age of sexual consent from 12 to 18 years old, in order to protect the youth from rape and sexual predators.  In her bill, De Lima said it was necessary to look into the realities faced by a 12-year-old in the country. At this age, a child has barely gone through puberty and hardly knows about sexual intercourse because there is no sex education in schools.  They are also not allowed to get condoms and other forms of contraception, she noted. Immature, unstable  A 12-year-old, De Lima said, has yet to develop physical, psychological and emotional maturity and stability. “Allowing our children at the tender age of 12 years old to decide on their own whether the time is proper to engage in sexual intercourse will be like abandoning them blindfolded in a tunnel of mazes,” she added in her explanatory note. According to De Lima, the Philippines has one of the lowest ages of consent, next to Nigeria which as of 2015 was 11. In most countries, the average age of consent is between 16 and 18 years old. Her bill seeks to amend the Revised Penal Code to state that rape is committed when the woman is under 18 years old. De Lima said this would protect the youth’s innocence.;Headlines;['Age', 'innocence', 'Leila de Lima', 'Local news', 'Nation', 'national news', 'news', 'Philippine news updates', 'Predators', '\u200eRape', 'Regions', 'Revised Penal Code', 'sexual consent', 'youth protection'];https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1026779/de-lima-wants-age-of-sexual-consent-raised-to-18;3

Lopez’s suspension Monday comes days after four women filed a lawsuit in federal court accusing USA Taekwondo and the U.S. Olympic Committee of sex trafficking. The lawsuit alleges the organizations were long aware that Lopez and his brother were sexual predators but kept sending young women with them to competitions and practices.  Jean Lopez is appealing a pair of violations for sexual misconduct that resulted in a permanent ban; one of the cases involved a minor. Last June, USA Today reported that two women had accused Steven Lopez of sexual assault. Lopez denied the allegations.

1254;PVAC;Exploitation with consent—and accommodation;Philippine Daily Inquirer;Nestor U. Torre;Sun, 07 Jan 2018 00:25:04 PST;article;Our series of columns on sexual predators in Hollywood who were recently unmasked and defanged has prompted some viewers to wonder about the status of their counterparts on the local scene. Why have their nefarious activities not raised a similar hue and cry for instant exposure, defanging and reforms?  Fact is, there have been just as many local victims over the years and decades but only a few have stepped out of the shadows and courageously pointed fingers—and named names. This relative lack of accusers speaks volumes about the clammy, curdling climate of exploitation, power-tripping and accommodation that rules the rancid underbelly of show biz in these parts.  The name of the local game is: exploitation with consent—and benefits. The gossip grapevine is weighed down with sordid stories of teen starlets successfully reduced or “bought with stardom” by savvy senior predators who know what they want, and are powerful enough to give it to them—with alacrity!  The “exploitation with benefits” game became standard practice in the ’60s and ’70s, when bomba (sex) flicks ruled the local movie screen, topbilling total unknowns whose only claim to fame was their lack of shame—and inhibitions. Sadly, some of those overnight sensations had to take drugs to force themselves to perform the “extreme” exhibitionistic antics required of them. Saddest of all was the fate of some starlets who, after “putting out,” still didn’t get to savor and enjoy the stardom promised them. And their powerful exploiters got off scot-free. Insiders in the ’70s also whispered about popular stars who were themselves doing the exploiting and promising.  They gossiped about the existence of hotel rooms where stars would regularly bring starlets or even gaga fans for some bedroom encounters—not always with mutual consent. The nefarious practice even figured in some criminal cases, most shockingly in the rape and death of a sexy starlet. A unique aspect of the local “exploitation” scene in show biz is its strong gay component. Since many producers and directors swish, their victims are male starlets, who obligingly put out to get ahead. Indeed, a veteran insider “educatedly” guesses that, of 10 male screen luminaries today, half have gone the “obliging” route to stardom. Bolstering that cynical view is our recollection of interviewing a famous film power broker who ticked off the names of many action stars, and smilingly revealed that all of them had “visited” his “casting couch” before they made it big. The victims being male, they appear to think that they’ve lost less than their female counterparts in the “explo” exchange, so they generally don’t make a big deal about it—which is why their exploiters continue to prey on fresh batches of clueless, obliging hopefuls—to this day.;Celebrities and Showbiz;['exploitation', 'Hollywood', 'sexual predators'];https://entertainment.inquirer.net/256923/exploitation-consent-accommodation;4
