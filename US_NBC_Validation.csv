OVAC;1;1;"OKLAHOMA CITY — A former Republican state senator in Oklahoma was sentenced to 15 years in federal prison Monday on a child sex trafficking charge. U.S. District Judge Timothy DeGiusti handed down the sentence to Ralph Shortey, 36, who faced sentences of between 10 years and life in prison. DeGiusti also ordered Shortey to serve 10 years of supervised probation once he is released from prison and said he will impose a fine on the former two-term lawmaker at a later date. The fine could be up to $250,000. Shortey pleaded guilty in November in exchange for prosecutors dropping three child pornography charges against him. He said at the time that the plea deal was in the best interest of him and his family. This site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service Shortey was arrested in March 2017 after police found him in a suburban Oklahoma City motel room with a then-17-year-old boy. Police were acting on a tip from the teen's father when they went to the motel and said they smelled marijuana coming from the room. Police accused the married father of four of hiring the teen for sex. Shortey resigned shortly after the arrest. His wife obtained a divorce earlier this year. A police report indicated a search of the teen's tablet computer uncovered a series of sexually explicit exchanges in which Shortey referred to the teen as ""baby boy"" and offered him cash in exchange for ""sexual stuff."" The FBI also found that Shortey had previously used fake names to send and receive child pornography and to go on Craigslist to seek casual encounters with males, the ""younger the better."" Shortey was twice elected in a district covering south Oklahoma City and parts of two suburbs."
OVAC;0;1;"A federal jury took just hours to convict a New York man on Wednesday on multiple charges of running a cult-like group that kept women as virtual sex prisoners to service him. In less than one full day of deliberations, the Brooklyn panel found Keith Raniere, 58, guilty of racketeering, sex trafficking and possession of child pornographyrelated to NXIVM (pronounced ""nexium"") — a purported self-help organization that he ran near Albany. Within NXIVM, he created a secret sorority called DOS in which female ""slaves"" turned over compromising materials that were used to blackmail and force them into sex, prosecutors said. Raniere faces up to life behind bars. He's scheduled to be sentenced on Sept. 25. U.S. Attorney Richard P. Donoghue thanked his prosecutors, the law enforcement, jurors and the judge for Wednesday's verdict. “Thanks to these efforts of these many participants, Keith Raniere's crime spree has ended and his victims will finally see justice,"" he told reporters outside court. Actress Catherine Oxenberg, whose daughter is a former member of NXIVM, said Wednesday's verdict allayed her fears that Raniere ""would get away with murder again as he has done in the past."" “I had to save a child who was caught in the grips of this cult,"" said the ""Dynasty"" actress, who penned a book about her NXIVM experience, ""Captive: A Mother's Crusade to Save Her Daughter from a Terrifying Cult."" ""I wasn’t going to stop until I succeeded.""

""Keith has said to me, `The next time I see you, you'll be dead or in jail,’ "" Natalie said outside court. ""Well I’m alive and he’s in jail and it looks like for life. He didn’t win."" Several of Raniere's cohorts, such as ""Smallville"" actress Allison Mack, had already pleaded guilty. Mack, 36, is facing up to 40 years in prison after she admitted to committing offenses that included extortion and forced labor in her role as a high-ranking member of NXIVM.

""His crimes and the crimes of his co-conspirators ruined marriages, careers, fortunes and lives,"" Donoghue said. ""The evidence proved that Raniere was truly a modern day Svengali."" Defense lawyer Marc Agnifilo said he was disappointed that the jury didn't take longer to deliberate or acquit his client on at least some charges. But he added: ""I hope that people find peace and solace in the verdict."" Jurors heard from multiple women who testified that they were the defendant's sex slaves and were branded with the initials of Raniere, who was called their ""supreme master."" Lauren Salzman testified that she and her co-defendants brainwashed women and pushed them to be obedient. A written instruction for sorority members was, ""You should be a hungry dog for your master,"" according to Lauren Salzman. The organization collected nude pictures and other compromising material of female members and called it ""collateral"" that would ensure their silence, according to witnesses and prosecutors. One witness said she was told to seduce Raniere in 2015, and couldn't refuse because another woman who was her ""master"" had collected embarrassing material from her. The so-called collateral included a letter written to her parents where she falsely claimed she was a prostitute.

OVAC;0;1;"A ""vast trove of lewd photographs"" of young-looking women or girls was confiscated from the New York City home of Jeffrey Epstein, federal prosecutors revealed Monday after a newly unsealed indictment accused the multimillionaire financier of exploiting a ""vast network"" of underage victims for sex. Epstein, 66, is accused of seeking out minors, some as young as 14, from at least 2002 through 2005 and paying them hundreds of dollars in cash for sex at either his Manhattan townhouse or his estate in Palm Beach, Florida. He is being charged with one count of sex trafficking conspiracy and one count of sex trafficking. He faces up to 45 years in prison if found guilty. During a federal court appearance Monday afternoon in Manhattan, Epstein wore a blue jumpsuit and pleaded not guilty to the charges against him. Federal prosecutor Alex Rossmiller, in arguing against granting him bail, told the judge that Epstein is ""extraordinarily wealthy"" and a flight risk because he has the means to flee. He also accused Epstein of witness intimidation, including ""forcing off the road a father of one of the victims."" Reid Weingarten, an attorney for Epstein, told the judge that ""the risk of flight is dramatically overstated."" Weingarten added that the new indictment is ""essentially a do-over"" and ""this is old stuff."" ""We do know we're talking about ancient conduct and about ancient facts,"" he added. A decision on Epstein's bail was delayed and he must remain behind bars until at least Monday, July 15. The defense will file a proposed bail package on Thursday, July 11, and prosecutors will respond by 5 p.m. Friday. He is scheduled to appear in court at 10 a.m. on July 15 for a bail hearing. At an earlier news conference, U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York appealed for other potential victims to come forward while appearing to take a swipe at prosecutors in South Florida, where Epstein has previously been accused of molesting young girls and where he worked out a favorable deal following an arrest in 2005 related to accusations of sex with minors. He said that although these new charges stem from older allegations, seeking justice ""is still profoundly important to the many alleged victims — now young women. They deserve their day in court."" This site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service FBI Assistant Director William Sweeney Jr. added that people have been making excuses for wealthy predators and there has been a ""willful blindness over who the real villains are in this type of outrageous crime."" According to the indictment, Epstein would initially ask his victims for ""massages,"" which would be done by the girls either fully or partially nude, and then become ""increasingly sexual in nature."" He would then pay his victims to recruit additional girls, federal prosecutors said. ""In so doing, Epstein maintained a steady supply of new victims to exploit,"" according to the indictment filed in the Southern District of New York, which added that unidentified ""employees and associates"" would communicate with victims to arrange the sexual encounters in Manhattan. He is accused of having a similar setup in Florida. Epstein, a hedge fund manager who has powerful political connections that include President Donald Trump and former President Bill Clinton, was arrested without incident at an airport in Teterboro, New Jersey, on Saturday after flying in from Paris. Investigators later raided his home, and he was being held in a New York jail. Clinton's team released a statement Monday detailing four trips Clinton took with Epstein on the billionaire's plane between 2002 and 2003 in connection with the Clinton Foundation's work in Europe, Asian and Africa. The former president said he knew nothing of Epstein's ""terrible crimes."" ""He’s not spoken to Epstein in well over a decade, and has never been to Little St. James Island, Epstein’s ranch in New Mexico, or his residence in Florida,"" the statement said. Statement on Jeffrey Epstein. pic.twitter.com/98ha9YYd1l Epstein's arrest is part of a larger investigation by the Southern District of New York's Public Corruption Unit, multiple people briefed on the matter earlier told NBC News. The latest case against Epstein has also returned scrutiny to his previous arrest by Palm Beach police, when investigators sought to charge him and two assistants with crimes tied to his sexual behavior with underage females at his home. Palm Beach investigators interviewed five alleged victims and 17 witnesses, according to the police files. The investigative files alleged Epstein brought the girls to his house under the guise that they would give him massages, which police said would turn sexual. Epstein, however, was able to make a non-prosecution agreement with prosecutors in 2008 that allowed him to dodge more serious charges by federal authorities and a potential life sentence. Instead, Epstein pleaded guilty to state charges of procuring a person under 18 for prostitution and felony solicitation of prostitution, which required him to register as a sex offender and serve about a year in jail, most of it in work release. The deal was widely criticized as too lenient, and was worked out by attorneys for Epstein and agreed to by former Miami U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta, who is now Trump's labor secretary. Acosta did not respond to a request for comment from NBC News, but has previously defended the deal, telling a House Appropriations subcommittee in April that Epstein had to go to jail. Epstein's accusers, who say they were not told of the agreement in advance, are suing to have it thrown out. In February, a federal judge ruled that the Florida prosecutors led by Acosta had violated federal law by failing to notify the accusers of the agreement. But the Justice Department filed court papers last month that contend Epstein's plea deal cannot be legally challenged because he has complied with its terms. The accusers have until Monday to respond to the federal filing. Despite the agreement, Berman said his team is still able to go after Epstein on other charges because the deal is limited to only the Miami area, including Palm Beach, and New York prosecutors are ""not bound"" by it. Prosecutors can also seek to charge him for alleged conduct from about 14 years ago because Congress did away with the statute of limitations for child sex trafficking more than a decade ago. Paul Cassell, an attorney for four of Epstein's accusers, said in a statement Saturday that his latest arrest ""proves that Epstein should have been charged by federal prosecutors 12 years ago in Florida."" Epstein has addresses on his own island in St. Thomas, the Upper East Side in Manhattan, Paris, New Mexico, and Palm Beach, according to his sex offender registration in the Florida Department of Law Enforcement index. The latest charges don't mean the investigation is over either: the FBI searched his Manhattan townhouse Saturday and recovered documents, and additional accusers might also come forward.

Martin was 15 at the time of the slaying. Martin collaborated with a female friend and two men to rob the home of her pimp, Angelo Kerney, in Akron, Ohio, according to court documents. Though Martin was not accused of firing a gun, the documents state she and the other female distracted Kerney ""with dancing and sex."" Kerney was killed in the shooting. Martin's forced prostitution was cited as a factor leading to her involvement in the fatal shooting. Martin pleaded guilty to aggravated murder and other charges and was sentenced to 21 years to life in prison. In 2018, Martin appealed her sentence arguing her history as a sex trafficking victim was not properly explored by a juvenile judge during a hearing that determined if she should be charged as an adult. The court upheld her conviction in a 6-1 vote, the Associated Press reported. Her story became a cause celebre among advocates of criminal justice reform, including Kardashian West, who has become a force in the world of criminal justice reform. The Oxygen documentary revealed that while in prison, Martin earned her GED, became a certified dog trainer and ran a group for survivors of human trafficking. Kardashian West tweeted about DeWine's decision Friday, writing: ""Alexis Martin is a sex traffic survivor and I was honored to be able to share her story on the Justice Project. Thank you Governor DeWine for commuting her sentence."" Kardashian West has advocated for the release of numerous inmates, most notably Alice Marie Johnson who was sent to prison for life in federal court in Tennessee in 1996 for attempted possession of cocaine and conspiracy to possess cocaine.

OVAC;0;1;"Billionaire convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was arrested Saturday in connection with federal sex trafficking allegations, law enforcement officials said. The arrest stems from incidents spanning from 2002 to 2005, three law enforcement officials said. Epstein, 66, of Palm Beach, Florida, had flown from Paris to New York when he was arrested in Teterboro, New Jersey, the officials said. The arrest was part of a joint NYPD and FBI investigation. The New York Police Department, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and the FBI declined to comment. The Epstein case was led by SDNY’s Public Corruption Unit, working with the sex crimes division, according to a source familiar with the investigation. Three senior law enforcement officials confirm that Jeffrey Epstein was in custody at Teterboro airport in New Jersey earlier today after flying into the U.S. on an overseas flight. Separately, a senior law enforcement official briefed on the case says that Epstein is expected to face two federal charges for ""dozens"" of victims. This site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service The official says, Epstein allegedly paid minors cash for massages and then sex acts. He would then allegedly pay those alleged victims even more money to bring him their friends/others who he would also allegedly pay for acts. The official says that some victims are as young as 14 years old. These acts allegedly occurred at his Upper East Side and Palm Beach, Florida homes. Multiple people briefed on the matter say that the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York's public corruption unit is prosecuting the case. The Daily Beast first reported the hedge fund manager's arrest. Epstein came under renewed scrutiny after his lawyer made a secret deal with prosecutors in 2008 that allowed him to plead guilty to lesser charges after federal authorities pursued him for allegedly having sex with multiple underage victims. Epstein, who was friends with the likes of Bill Clinton, Donald Trump and Prince Andrew, wound up pleading guilty in 2008 to state charges of soliciting a single underage victim after federal prosecutors agreed to shelve their case and not prosecute him or his enablers. Former Miami U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta, who is now President Donald Trump's labor secretary, helped to put the deal together. In the face of intense criticism, Acosta has defended the plea deal as appropriate under the circumstances, The Associated Press reported. Acosta's office also agreed not to tell the victims about the nonprosecution agreement. In February U.S. District Judge Kenneth A. Marra said in a 33-three page ruling that prosecutors violated the victims' rights by not informing them of the deal. On Saturday Paul G. Cassell, attorney for four of Epstein's accusers, said in a statement that his arrest ""proves that Epstein should have been charged by federal prosecutors twelve years ago in Florida."" ""With his money, Epstein was able to buy more than a decade of delay in facing justice — but fortunately he wasn’t able to postpone justice forever,"" Cassell said. U.S. Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Nebraska, who's chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Oversight, Agency Action, Federal Rights and Federal Courts, welcomed news of Epstein's arrest.

OVAC;0;0;"The U.S. Catholic Church spent $10.6 million on lobbyists to prevent victims of clerical sex abuse from suing for damages. According to a new report, the money was doled out from 2011 through 2018 in eight northeastern states where bills to reform statute of limitations laws were either in the works or being considered. “This report lays out what we have known all along — that the Catholic Church refuses to take responsibility for the decades of abuse that took place knowingly under its watch,” said attorney Stephen Weiss, who works for one of the law firms that commissioned the study. “Statute of limitations reforms give survivors more time to obtain some measure of closure on the atrocities committed against them,” attorney Gerald Williams added. “The church has yet to implement meaningful reforms, and by working to prevent these laws from passing, the church is clearly demonstrating that it does not stand with survivors.” In Pennsylvania, where currently victims of child sex abuse can come forward with criminal allegations until the age of 50 and can file civil claims until age 30, the church spent $5,322,979 to keep those limitations in place, according to the report, “Church Influencing State: How the Catholic Church Spent Millions Against Survivors of Clergy Abuse.” The report was commissioned by Seeger Weiss LLP, Williams Cedar LLC, Abraham Watkins and the Simpson Tuegel Law Firm, which collectively represent 300 survivors of clergy sex abuse nationwide. The data in the report was obtained from public filings in the individual states. Attorney General Josh Shapiro, whose blockbuster grand jury report last year identified 301 “predator priests” in six dioceses who were alleged to have abused more than 1,000 children, has been leading the charge to lift those statutes of limitations. “The extensive lobbying by the Catholic Church in Pennsylvania against the reforms recommended by the Grand Jury proves what I have said all along: the Church cannot be trusted to police itself,” Shapiro said. “It’s reprehensible that the Church continues to spend significant sums of money fighting these reforms, instead of protecting and supporting the victims of clergy sexual abuse.” The Pennsylvania Catholic Conference and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops did not return an NBC News request for comment. In New York, the church spent $2,912,772 in what ultimately was a failed bid to prevent the passage of the Child Victims Act, which Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed into law on Feb. 14. It allows child sexual abuse victims to sue their abuser or institutions until age 55. Previously the cutoff was age 23. This site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service Of that money, 80 percent went to the Catholic Conference Policy Group Inc., which was tasked with lobbying on “statute of limitations, legislative issues and liability issues,” the report found. “I think it’s incredibly troubling that parishioners who on Sundays contributed to the church collections may have been inadvertently funding lobbying efforts against victims of sex abuse seeking legal redress,” New York State Sen. Brad Hoylman, who championed the Child Victims Act, said. “Three million dollars that went for lobbying could have done a lot of good elsewhere, including soup kitchens, after-school programs for children, support for seniors. In my district, a Catholic school that is closing might perhaps have stayed open if that money had been used for better causes.” Shortly before the New York state Legislature took up the Child Victims Act, Cardinal Timothy Dolan called in an op-ed published in The New York Daily News for measures that would avoid “breaking” the Roman Catholic Church. In an email to NBC News, Dennis Poust, a spokesman for the New York State Catholic Conference, said: “All of our lobbying activity is reported as required by law to the Joint Commission on Public Ethics and has always been publicly available.” “As far as the Child Victims Act, while we did raise concerns about the one-year look back, ultimately when sponsors amended the bill at our request to provide an opportunity for recourse to survivors in public institutions, the Catholic Conference dropped its opposition this year,” he wrote. When asked for comment, New York Diocese spokesman Joseph Zwilling referred NBC News to Poust. In Connecticut, where advocates for victims of priest sex abuse are presently pushing for the elimination of statutes of limitations for major sex crimes, the church spent $875,261, according to the report. The report also said the church spent $633,458 in New Jersey where Gov. Phil Murphy last month signed legislation that allows child victims to sue up until they turn 55 or “within seven years of their first realization that the abuse caused them harm,” according to The Associated Press. During that time period, the church spent $537,551 in Massachusetts, $124,260 in Maine, and $61,961 in Rhode Island. ""That is completely inaccurate,"" said James Driscoll, executive director of the Massachusetts Catholic Conference. ""I have no idea where the writer of this report came up with this figure. They never checked with me for any input before they wrote this report."" And in New Hampshire, where legislation to lift or amend the statute of limitations has yet to be introduced, the church has spent $134,345, according to the report. Tom Bebbington, a spokesman for the Diocese of Manchester, said it ""advocates before the state legislature on issues of importance for the good of all citizens including abortion, assisted suicide, education, preventing human trafficking, and repeal of the death penalty."" ""The services of lobbying professionals were used during the time period of this report for advocacy on all of these issues and more, but no lobbyist was engaged to advocate on behalf of the Diocese on statute of limitations legislation,"" he insisted. David Clohessy, the former director of the Survivor Network of those Abused by Priests, or SNAP, said church funds should never be used to fight clerical abuse victims. ""It's appalling that parishioners' donations are used to keep child sex crimes -- and those who committed and concealed them -- covered up,"" said Clohessy. ""There's no better indication of how bishops think and act than where they put their flocks' funds. And there are few more egregious and reckless ways to spend churchgoers' contributions than to put their kids at risk by fighting secular reforms that help expose predators."" Asked if he believes the church was willing to spend that kind of money on lobbyists because it feared payouts for victims would cost 10 times more, Weiss said that appears to be the case. “The church made the soulless decision to spend 10 million of its dollars to evade its responsibility to those harmed by clergy abuse, rather that use those funds toward the healing process,” he said. “Clearly these expenditures were aimed at protecting the church’s financial interests, not at doing the right thing.” Corky Siemaszko is a senior writer for NBC News Digital."

OVAC;0;0;"The long and bitter battle for legislation that would allow New York sex abuse victims to sue the Roman Catholic Church and other organizations for monetary damages ended with victory Monday when the state Senate passed the Child Victims Act. The vote was 63 to nothing, a spokeswoman for one of the bill's sponsors, state Sen. Brad Hoylman, said. The new law does away with the statutes of limitations that have prevented some alleged abuse victims from going to court to seek damages. And it includes a one-year “look-back window” that will allow others who weren’t able to sue in the past to file fresh claims. “Passage of the Child Victims Act is an exhilarating and empowering moment for those of us who have been waging this battle in Albany for a dozen years,” Stephen Jimenez, a sex abuse survivor and advocate for other victims, said after the vote. The Democratic-controlled Assembly was also expected to pass the measure later Monday and Gov. Andrew Cuomo was expected to sign the bill, which was sponsored by Hoylman and Assemblywoman Linda Rosenthal, both Manhattan Democrats. “Today, in passing the Child Victims Act, we are finally telling the survivors: The State of New York and the full force of its law is behind you, and you will not be turned away,” Hoylman said in a statement. This site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service “This is a historic day for New York as lawmakers choose children over predators,” Rosenthal added. Under the new legislation, child sexual abuse survivors will be permitted to sue their abuser or institutions until age 55, up from the current age of 23. Also, those abused at a public institution will no longer be required to file a notice of claim as a condition to filing a lawsuit. Cardinal Timothy Dolan, who as archbishop of New York leads more than 2 million Catholics, had bitterly opposed the legislation arguing that it could bankrupt the church. But after the vote, the New York State bishops issued a statement saying, ""We pray that the passage of the Child Victims Act brings some measure of healing to all survivors by offering them a path of recourse and reconciliation."" ""The legislation now recognizes that child sexual abuse is an evil not just limited to one institution, but a tragic societal ill that must be addressed in every place where it exists,"" it adds. The Child Victims Act championed by Hoylman and Rosenthal passed in the New York state Assembly by wide margins in 2017 and 2018. But it was blocked each time in the state Senate by the Republican majority. After the Democrats regained the Senate majority last year and took power, Dolan waved the white flag ahead of Monday’s vote and called for a measure that avoids “breaking” the church. “The emphasis must be on helping them heal, not breaking government, educational, health, welfare or religious organizations,” Dolan wrote in an op-ed this month in The New York Daily News. Mitchell Garabedian, whose work on behalf of Boston clerical sex abuse victims were dramatized in the Oscar-winning movie ""Spotlight,"" said this legislation was long overdue. ""With the passage of the Child Victims Act by the New York Legislature there is now hope for justice, respect and validation for thousands of sexual abuse victims sexually abused in New York,"" he said.

Statute of limitations laws vary from state to state, according to Child USA, a think tank dedicated to preventing child abuse.

Even worse, when she finally told her family a couple of years later that she had been in a sexual relationship with an older man at age 14, she says they accused her of flirting, and have since stopped talking to her because they view her as a ""spiritual threat"" to their own commitment to their faith. ""They were willing to turn their back on their own child to pursue a religion rather than support their own child,"" she said. Other former Jehovah's Witnesses say they have experienced a pattern of covering up abuse to protect the religion's reputation dating back decades. ""There's no list of questions or protocols. These men are literally flying by the seat of their pants. They're not cops or welfare workers,"" said William Bowen, a former elder who now serves as an expert witness on how Jehovah's Witnesses operate with respect to allegations of sexual abuse. Bowen is also the national director of Silentlambs, a victims' support group where abuse survivors who have gotten kicked out of the religion anonymously share their stories. He says he has collected more than 1,000 stories on the website since he started it in 2001. Chessa Manion, 29, describes the abuse she saw within the religious organization as ""systemic."" She says she was raped by the teenage son of an elder in 1994 in Illinois when she was five years old, and when her parents told elders what had happened, their response was: ""Let bygones be bygones for Jehovah's sake. Don't ruin his name by taking this public."" ""I feel that their first interest is not for the victim. It's for themselves,"" Manion said. ""It's really this culture of silencing and of cleaning things up and of tolerance."" Smith's attorney, Irwin Zalkin, whose San Diego law firm has been litigating against Jehovah's Witnesses across the country for nearly two decades, expects to file a civil lawsuit in the coming month on her behalf. He says the suit will claim negligence on the part of Jehovah's Witnesses for how they process child sex abuse claims such as Smith's. It will seek financial compensation and an overhaul of the religion's response to victims. ""At some point, they have to understand that this is not tolerable in a civilized society,"" Zalkin said. ""She was the one who they, in essence, prosecuted."" Smith said she hopes that by taking legal action, she will prevent what happened to her from happening to other Jehovah's Witness children. ""It is absolutely an environment where the abuser is set up to abuse again,"" she said. ""They are putting children at risk all the time because of the lack of action on the part of the organization. They do not have things in place to get these dangerous people out of the midst of their children."""
OVAC;0;1;"A doctor who treated America's Olympic gymnasts and has been accused of molesting dozens of his patients was arrested and charged Monday with criminal sexual conduct against a child, court records show. Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette is set to announce details of the three counts against Dr. Larry Nassar at a press conference on Tuesday. But court records show the allegations date to 1998 and involve a victim under the age of 13. Nassar's lawyer, Matt Newburg, had no immediate comment on the charges but previously said all of Nassar's procedures were medically appropriate. Nassar was the team doctor for USA Gymnastics, the sport's governing body, from 1996 to 2015 — when he was fired in response to what the organization has called ""athlete concerns."" This site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service USA Gymnastics reported Nassar to the FBI at the time but it's not clear what action was taken. Nassar, 53, continued to teach and treat patients at Michigan State University, where he had his sports medicine practice until being fired Sept. 20. Since the first allegations against Nassar were reported by the Indianapolis Star two months ago, at least two dozen former patients have filed complaints at Michigan State, alleging they were sexually assaulted under the guise of invasive medical exams. Schuette took over the probe last month, and it's not clear if the charges filed this week represent the end of his investigation or just the start. Nassar also faces lawsuits by two former gymnasts — one an Olympic medalist, the other a former national team member who says she was repeatedly molested by him at the training facility operated by famed coach Bela Karolyi. One of Nassar's accusers, Rachael Denhollander, the only woman to go public thus far, said the charges give her hope. ""I’m heartbroken for his victims. And I’m heartbroken that that’s the man he is,"" she said. ""I’m grateful it's coming out. And I’m hopeful that justice will finally come for him,"" she added. ""I’m hopeful that justice will come for everything he’s done. For all of his victims. ""The reason I came forward is I wanted him to be stopped. And I think that’s being accomplished.""

In addition to members of the Olympic teams, Nassar has also treated members of America's national teams, regional gymnasts, and athletes in other sports. He was affiliated with a gym in Lansing, Michigan, and with the high school in his hometown of Holt, Michigan, which has cut ties with him.

OVAC;1;1;"A Kentucky man whose state prison sentence for a 2014 sexual assault was commuted last year by former Gov. Matt Bevin has been arrested on federal child pornography charges, authorities said Tuesday. In a statement, federal prosecutors in the Western District of Kentucky said Dayton Jones, 24, faces one charge of producing child sex abuse material. The charge carries a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison. Jones had been serving 15 years for the state charges. The crimes alleged Tuesday stem from the same 2014 sexual assault. In an earlier case brought by local prosecutors, Jones pleaded guilty to state charges, including sodomy and the distribution of material depicting sexual performance of a minor. Local authorities said Jones and several other people assaulted a 15-year-old boy with a sex toy while he was unconscious at a party in Hopkinsville, in Kentucky's southwest corner. The victim's colon was punctured and his bladder was injured in an assault that was recorded and uploaded to Snapchat, NBC affiliate WAVE of Louisville reported. Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politics This site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service Bevin, a Republican, commuted Jones' sentence in December after he was lobbied by Christian County Commonwealth's Attorney Rick Boling, The Associated Press reported. Boling later apologized for the letter and asked forgiveness for the ""embarrassment that I have caused this community,"" according to the AP. Bevin said he commuted Jones' sentence because he believed there was ""zero"" evidence linking him to the crime except for the ""testimony of kids who were getting a better deal by throwing [him] under the bus,"" the Courier-Journal newspaper of Louisville reported. Tuesday's statement from U.S. Attorney Russell Coleman did not mention the commutation. ""This prosecution is about one thing and one thing only, Mr. Jones' conduct in harming someone's child in the Western District of Kentucky in violation of federal law,"" Coleman said. Federal prosecutors allege that Jones created the video and shared it with others on social media. It was unclear whether Jones, who is in custody, has legal representation. A lawyer who has represented him in the past, Darren Wolff, said he was disappointed by the charges. ""This is the same set of facts,"" he told NBC News. ""This is an abuse of the system."" Bevin, who lost to Democrat Andy Beshear in November, pardoned or commuted the sentences of hundreds of people before he left office in December, including those of a child rapist and a convicted killer. The pardons drew outrage from victims' families and lawmakers. Senate Minority Floor Leader Morgan McGarvey, a Democrat, said they showed a ""shocking lack of judgment"" and were a potential ""abuse of our system of justice."" Bevin has defended the commutations and pardons, saying America is a nation of second chances. ""The myriad statements and suggestions that financial or political considerations played a part in the decision making process, are both highly offensive and entirely false,"" he tweeted in December.

OVAC;1;1;"On a cool evening in October, Alain Malcolm, 20, walked into a vacant two-story colonial house in Bristol, Connecticut. Two members of a local internet vigilante group — who regularly try to expose and shame alleged child predators they entice online — were waiting for him. Malcolm was tall and handsome. The oldest son of Jamaican immigrants, he wholly subscribed to the idea of the American dream. In high school, Malcolm was vice president of the Future Business Leaders of America club, assistant captain of the tennis and swim teams and a member of the student council and Model United Nations. He started a social marketing business at 15. After graduating in 2016, Malcolm filled his Instagram and Facebook feeds with photos of New York high-rises, bathroom selfies in three-piece suits and links to news articles in which he was featured. He went to community college while working as a junior buyer for a local circuit-board manufacturer and was the subject of a Connecticut Public Television series that profiled recent high school graduates. Earlier this year, he was named one of Litchfield County’s 40 Leaders Under 40. Malcolm was also gay, which was difficult growing up in a religious family in Torrington, a sleepy former mill town in the northwest part of the state, friends said. “It’s not easy to be black, Jamaican, a Jehovah’s Witness and gay in Torrington, Connecticut,” said Allie Morrissey, a friend of Malcolm’s. Starting in high school, Malcolm used apps like Tinder and Grindr to meet men from around the state, friends said. On that October night, he had come to Bristol to meet someone younger, purportedly a 14-year-old boy “going on 15,” according to a video posted by the digital vigilante group known as POPSquad. When Malcolm arrived, he found that there was no boy — there was only POPSquad. For the 126th time in two years, the group — an acronym for Prey on Predators — had catfished a man on the internet, posing as an underage teen on hookup apps and luring him into a meetup, this time at an empty home whose owner allows it to be used for the group’s stings, according to POPSquad. Like the others before him, Malcolm was greeted by Shane Erdmann, 31, better known by his alias “Incognito,” who questioned and berated Malcolm as the camera rolled. (The entire encounter was posted on Facebook the next day, though it was later removed. NBC News spoke to three people who watched it — two friends of Malcolm’s and one POPSquad fan — and described its contents.) Confronting Malcolm with copies of the alleged sexual online messages sent to a POPSquad member, Erdmann asked: Why had Malcolm come? What disgusting things was he planning to do? What would his family think? “I don’t have anything to live for,” Malcolm said as he stared at the ground. Although his targets may initially believe otherwise, Erdmann isn’t with the police, and Malcolm wasn’t required to talk with POPSquad. As Malcolm walked to his car, Erdmann followed to film his license plate, reading the numbers aloud, “for the camera,” Erdmann said. “Your family is going to see this. How do you feel?” Erdmann asked, according to people who saw the video. Malcolm honked twice as he sped away, driving 30 minutes back home to his parents’ house in Torrington, where he hanged himself. POPSquad is one of dozens of similar online groups across the country unified by what they say is a mission to expose and shame people they allege are or could become sexual predators, according to an NBC News review of these groups on Facebook. The idea isn’t new — the NBC News “Dateline” show mined the same territory in its special series, “To Catch a Predator,” from 2004 to 2007. Ratings soared, and the network described it as a public service, but in three years the series was over, after drawing negative news coverage, advertiser wariness and a lawsuit from the family of a target who killed himself, which was later settled, with both parties saying only that it had “been amicably resolved."" There have been several copycats of “To Catch a Predator,” including Ontario construction worker Justin Payne, who ensnared dozens of men by 2015. In British Columbia, Ryan LaForge made a name (and a criminal record, pleading guilty to two counts of assault) with his group, Creep Catchers, and in Michigan, Zach Sweers caught potential predators under the name “Anxiety War” until 2016, when he settled two civil lawsuits from targets. Now, thanks in part to social media, these groups have multiplied rapidly in recent months, propelled by a rabid and growing fanbase, according to law enforcement officials and Facebook data. The NBC News review found more than 30 similar operations on Facebook across 23 states. Most have formed in the last year, finding an audience and influence on Facebook, where hundreds of thousands of users like and follow them, watch videos of their stings and support their efforts with donations and the purchase of branded merchandise. Truckers Against Predators, started in June by a St. Louis truck driver, Anthony Greene, has quickly become the genre’s most popular group, with 92,000 Facebook followers, according to NBC News’ review of the groups. Greene, who uses a team of decoys to fish for potential predators to berate in gas station parking lots, said he was inspired by Shane Coyle, who runs Facebook’s second-most-popular predator hunter group, Prank Call Mafia. Coyle, a former MTV reality show contestant with a criminal record unrelated to the group, disguises his voice like a minor to lure men to Florida meetups. Sometimes, though not often, a sting by these groups ends in an arrest of the potential predator by local police. In the two years since Erdmann founded POPSquad, the group has recorded over 131 stings and claims to have been involved in 14 arrests, all of which NBC News has confirmed, though not all of the men were charged with crimes related to POPSquad’s videos. Nonetheless, many law enforcement officers object to the groups and consider them dangerous vigilantes. Even when police don’t get involved, the predator hunters and their loyal followers are ready to exact their own form of justice on social media, making sure that the alleged predator’s video is seen by his family, friends and employers. Frank Norris, 32, a POPSquad follower from Cheshire, Connecticut, is one self-appointed enforcer. “I’ve called state police, I’ve called family members and I say, ‘This is your family member,’ so they can distance themselves,” Norris said of the men caught on POPSquad’s videos. “I think it’s disgusting. I think it’s a huge problem. That's why I’m active. You want to shame these people.” These online hunters are tapping into a hunger for vengeance, said Steven Kohm, a cultural criminologist at the University of Winnipeg. “Criminal justice used to be emotional and participatory,” Kohm said. “Over the last 100 years, it’s become mostly hidden and dominated by professionals. People are yearning to reconnect with the punitive emotional core of the justice system. These groups focusing on the pedophile, a universally reviled category, helps them connect with the lost aspect of the justice system.” Kohm linked the hunters to the popularity of internet sleuthing, at a time of deep mistrust in authority. It appears to be the same impulse that fueled Qanon, ""pizzagate"" and other popular conspiracy theories obsessively “investigated” by online groups. “It’s a mob-justice vigilante mentality,” Kohm said. This site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service Facebook is a key piece of the groups’ strategy. “These kind of stories, visceral and violent, are more likely to be shared on Facebook,” said Mitali Thakor, an assistant professor at Wesleyan University and expert on digital vigilantism and online child exploitation. Facebook’s focus on local stories and groups could also amplify the predator hunters’ content, Thakor said. “You’re more likely to see these kind of local stories because Facebook suggests content based on location, and because it’s hyper-localized it seems real and relevant, like this content is from your community newspaper.” Facebook told NBC News that it is aware of these groups and does not ban them outright, although much of what they do appears to violate Facebook’s rules against shaming or cyberbullying. “We want people to use Facebook and our products to raise awareness about threats to public safety, including those who may pose harm to children,” a company spokesperson said in a statement to NBC News. “However, we do not want people to use Facebook to facilitate vigilante violence. That’s why we have policies against threatening real-world harm and to protect people’s privacy if they are being publicly shamed. We will remove content that violates these policies when it is reported.” Facebook does not allow posts that “reveal personally identifiable information"" or amount to cyberbullying, the spokesperson said. The company reviews posts when they are flagged. After an inquiry from NBC News, Facebook temporarily suspended several predator hunter accounts, removed some individual posts and deleted at least one group entirely. Some groups voluntarily removed their own pages to escape what they saw as a purge. POPSquad appeared to be unaffected. ""There's nothing anybody can do to stop us.” Anthony Greene of Truckers Against Predators was among the users disciplined by Facebook. In a Facebook Live video, Greene told his followers he was locked out of his account, in ""Facebook jail"" for the next 30 days. ""Things will be all right,” Greene said. “We're 90,000 strong, guys. There's nothing anybody can do to stop us.” On Oct. 20, a day after filming Malcolm’s panicked response to the sting, POPSquad labeled him No. 126 and posted the video on Facebook, to 17,000 followers. It didn’t take long for the POPSquad video to reach Torrington. At the same time, news of Malcolm’s death the previous evening was making its way through town and into the comments on POPSquad’s Facebook page. Even after locals commented that Malcolm had died and linked to his obituary, many POPSquad fans responded with glee. “The comments were awful,” said Morrissey, 20, a high school friend of Malcolm’s who saw the video online. “Terrible things like: ‘We’re so happy he killed himself. Thank you God for taking another disgusting person off the Earth.’” “It wasn’t even people our age,” added Marielle Franco, 20, another friend. “It was like people my mom’s age.” POPSquad took down the video after less than 24 hours and replaced it with a post in which the group vowed to continue its work “without hesitation.” “It will be natural to feel sad if something happens to a predator, but remember. He is not the innocent,” the post said. “He is not a victim. He tried to create a victim. This catch was no different than all the others before it and his actions are his and his alone.” Erdmann declined to comment on the video of Malcolm and responded to NBC News’ follow-up questions with a threat to sue. Malcolm’s family did not respond to requests for comment. There is an open investigation into Malcolm’s death, according to Torrington Police Department Lt. Bart Barone. “We’re still trying to get in touch with POPSquad and see what the whole thing was about,” Barone said. “It really was a sad situation. He was a young kid.” Erdmann, who is thin and covered in tattoos, runs POPSquad from an abandoned factory in Bristol, Connecticut. He and four volunteer team members work in an office lit by black lights and security monitors to catfish potential predators, edit videos and maintain the POPSquad website. A former self-described “hustler,” and staple of the early-aughts Connecticut rap scene, Erdmann later hyped WakeUpNow, a Utah-based multilevel marketing company that targeted the hip-hop community. He is currently on probation for an unrelated 2016 felony drug conviction and now makes money from selling original music along with POPSquad hats and sweatshirts, and soliciting donations from his followers. “I've been an entrepreneur for a long time,” Erdmann said. ""I’m using the same entrepreneur skill sets that I was when I got into trouble, but not the same products. I create the product now."" While Erdmann wouldn’t talk about Malcolm on the record, he was eager to rattle off the names of POPSquad targets and their number on his list. “In this field, sex crimes, no one can hold a candle to me."" Among his highest profile catches that ended in related arrests and guilty pleas: Scott Backer, No. 5, a former associate dean of students at Wesleyan who pleaded guilty to enticing a minor and was sentenced to probation after Erdmann confronted him in a Walmart girls section; James Batt, No. 33, a high school special education teacher whom Erdmann filmed at a Dunkin’ Donuts and who pleaded guilty to child pornography possession; Cole Sutton, No. 46, a school photographer who pleaded guilty to risk of injury to a minor and is serving a five-year suspended sentence; and Keith Dubin, No. 60, who pleaded guilty to risk of injury to a minor and possession of child pornography and is serving an 18-month sentence. But POPSquad's very involvement may hinder prosecution. ""It was one of the reasons why they gave my client some leniency,” Backer’s attorney, Anthony Spinella, said of the state's attorney in Hartford who prosecuted the case, who declined to comment. “Putting these vigilantes on the stand would have been be a nightmare.” Lawyers for the other men did not respond to requests for comment. These operations have been the subject of dozens of local news stories that praise POPSquad’s work. Although Erdmann’s identity is known to the police, he operates under his “Incognito” alias and refuses to be photographed without a mask. Local television and print reporters cover his exploits without revealing his identity. In Bristol, where most of POPSquad’s stings are conducted, the police and local government walk a fine line, using POPSquad’s work without officially supporting his tactics. “As a community, we understand that parents and families are hypersensitive to predatory behaviors and keeping their kids safe,” Bristol Mayor Ellen Zoppo-Sassu said in a statement. “Our Police Department has an active Criminal Investigation Unit that has many active cases of their own, and also have received leads from POPSquad which we pursue as well."" Erdmann said he feels Bristol police don’t appreciate his talent or his results. “Nobody out here does it. And the ones who are doing it, aren’t doing it right. Even the cops,” Erdmann said. “In this field, sex crimes, no one can hold a candle to me. And that’s a problem.” Referring to Erdmann, Bristol Police Lt. Richard Guerrera told NBC News: “We don’t have a working relationship with him. We don’t advise him, he doesn’t call us, he does his thing and if a report is made, we investigate it.” Things don’t always go smoothly. In August 2017, a man who allegedly came to a Planet Fitness parking lot at midnight to meet a 14-year-old girl found Erdmann instead. When the target, Jordan Malmstrom, 33, realized Erdmann was filming, he attacked, according to a police report of the incident. Police wrote that Malmstrom punched Erdmann repeatedly and stole his camera. As Malmstrom sped away, his car clipped Erdmann’s leg. Malmstrom was arrested in February and charged with assault, larceny and enticing a minor. He pleaded not guilty. At a December hearing, a prosecutor told the judge the state was no longer willing to pursue the case, and the charges were dropped. Malmstrom’s lawyer, David Kamins, told NBC News that the state noted in remarks to the judge that Erdmann had been uncooperative. The state's attorney declined to comment on the case. Beyond Bristol, groups like POPSquad have met resistance from law enforcement agencies concerned that untrained civilians — many with criminal records of their own, like Erdmann — are confronting targets in stings that may threaten public safety and have unintended consequences. ""It’s detrimental to what we're trying to do,” said David Frattare, Ohio’s director of state investigations for the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force, a national group of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies that investigate online child sexual exploitation. “We spend an inordinate amount of effort to train officers to conduct these investigations in a secure and safe way that will maintain the evidence and end in prosecution."" In the past six months, Frattare said he has seen a ""resurgence"" in online child-predator hunting groups not seen since the early 2000s. These online vigilantes, who often show up in police-style gear and use language that gives the false impression that they are members of law enforcement, have been a topic of conversation at meetings with the other 60 commanders who lead the national program. ""They're seeing these groups spring up in their areas,” said Frattare, who advises local law enforcement to discourage the vigilantes. “We've tried to let them know some of the dangers they're facing by going out and putting themselves in harm’s way. They aren't trained."" ""Sooner or later there's going to be someone who gets hurt,"" Frattare added. Erdmann says he’s not concerned about his own safety, or the safety of the people he targets. This month, his probation on the drug conviction ends and he says he’ll likely leave Connecticut for bigger things: international stings, seminars across the country, and if all goes well, a POPSquad television show. He signed a contract earlier this year with a reality show development agency, Smartmonkey Productions, but no one’s bitten yet. For now, his audience is online. “It’s a cult following,” Erdmann said. “There’s two types of people who don’t like POPSquad: We either caught you or you know somebody that we caught.” Brandy Zadrozny is an investigative reporter for NBC News."
OVAC;1;1;"A Pennsylvania police chief arrested in a child sex sting operation identified himself as a “kutecop4you” in an online ad and allegedly said “everyone has to have a first time” when the phony school girl he was corresponding with told him she was only 14. “You will just have to get me naked tomorrow,” the chief, Michael William Diebold, who runs the three-man Leechburg Police Department, wrote, according to a criminal complaint obtained Monday by NBC News. “I’m not teasing.” But the teenager was really a special agent for the state Attorney General’s office named Daniel Block. Now Diebold, who became a local celebrity and the object of great sympathy last year after losing his lower left arm in a fireworks accident, is charged with unlawful contact with a minor and other offenses and was being held on $500,000 bond at the Westmoreland County Prison in Greensburg, Pennsylvania. “This case is particularly heinous because the perpetrator is a public official, sworn to serve and protect the community,” Attorney General Josh Shapiro said. “We have a zero tolerance policy for the sexual abuse of children and my office will prosecute any offender to the fullest extent of the law, no matter who they are.” This site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service Investigators zeroed-in on Diebold on Sept. 15 after he allegedly posted an ad spelling out in no uncertain terms what kind of sex he was looking for — and clearly identified himself as a cop. “I am a dom male that is also employed as a full time police officer,” the ad read. “I hope that doesn’t scare you off.” Diebold, 40, described himself in the ad as “white, straight, good looking, clean,” said he was disease free as well as “mentally stable and fun.” “I am looking for a female sub for ongoing play sessions,” the ad read. “I respect any and all limits and you do not need to be experienced.” Diebold was allegedly not deterred when Block, pretending to be an eighth-grade girl, told him repeatedly he was 14. “Need a warm up, how much room is in that cozy bed,” he allegedly wrote. Then on Dec. 29, Diebold allegedly sent Block an image of what appeared to be a picture of his erect penis hidden by jeans. Police were waiting when Diebold went to meet the fictional girl. Wayne Dobos, the mayor of Leechburg, a borough of about 2,000 people some 35 miles northeast of Pittsburgh, said that Diebold ""has been suspended without pay."" But he remains the chief of the police on the municipal web site. Just last summer, Diebold found himself on the receiving end of nationwide sympathy — and was interviewed by ABC's ""Good Morning America"" — after he was maimed on June 24 in a fireworks accident at the Leechburg Volunteer Fire Company’s annual carnival. Despite the injury, Diebold and fiancée Danielle Reinke tied the knot 18 days later. ""I've heard from police officers across the nation, across the world,"" Diebold said while leaving the hospital.

PVAC;1;1;"BELLEFONTE, Pa. — A son of former Penn State University assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky pleaded guilty Friday to charges he pressured a teenage girl to send him naked photos and asked her teen sister to give him oral sex. Jeffrey Sandusky's plea deal comes a week before his trial was slated to begin on the charges, and nearly six years after his father was arrested in a child molestation case that shook Penn State and is still working its way through criminal and civil courts. Jeffrey Sandusky pleaded guilty to all 14 counts, including solicitation of statutory sexual assault and solicitation of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse. A call seeking comment from his lawyer wasn't immediately returned Friday. As part of the deal, 41-year-old Sandusky will spend up to six years in state prison, but the judge could impose as much as eight years. This site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service Centre County District Attorney Stacy Parks Miller said the plea deal ensures the victims don't suffer additional trauma by testifying at the trial. ""We are happy that these girls can move forward and experience a life with adults that deserve their trust,"" she said. One of six adopted children of Jerry Sandusky, Jeffrey Sandusky has been a stalwart supporter of his father, who is serving a lengthy prison sentence for sexual abuse of 10 boys. He regularly attended his father's court proceedings alongside his mother, Dottie Sandusky, who also has consistently supported her husband and fought to clear his name. Jeffrey Sandusky, a state prison guard, knew the girls through their mother, authorities said. A state trooper said in the arrest affidavit that last November, their father turned over to investigators text messages from Sandusky in which he asked one of the girls for nude photographs. The affidavit said Sandusky told the teen in texts from March 2016 that ""it's not weird because he studied medicine"" and instructed her ""to not show these texts to anyone."" The girl's mother told investigators that when she confronted Sandusky, he told her ""he knows it was wrong and inappropriate,"" police said. The girl told police the texts made her uncomfortable and that ""he kept pressuring me and asked me multiple times not to show the texts to anyone,"" police said. Prosecutors allege Jeffrey Sandusky sought oral sex from the other girl in 2013. She was 15 years old at the time. That teen told investigators that Jeffrey Sandusky told her later: ""I can't even say anything except I'm sorry."""
OVAC;0;1;"A Michigan doctor accused of sexually abusing dozens of patients, including an Olympic medalist, was ordered held without bond Wednesday after an FBI agent detailed some of the evidence against him, including footage that allegedly shows him abusing girls. Dr. Larry Nassar, who was a doctor for USA Gymnastics for almost 20 years, was arrested last week on federal child pornography charges. He had previously been charged with sexually abusing a young girl at his home and is named in more than 60 police complaints and three lawsuits. At a detention hearing, FBI agent Rod Charles provided new details of the child porn case, according to NBC affiliate WOOD-TV: Nassar pleaded not guilty to the charges. He has also pleaded not guilty to state charges that he sexually abused a child over the course of six years. Related: Doc Accused of Gymnast Abuse Defends Procedures Charles described that victim as a family friend and said Nassar would lure her into games of hide-and-seek and then expose himself to her. The agent also detailed the accusations of three others who say Nassar abused them when they were under the age of 15. More than 60 women have filed complaints with police alleging they were abused under the guise of invasive medical exams. And on Wednesday, a woman named Tiffany Thomas Lopez filed a lawsuit against Nassar and Michigan State University, where he had his practice until he was fired in September. Lopez, 36, said Nassar began treating her when she was a freshman softball player at Michigan State in 1998. She alleges that he molested her at least 10 times and that university staffers ignored her complaints. During treatment sessions, Nassar inserted his finger into her vagina — sometimes gloved and sometimes not — and pressed on a pelvic bone, Lopez said. Sometimes a female trainer was in the room. ""I felt uncomfortable because I didn’t think that was necessary,"" she said. She said she expressed her concerns about Nassar's treatment to two trainers. When one of them heard the specifics, she ""gasped and said, 'What?'...and she turned bright red and told me that was completely inappropriate and I needed to say something,"" Lopez said. This site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service ""I remember us crying together,"" Lopez said. But when Lopez met with a supervisor in March 2000, she said, the reaction was far different. ""She says, 'He’s a world-renowned doctor. He treats elite athletes, athletes just like yourself,'"" Lopez said. ""It was basically — you need to be grateful you are getting this treatment. She made me feel like I was crazy."" Lopez said she began refusing treatment, stopped playing softball and eventually left Michigan State and returned home to California. ""I felt like I wanted to disappear,"" she said. Michigan State has said the first time it received a complaint about Nassar was in 2014. It investigated the incident, and prosecutors declined to bring charges, the school says. Nassar's personnel file, obtained by NBC News through a freedom of information request, shows that the school put restrictions on the doctor after an internal sexual harassment investigation in response to the 2014 complaint. ""We will have another person in the room whenever we are approaching a patient to perform procedures of anything close to a sensitive nature,"" William Strampel, the dean of the College of Osteopathic Medicine, wrote in a July 2014 email to Nassar spelling out the measures they had agreed upon. ""The procedure which caused the patient emotional distress because of her interpretation will be modified in the future to be sure there is little to no skin to skin contact when in these regions,"" Strampel added. ""Should this be absolutely necessary, the procedure will be explained in detail with another person in the room for both the explanation and the procedure."" Strampel ended the email by saying, ""I am happy this has resolved to some extend (sic) and I am happy to have you back in full practice."" Jason Cody, a spokesman for Michigan State, said the investigation into Nassar found no violation of policy. ""There was no reason based on those investigations to remove Nassar from the staff,"" he said. ""However, based on the investigation, we did feel it was prudent to reinforce with Nassar the proper protocols for certain medical procedures."" Nassar continued to treat patients until the allegations against him first became public in an Indianapolis Star investigation in September. He remained at Michigan State even after he was fired by USA Gymnastics in the summer of 2015 amid ""athlete concerns"" that prompted the organization, which governs the sport and selects the Olympic teams, to report him to the FBI. The school says USA Gymnastics never told them of those concerns. After the scandal exploded, and dozens of former patients began filing complaints against Nassar, Michigan State terminated him, citing violations of the 2014 agreement by performing the procedure without gloves and alone with two patients. ""This is a serious breach and is not acceptable,"" the university said in an email to Nassar, also noting he had failed to disclose a 2004 police complaint against him about alleged sex abuse. Nassar responded two days later with an email that said he was heartbroken and vowed he would ""overcome this."" ""I am so sorry this situation has become so public in the media casting such a shadow over myself and MSU,"" Nassar wrote. ""I understand your position and appreciate all the support you have given me."" Two months passed before Lopez heard about the charges against Nassar and decided to come forward. ""It's hard to relive the trauma,"" she told NBC News. ""But it feels good in a sense to know I'm validated. I'm not crazy. What happened was definitely real. ""But I feel disappointed in Michigan State. I really bled green for them and they let me down and they let a lot of other girls down."" She said that she thinks constantly about the women who say they were abused by Nassar after she left Michigan State and struggles with feelings of guilt. ""I think about how if I would have stayed on them and made them believe me, no one would have to suffer,"" she said, crying. Lopez's lawyer, John Manly, is representing two other women — one of them an Olympic medalist — in other ""Jane Doe"" lawsuits against Nassar, Michigan State and USA Gymnastics. He has filed paperwork announcing his intention to file 15 more suits. ""The more it goes on, the more it starts to feel like a Sandusky situation,"" he said, referring to the sex abuse scandal at Penn State University. University officials said they had not seen Lopez's suit and could not comment on it ""I can tell you we take allegations of sexual abuse very seriously,"" Cody said. ""Our police, the lead investigative agency in the Nassar case, are devoting significant resources to the criminal investigation against him and are vigorously reviewing all complaints and working through them with the state Attorney General’s office and federal U.S. Attorney’s Office.""

Kristof — a friend of the Farrow family — explained in an editor's note that Farrow was writing publicly for the first time about her allegations. Farrow, now 28, detailed instances of inappropriate touching and one-on-one encounters with Allen, which she said she dreaded and did anything she could to avoid. ""These things happened so often, so routinely, so skillfully hidden from a mother that would have protected me had she known, that I thought it was normal,"" Farrow wrote.

Known for staying out of the public eye, Allen vehemently denied the claims at the time in in a news conference. ""This is an unconscionable and gruesomely damaging manipulation of innocent children for vindictive and self-serving motives,"" he said, according to the Times.

""The one to blame for Dylan's distress is neither Dylan nor Woody Allen."" The renewed accusations resurfaced as Allen's latest project, the movie Blue Jasmine, is nominated for three Academy Awards, including best original screenplay for the director. In her letter, Farrow also called out Blue Jasmine actors Alec Baldwin, Cate Blanchett, and Louis C.K., asking, ""What if it had been your child""? Allen was also recently honored with a lifetime achievement award at the Golden Globes, which actress Diane Keaton accepted on his behalf on Jan. 12.

OVAC;0;1;"HELENA, Mont. — The Jehovah's Witnesses must pay $35 million to a woman who says the church's national organization ordered Montana clergy members not to report her sexual abuse as a child at the hands of a congregation member, a jury ruled in a verdict. A judge must review the penalty, and the Jehovah's Witnesses' national organization — Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York — plans to appeal. Still, the 21-year-old woman's attorneys said Wednesday's verdict sends a message to the church to report child abuse to outside authorities. ""Hopefully that message is loud enough that this will cause the organization to change its priorities in a way that they will begin prioritizing the safety of children so that other children aren't abused in the future,"" said attorney Neil Smith Thursday. The Office of Public Information at the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses responded to the verdict with an unsigned statement. ""Jehovah's Witnesses abhor child abuse and strive to protect children from such acts. Watchtower is pursuing appellate review,"" it said. This site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service The Montana case is one of dozens that have been filed nationwide over the past decade alleging Jehovah's Witnesses mismanaged or covered up the sexual abuse of children. The case that prompted Wednesday's ruling involved two women, now 32 and 21, who allege a family member sexually abused them and a third family member in Thompson Falls in the 1990s and 2000s. The women say they reported the abuse to church elders, who handled the matter internally after consulting with the national organization. The elders expelled the abuser from the congregation in 2004 then reinstated him the next year, the lawsuit states, and the abuse of the girl who is now 21 continued. The lawsuit claimed the local and national Jehovah's Witnesses organizations were negligent and violated a Montana law that requires them to report abuse to outside authorities. ""Their national headquarters, called Watchtower, they control when and if anyone within their organization reports child abuse,"" Smith said. ""Watchtower instructed everyone involved that they were not to report the matter to authorities."" Attorneys for the Jehovah's Witnesses said in court filings that Montana law exempts elders from reporting ""internal ecclesiastical proceedings on a congregation member's serious sin."" The church also contended that the national organization isn't liable for the actions by Thompson Falls elders, and that too much time has passed for the women to sue. The jury awarded the 21-year-old woman $4 million for her injuries, plus $30 million in punitive damages against Watchtower and $1 million in punitive damages against the Christian Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses, another Jehovah's Witness corporation that communicates with congregations across the U.S. The monetary award must be reviewed by the trial judge and could be reduced. A Montana law caps punitive damage awards at 3 percent of a company's net worth or $10 million, whichever is less. A legal challenge to that law is pending before the Montana Supreme Court. The jury dismissed claims that the church should have reported the second woman's abuse by the same congregation member. Jurors concluded church elders did not receive notice of the 32-year-old woman's abuse in 1998 as she said they did, and therefore did not have a duty to tell authorities. The third family member who claimed abuse was not a plaintiff in the lawsuit. The Associated Press generally does not name people who say they are a victim of a sex crime."

OVAC;0;1;"Former Palm Beach police chief Michael Reiter spent years trying to convince state and federal prosecutors in Florida to bring serious charges against Jeffrey Epstein. Now, the retired lawman wants to tackle a new mission: to persuade lawmakers to take action to prevent the next Jeffrey Epstein from perverting the criminal justice system. “Epstein found every loophole,” Reiter told NBC News as part of a months-long ""Dateline"" investigation. ""I want some system in the future that this can't happen again."" Reiter said he believes the state and federal prosecutors’ handling of the Epstein case amounts to “the worst failure of the criminal justice system"" in modern times. The story begins in March 2005 when the Palm Beach police department received a call from the distraught mother of a 14-year-old girl. The woman, Reiter recalled, said her underage daughter was having sex with an adult who lives in a mansion in Palm Beach. Palm Beach police detectives immediately launched an investigation. “They said, ‘This is credible. This is believable,” said Reiter, speaking in his first in-depth TV interview. “Our sense just from sitting in the room with the first victim was that this is something we’ve absolutely got to get on.” The interview with the initial young girl led to another and another. “I have no problem telling you everything that I know,” one of the girls told police in a videotaped interview obtained by NBC News. Another told police that Epstein “pulled out this vibrator thing and he pulled down my panties.” The investigators were immediately struck by the consistency of the accounts, Reiter said. “The stories were all the same,” he said. “They all could describe the house in detail. They could describe what happened.” In many cases, the victims' very specific physical descriptions of Epstein's body matched. But the detectives also observed that the accounts weren’t perfectly aligned; that would have been a red flag that the stories were coordinated, Reiter said. The investigators also noted something else of significance: many of the victims didn’t know each other, so there was little chance that they would have come together to concoct false allegations. Within those first few weeks, the investigation was already bearing fruit. “We realized that this was basically a way of life for Epstein,” Reiter said. “And it didn’t take too long to realize that a lot of people were involved in this...This was a very prolific sexual predator.” Detectives picked through Epstein’s trash and discovered incriminating messages on scraps of paper documenting phone calls. “She is wondering if 2:30 is OK...She needs to stay in school,” read one. The notes, it was clear to police, were about “massages and sex,” Reiter said. “And it isn’t just the phone messages,” Reiter said. “Epstein had flowers delivered to one of the victims who was in a performance at her high school, congratulating her at the end of the performance.” NBC News has spoken with nearly two dozen women who allege that Epstein didn’t operate alone. Reiter said the investigation identified adult women who had sexual contact with underage girls, and in some cases performed sexual battery on children. “This was a financially successful, smart, capable, well-networked and well-financed individual who built an organization around him that supported his criminal enterprise,” Reiter said. But as the months wore on with the police building their case, odd things began to happen. This site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service When detectives armed with a search warrant entered his home with a video camera, what they found made them suspect he had been tipped off. “The place had been cleaned up,” Reiter said. It wasn’t completely devoid of evidence but a computer that contained all of the home’s surveillance camera footage was gone. “And all the wires were left hanging there,” Reiter said. After six months of investigation, Reiter said, the local police department noticed a shift in attitude from the state prosecutors. Reiter said the prosecutors told him the witnesses were not credible. The prosecutors, Reiter said, suddenly seemed dismissive of the case, and were uncooperative in approving critical investigative techniques that hindered the Palm Beach police department investigation. Epstein, who had a massive bankroll and extensive connections, had assembled a high-powered team of lawyers, including Kenneth Starr, Alan Dershowitz, Jack Goldberger and Jay Lefkowitz. Around this time, Reiter said, the investigation took another strange turn; Epstein’s defense team seemed to know details about the probe before they were made public. “We believed that the content of our probable cause affidavit eventually, some time after we presented it to the state attorney's office, ended up with the defense attorneys,” Reiter said. “Because minute details that nobody else knew that were in those documents were being refuted and contrary information provided by the defense.” “This,” Reiter said, “never happened to me before in my career.” Reiter was so frustrated that he took the unusual step of asking the state attorney, Barry Krischer, to remove himself from the case, citing the office’s “highly unusual” treatment of the investigation. When that didn’t work, the police chief turned his evidence over to the FBI. “And they said, ‘This is an easy case. This is a horrific situation. We’ll put him away for the rest of his life,’” Reiter recalled. “That’s what the U.S. attorney, assistant U.S. attorneys, told us as well.” But Reiter’s renewed enthusiasm didn’t last long. In time it became clear that the federal probe was also stalling, though he believes the FBI agents were invested in the case. Reiter arranged to meet face-to-face with the prosecutor in charge of the case, U.S. Attorney Alex Acosta. Acosta would go on to be named U.S. labor secretary under President Donald Trump. The conversation, Reiter said, did not get off to a promising start. “He basically said in a very measured manner that the defense in this case has successfully delayed and frustrated their investigation and their prosecution of the case,” Reiter said. But Reiter left Acosta’s office hoping for the best after the prosecutor told him they were moving forward with the investigation. “I left that meeting thinking, ‘This guy hopefully is going to do his job,’” Reiter said. It didn’t turn out the way Reiter had hoped. In 2007, Acosta made the decision not to charge Epstein in federal court. Instead, he sent the case back to the local prosecutors. Reiter was crushed. The same office that had seemingly refused to pursue Epstein aggressively was now back in charge. Acosta agreed to sign a non-prosecution deal that ended the federal sex crimes investigation and spared Epstein the prospect of serving several years in prison. Instead, Epstein pleaded guilty to state charges of soliciting a minor for prostitution and served 13 months at Palm Beach county jail. Epstein was also required to register as a sex offender and pay his restitution to his victims. “I’ve never seen anything like it,” Reiter said. “It was extremely unusual and disappointing.” Reiter said he believes the result would have been different had the victims been underage boys. ""That would have shocked the senses more,"" Reiter said. ""Somehow this hit a different place — that they were young women on the way to being women."" Epstein was released from jail in the summer of 2009. The case seemed behind him until 2018 when the Miami Herald published an expose highlighting the government’s kid-glove treatment of a man accused of preying on dozens of underage girls. Acosta defended the way his office handled what he described as a complicated case. “We believe we proceeded appropriately,” Acosta said during a July 2019 press conference. ""We did what we did because we wanted to see Epstein go to jail."" But Acosta resigned as labor secretary two days later amid mounting criticism. Krischer, the former state attorney, didn’t return a request for comment from NBC News. But he released a statement in July defending his office and pushing back against Acosta's suggestion that state prosecutors were driving the case. ""If Mr. Acosta was truly concerned with the state’s case and felt he had to rescue the matter, he would have moved forward with the 53-page indictment that his own office drafted,"" Krischer said. Epstein was arrested on fresh charges in July. New York federal prosecutors charged him with sex trafficking and conspiracy in a case that featured similar allegations to those a decade earlier. Epstein pleaded not guilty but he committed suicide inside his federal jail cell last month. The death left Reiter thinking about the victims, and their lost chance to see him held accountable. “I feel badly for the victims,” Reiter said. “I realize that there’s a catharsis in confronting Epstein and they’ll never have that opportunity.” But he hopes that the entirety of the case will lead to systemic change. “The criminal justice system needs to learn from this and make sure it can’t happen again,” said Reiter, who still lives in Palm Beach where he runs a security consulting firm. Reiter wants to see legislation that bars minors from being labeled as prostitutes in the justice system. He also called on Florida lawmakers to close the loopholes that allow people like Epstein to get away with misdemeanors for child sex crimes. “If you look at the first dozen victims and their accounts of what happened to them, it’s clear to me he was coached by a lawyer on how to only commit a misdemeanor,” Reiter said. “If you're a member of the legislature and you're out listening to this right now, fix this. It needs to be fixed.” Reiter also delivered a message to all of those girls whose lives were upended by a middle-aged sexual predator with endless resources available to him. “I don't have any contact with the victims, and if they're listening now, I'm embarrassed for the way the criminal justice system treated them back then in Florida, Reiter said. “But I want them to know that not every part of the system failed them. We did our job in the Palm Beach Police Department. And everything that happens here should lead to, in the future, if any of these things happen again to some other victim, that the system won't fail them.” Sarah Fitzpatrick is an investigative producer for NBC News.

OVAC;0;1;Jeffrey Epstein's estate is likely to be hit with a barrage of lawsuits when a new law in New York state aimed to help child sex abuse victims goes into effect Wednesday. The Child Victims Act gives people a one-year window to sue for sex abuse damages, regardless of when the alleged acts happened. In addition to that, the law also extends the statute of limitations for criminal charges against child sex abusers. “While Epstein is dead, the cases against him will live on,” New York state Sen. Brady Hoylman told NBC News on Monday, two days after the wealthy financier and accused sex trafficker was found dead in his jail cell of an apparent suicide. “Hopefully, they will reveal why his crimes were hidden for so long and who enabled him to hide from the law.” Hoylman and Assemblywoman Linda Rosenthal, both Manhattan Democrats, were the prime movers behind the new law that was primarily intended to help sex abuse victims sue the Roman Catholic Church and other organizations for monetary damages. “I think the Epstein case is emblematic of the possibilities that survivors of child sex abuse will have beginning Aug. 14,” Hoylman said. “Abusers currently out of reach because of New York’s archaic statutes of limitations will now be subject to civil suits, as well as their estates.” Lisa Bloom, a Los Angeles-based lawyer who represents two women who say Epstein sexually abused them, said on social media the financier's death won’t deter them from suing. This site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service “We would have preferred he lived to face justice,” Bloom tweeted. “Our civil case can still proceed against his estate.” Predator Jeffrey Epstein killed himself. On behalf of the victims I represent, we would have preferred he lived to face justice.Our civil cases can still proceed against his estate. Victims deserve to be made whole for the lifelong damage he caused. We’re just getting started. New York lawyer Roberta Kaplan confirmed an earlier Reuters report that she intends to sue on behalf of a woman who was recruited in 2002 at age 14 to engage in sex acts with Epstein and was paid hundreds of dollars each time. And those are just two of the lawyers who will be suing Epstein, a moneyman who was friends with President Donald Trump, as well as former President Bill Clinton and other powerful people. His total assets were listed by his lawyers last month at about $559 million, including two private islands and four homes, a $77 million mansion on the Upper East Side of Manhattan among them. Epstein, 66, was found unresponsive Saturday in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center and federal authorities are investigating why he wasn’t being closely monitored. He was supposed to be checked on every 30 minutes, multiple officials have told NBC News. Awaiting trial for sex trafficking conspiracy and sex trafficking, Epstein faced up to 45 years in prison if found guilty. He was arrested July 6 and was denied bail after pleading not guilty to the charges. His death came the day after a raft of court documents was unsealed, providing new details about Epstein's alleged crimes. Epstein allegedly sought out minors from at least 2002 through 2005 and paid them hundreds of dollars in cash for sex at either his Manhattan residence or his estate in Palm Beach, Florida, federal prosecutors revealed last month. He pleaded not guilty and was denied bail. Epstein was already a registered sex offender in Florida after he pleaded guilty in 2008 to procuring a person under 18 for prostitution and felony solicitation of prostitution. His plea was part of a nonprosecution agreement Epstein signed with the office of the U.S. attorney for Miami which critics have derided as a slap on the wrist. The then-U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida was Alex Acosta, who was Trump's secretary of labor until he was forced to resign following criticism for how he handled the Epstein case. NBC News has reached out to Epstein's attorney for comment. Corky Siemaszko is a senior writer for NBC News Digital.
OVAC;1;1;"Former Subway pitchman Jared Fogle was sentenced to over 15 years behind bars Thursday for child porn and sex crime charges — after tearfully telling the judge he wants to become a ""good, honest person."" ""I want to redeem my life,"" said Fogle, his voice cracking with emotion as he wiped his eyes during his sentencing. A federal judge in Indianapolis sentenced Fogle to 188 months for one count of traveling to engage in sexual conduct with a minor and one count of receiving child pornography. He will serve his time concurrently, and won’t be eligible for parole before 13 years. His attorneys had asked for a lighter sentence of five years in prison, arguing that he’s already ""lost everything"" and will live with the consequences of his behavior for the rest of his life. Prosecutors sought 12-1/2 years. U.S. District Judge Tanya Walton Pratt ordered Fogle into custody immediately, and recommended he go to federal prison in Colorado with a sex offender treatment program. She told him his lucrative lifestyle as a Subway spokesman was a ""gift"" — but he squandered his opportunities. ""The level of perversion and lawlessness exhibited by Mr. Fogle is extreme,"" Pratt said. The diet guru's weight loss journey made him a national celebrity before the child porn scandal brought an end to his career. Experts had testified Thursday that he fantasized about young girls and had a sex drive that ramped up after he begun shedding the pounds. Fogle recounted how he tried to live an honorable life before he was caught up in ""deception, lies and complete self-centeredness."" This site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service Since his arrest in August, he said, he's ""learned so much about the underage minors with whom I've paid to have sex with.""

Under a plea deal, he must also register as a sex offender after his release and have his digital devices monitored. He must also pay a fine of $175,000. Pratt, in reviewing the case to the courtroom Thursday, said that the images involved children as young as 6 and that Fogle asked adult prostitutes to procure children for him in various states. Related: Ex-Subway Pitchman Jared Fogle's Victims Get at Least $1 Million Before the sentencing, prosecutors and defense teams sparred in court over whether Fogle could have controlled himself — and whether he can be rehabilitated.

That included a ""mild case"" of pedophilia in which he became attracted to female teenagers, Bradford said. He added that there was a low to moderate risk of Fogle relapsing. But the prosecution highlighted his texts and emails to convince the judge he deserved a harsher punishment. In one exchange, Fogle offered to pay $300 for a 15-year-old who could prove her age, prosecutors said: ""It's what I crave,"" he wrote.

OVAC;0;1;"Famed defense attorney Alan Dershowitz on Tuesday forcefully denied that he had sex with an underage girl provided to him by Jeffrey Epstein. Standing outside a New York City courthouse, Dershowitz pushed back against the claims by accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre. ""I've never met Virginia Giuffre. I've never had sex with her. And the reason I'm saying it is because it's true,"" Dershowitz said to a gathering of reporters after a hearing related to a defamation lawsuit filed against him. ""She, on the other hand, has never and will never stand in front of any media and repeat her lie that she did have sex with me."" A female bystander heckled Dershowitz at one point — shouting 'Liar! Liar!' We don't believe you!' — but he kept speaking. Dershowitz said Giuffre and her lawyer David Boies had done ""a terrible disservice to a great movement, the 'Me Too' movement."" ""The 'Me Too' movement relies on credible reports of sexual misconduct and when a woman and her lawyer make false allegations and falsely accuse people, it hurts not only the falsely accused person, me, but it hurts everybody who is a true victim of sexual abuse,"" Dershowitz said. This site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service Dershowitz spoke out after a hearing that marked the latest development in a legal battle stemming from the Epstein child sex abuse case. Giuffre sued Dershowitz in April alleging that she was lent out to him for sex while she was underage. The suit contends that Dershowitz defamed Giuffre by branding her a liar who concocted a false story with the help of money-hungry lawyers. Giuffre claims Epstein ordered her to have sex with Dershowitz in the years after she was recruited to join Epstein's sex-trafficking ring in 2000. Giuffre's account gained new attention last year after the Miami Herald published a series of articles detailing how Epstein managed to avoid serious charges and a long prison sentence when he was investigated for preying on children in Florida in the mid-2000s. In her lawsuit, Giuffre claims that Dershowitz made a series of ""false and malicious defamatory statements"" about her after the newspaper expose was published. ""I never met Roberts; I never had sex with her; she simply made up the entire story for money,"" Dershowitz said on Dec. 1, 2018, according to Giuffre's suit. Three days later, Dershowitz was quoted calling her a ""certified, complete, total liar."" ""I can prove conclusively that she made the whole thing up,"" Dershowitz said. During the Tuesday hearing, Dershowitz remained silent as his attorney, Howard Cooper, argued that the judge should throw out the case because the statute of limitations had run out since the high-profile lawyer first attacked Giuffre's credibility in 2015. Giuffre's lawyer, Sigrid McCawley, countered that each time Dershowitz made his statements about Giuffre the countdown on the statute of limitations started anew. Epstein, who was arrested on new sex trafficking charges in July, committed suicide in his federal jail cell last month while awaiting trial.

They wear uniforms, have ranks, and take their orders from a self-appointed “general” named Deborah “Lila” Green who claims to be an “Oracle of God.” And for the hundred or so members of the Aggressive Christian Missions Training Corps (ACMTC), former followers say, Green’s word is law. “Lila claims to be God’s prophet and people in the group don’t question her,” former member Maura Schmierer told NBC News. “To not believe Lila Green is equal to sin.” The secretive Christian sect found itself thrust into the national spotlight earlier this week when Green and three of her followers were arrested and charged with rape and abusing children, as well as failing to register the births of children on their compound in Fence Lake, New Mexico, a speck on the map some 100 miles west of Albuquerque. Four others were arrested with their nine children when, according to police, they tried to flee their headquarters. The ACMTC has been branded an active hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center for its virulent anti-Semitism and gay bashing, which is discussed on its web site. Arrest warrants obtained by NBC New allege that Green presided over a compound where the births were not reported to authorities and children, who held the rank of private, were trained to hide when the police came around.

She became Green’s personal slave and was reportedly “treated like a dog” and whipped bloody for the most minor of infractions with the equivalent of a cat-o-nine tails, the warrants state. That girl, who is named in the papers but is not being identified by NBC News, told investigators that she was sexually abused by Green and by her son-in-law Peter Green, also known under the name Mike Brandon, who raped her four times a week from the time she was seven, the warrants allege.

She was arrested on a child abuse charge in Truth or Consequences, New Mexico. She told police the child died after he ""began to leak puss from his forehead."" Miller admitted to investigators she did not report his death to the authorities. Yet another key member of the sect, Joshua Green, is charged with failing to properly register a birth, according to the warrnats. All were being held in the local lockup and it was not immediately clear if they had gotten lawyers. But on their website, the sect denied the charges. Related: Four Sect Members Arrested in New Mexico With Vans Full of Children “We don’t know who all the accusers are, but the accusations are just re-runs of old lies that have been investigated and shown to be malicious attacks against a legitimate ministry,” they said in a statement obtained by The Associated Press. Schmierer joined the sect some 30-years-ago when it was called the “Free Love Ministries” and based in Sacramento, California. She first described her ordeal in a National Geographic special report. In an interview with NBC News, Schmierer said she didn’t see any sexual abuse while she was part of the group for five years. “But I witnessed a lot of child abuse,” she said. “We were taught we had to be hard on the children to raise them up to be Christian soldiers. When my son was 6 months old, we were in one of the services they hold all the time and he made a cute noise that distracted everybody. I was instructed to take him into another room and beat him. I couldn't do it.” Schmeirer said Green's husband, ""General Jim"" Green, was the official co-leader of a sect that believed the world was hurtling towards a final battle between good an evil that only they would survive. But his wife called the shots, she said. “They kept everybody in line by keeping us hungry and tired,” she said. “We would get awakened in the middle of the night for prayer sessions. They would limit our access to our families on the outside. They would even require us to change our names, which is why Lila’s son-in-law goes by Peter Green and not his real name.” A former sect member named Johanna, who asked that her last name not be revealed, said she was a troubled teenager when she joined in 1984 and finally fled in 2003. “General Jim has a bit of heart compared to her,” she said, referring to Green. “At first it was her and him running everything. But by the time I left, it was just her. I was pregnant with the child of another cult member and I knew I would be punished if I stayed. I had to leave my two other kids behind to get away.” Asked why she didn't leave earlier, Johanna answered, ""I believed Lila when she said I would go to hell."" Julianna Gudino was identified in the court papers as one of the people interviewed by investigators. She said she was in the sect for 20 years. The authorities first got wind of what was allegedly happening on the compound when the girl from Uganda was brought to a local hospital in either 2007 or 2008 with a broken leg, according to Gudino. “She had rickets and her legs were really fragile,” said Gudino, who lived on the compound when the girl was there. The child was removed from Green’s custody by the state Children Youth & Families Department and placed into foster care, she added. What happened to the girl afterward was not immediately clear. “Due to New Mexico state law, we are unable to release any information regarding any prior investigations that the agency is involved in,” CYFD spokesman Henry Varela said. “We do currently have an active investigation into this matter and will continue to work closely with law enforcement within our legal means.” Rick Alan Ross, an expert on cults, said he is very familiar with this group and said it runs on the backs of the free labor done by the children. He said the grownups are sent out to sell baked goods, picture frames and other trinkets they manufacture and the money goes back to Green. “In my opinion, they fit the profile of a classic destructive cult,” he said. “It’s run by Deborah Green. She is the charismatic personality. Her husband is subordinate. Whatever comes out of Deborah’s mouth is the word of God. Everybody’s wrong except Deborah.” Corky Siemaszko is a senior writer for NBC News Digital."

OVAC;0;1;A Wisconsin child sexual-assault suspect who evaded authorities for three years before he was found living in a makeshift, solar-powered bunker carved into an embankment will appear in court Friday for a plea hearing. Attorneys for the suspect, Jeremiah Button, reached a plea deal, but details of it were not immediately available. The hearing is set for Friday afternoon at a Portage County court, according to WSAU, citing court records. Button, 44, was re-arrested in August after a hunter found him sleeping in a bunker in the township of Ringle west of Wausau, about 145 miles north of Madison. Button had disappeared in February 2016 just weeks before he was set to go on trial on child sexual-assault and child-pornography charges. The man who found Button, Thomas Nelson, said that he stumbled upon a log door carved into an embankment and when he pushed the unlatched door open and went inside he saw a man lying on a bed. Nelson said he left the bunker and called the police. Button surrendered to authorities after a 20-minute standoff. He was taken into custody after deputies checked his information and learned that he had a felony warrant. Marathon County Sheriff's Deputy Matt Kecker said Button told investigators that he had been building the bunker while his case was moving through the court.

OVAC;0;1;"Three words separate the thousands of Pennsylvanians who say they were molested as children by Roman Catholic priests from receiving justice and compensation for their suffering: statutes of limitations. They are the reason why just two of the 301 priests named last week in state Attorney General Josh Shapiro’s bombshell report on sex abuse of children by priests in six Pennsylvania dioceses have been charged with crimes. That is also why most of the victims are unlikely, at this point, to get a dime in recompense. And while the findings in Shapiro’s report were greeted with universal revulsion and profuse apologies from the Catholic Church, expert say there’s no guarantee that anything is going to change for the aging victims of unspeakable acts that were inflicted on them when they were kids. Currently, the statute of limitations law in Pennsylvania allows victims of child sex abuse to come forward with criminal allegations until they are 50 years old. The age cutoff for filing civil claims is 30. Consider the political battle brewing in Harrisburg: In the wake of the Shapiro report, which recommended reforming statute of limitations laws, Pennsylvania state Rep. Mark Rozzi — a Democrat who says he was 12 when he was raped in a shower by a priest — renewed his call for doing away with them for filing new criminal charges and civil suits against child sex abusers. As part of what he has dubbed a “Real Deal” bill, Rozzi is also proposing a two-year window for victims of past abuse — like the thousand in the AG’s report — during which they can file claims retroactively. “People are finally outraged to the point that they can’t tolerate it anymore,” Rozzi said. “Victims are finally believed. My fellow legislators get it that it’s their turn to do the right thing now and pass a window. We’ve all had enough.” The powerful Pennsylvania Catholic Conference, the public relations arm of the state's bishops and dioceses, has already made it clear, however, that it will oppose any attempt to get rid of statutes of limitations. Bishop Ronald Gainer of Harrisburg, whose diocese was one of the six cited in the Shapiro report, argued that it would “force the people who make up an organization like the Catholic Church today defend themselves against a crime that was committed in their parish, school or charitable program years ago.” Also, Rozzi is likely to face stiff opposition from the lawmaker who scuttled his earlier attempts — Senate President Pro Tempore Joe Scarnati, a Republican. The wife of Scarnati’s chief of staff, Drew Crompton, works for the Pennsylvania Catholic Conference. So do several of his former staffers, as The New York Times  first reported. This site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service “Many of these crimes were committed numerous years ago and the Church has since instituted desperately needed reforms, however the acts are no less reprehensible,” Scarnati said in a statement after Shapiro’s report was released. Scarnati also touted his own stalled legislation, Senate Bill 261, which would end the statute of limitation on filing future charges against child sex abusers and raise the age threshold for filing civil suits to 50 — but would not allow victims to sue the pedophile priests named in Shapiro’s nearly 900-page report. Asked whether Scarnati’s reluctance to back the two-year window had anything to do with his close ties to the Catholic conference, Crompton said absolutely not. “Senator Scarnati makes his own independent decisions on legislation,” Crompton wrote in an email to NBC News. “He has taken many positions adverse to clients of that lobbying firm over the years. I could give you plenty of examples. He believes the window violates the remedies clause in the (Pennsylvania) constitution and plenty of reputable legal experts agree with him.” When NBC News reached out to the Pennsylvania Catholic Conference seeking an explanation for why it opposes the Rozzi bill, spokeswoman Amy Hill issued the following statement: “We are devastated and outraged by the revelations of terrible sexual abuse crimes committed in the Catholic Church,” she said. “The time to discuss legislation will come later. Our focus now is on improving ways that survivors and their families can recover as they continue through a difficult healing process.” In New York, Cardinal Timothy Dolan went on the radio to register his disgust with what happened in Pennsylvania. “This is not the time for another round of mea culpas,” Dolan said on Sirius XM’s The Catholic Channel. “This is the time, sure, for apologies and contrition, but it’s mostly the time for verifiable, concrete, hard-hitting, no-holds-barred practical attempts to get to the bottom of it and to take steps to see that it does not happen again.” But Dolan did not utter the words “statute of limitations,” which also exists in New York state and which survivors of priest sex abuse like Shaun Dougherty are fighting to abolish through the passage of the Child Victims Act, which would give victims a one-year window to retroactively file claims against their abusers or the Church. Right now, victims of childhood sexual abuse in New York can only seek justice from their alleged predators before they turn 23. Under the proposed act, victims could file civil suits until age 50 and seek criminal charges until 28. The bill would also create a one-year window for victims who are barred by the existing statute of limitations to file civil suits. Dennis Poust, director of communications for the New York State Catholic Conference, called the Pennsylvania report “a gut punch” but said the conference has concerns about the Child Victims Act, known as the CVA. “It’s important to note we do support the complete elimination of the criminal statute of limitations for child sexual abuse, something the Pennsylvania grand jury recommended as well,” he said in an email. “The CVA doesn’t do that. We also agree that the civil statute of limitations is not long enough and we support an extension of the civil statute to give victims significantly more time to sue going forward.” The problem with the one-year window, Poust said, is it that it “opens up old claims going back forever, literally."" “There are no caps on jury awards or how far back it goes, and it is very difficult to defend against something that may have happened in the 1940s or ’50s,” he said. “And the bad actors in those cases, whether abusers themselves or bishops who reassigned them, are long gone.” Poust also said any legislation should “include public schools and municipalities in the window.” The CVA, he said, “protects the teachers unions and public school system from the same retroactive civil lawsuits it wants for the Church.” “We’ve made our share of mistakes, but there is no question that there are many more children abused in public schools than in the Church,” he wrote. “It is fair to argue that the Church should be held to a higher moral standard, but it must not be held to a higher legal standard than the public schools."" Marci Hamilton, a law professor and head of Child USA, a think tank dedicated to preventing child abuse, dismissed Poust’s concerns as the “standard operating woe-is-me response.” “The bad actors are decidedly not in the past,” Hamilton wrote. “No Archdiocese sits on more secrets in the U.S. than NYC where they have traded in the short civil SOLs for decades,"" she added, using an acronym for statutes of limitations. Also, Hamilton added, “it isn’t a proven fact that the public schools have a higher rate of abuse than the church. Indeed, in NY private schools don’t have to report child sex abuse. Only public schools do.” The Catholic Church, insurance companies and other religious organizations that have been hit with abuse allegations, like Agudath Israel, have lobbied hard against the Child Victims Act, Hamilton wrote. But Hamilton said she believes the tide is turning. Most states have either abolished or extended statutes of limitations for the criminal prosecution of child sex abuse. And states like Delaware, Hawaii, Massachusetts and Minnesota have already restored victims’ expired rights to file civil suits. Hamilton said it’s only a matter of time before change comes to major Catholic stronghold states like New York and Pennsylvania. “The bishops thought, for a long time, they were Teflon and none of this would stick to them,” she said. “But it’s increasingly untenable.”"
OVAC;0;1;"The Department of Justice issued subpoenas to Catholic leadership in Pennsylvania on Thursday in following a grand jury report this summer that alleged hundreds of priests in the state molested young children for years. The dioceses of Allentown, Harrisburg, Eerie, Greensburg, Scranton, Pittsburgh and Philadelphia have received subpoenas and intend to cooperate with federal investigators, NBC News confirmed on Thursday with church administrators in each district. A scathing grand jury report from this past August alleged that more than 300 ""predator priests"" were responsible for the sexual abuse of thousands of children in the state of Pennsylvania and that the Roman Catholic church covered up the abuse to avoid scandal.

The federal subpoenas were served a day after Pennsylvania lawmakers failed to push through any reforms to the state’s statute of limitation laws that would enable older clergy sex abuse victims to sue the Catholic Church for damages. Currently, the age cut off for filing civil claims is 30. Pennsylvania Senate President Pro Tempore Joe Scarnati, a Republican and ally of the Church, had been pushing a compromise proposal that would have temporarily lifted the statute of limitations so that older victims could sue individual priests, but not the Church itself. It was opposed by advocates for clergy abuse victims, the Democrats, and State Attorney General John Shapiro. Shapiro had been pushing lawmakers to adopt the recommendations of the grand jury, which called for complete elimination of the criminal statute of limitations for sexually abusing children and creating a two year “civil window” for child sex abuse victims who couldn’t file lawsuits before. Desperate to avoid paying huge settlements, lobbyists for the Catholic Church and the insurance industry have bitterly opposed any changes to the statute of limitations laws. Florida attorney Michael Dolce, who worked to change that state's statutes of limitations for civil and criminal prosecution of child sexual battery, called the Department of Justice's involvement ""breathtaking.""

""It was this other thing that took over. The dark part of him."" ""When he was done, I was so happy that I could walk away from that. I felt like I just escaped something.""

Geddert, who was suspended by USA Gymnastics in January after gymnasts accused him of physical and verbal abuse, did not respond to NBC News' requests for comment. The coach, who is also the subject of an unspecified criminal investigation in Michigan, said in a recent court filing for a Nassar-related lawsuit that he was ""fooled"" by Nassar, a longtime friend. USA Gymnastics said it had no knowledge of the car conversation. It said it first learned of Nassar's ""treatment"" in the summer of 2015 when a coach heard gymnast Maggie Nichols talking about it with Raisman. But elite gymnasts say the abuse goes back to the late 1990s. Allegations that USA Gymnastics figures, including legendary coaches Bela and Marta Karolyi, should have known young athletes were at risk will be explored in Sunday's Dateline investigation, which includes an exclusive interview with the Karolyis. The Karolyis say there is no way they could have known Nassar was molesting the gymnasts they trained. In a statement, USA Gymnastics said it ""denies any allegation that it had wide-ranging knowledge of abuse by Nassar or that it concealed or ignored his abuse."" Maroney was just 13 when she first met Nassar during a national training camp at the Karolyi ranch in a forest an hour outside Houston. He was the national team doctor, a volunteer position he had held since 1996. Maroney knew his name; he was the doctor who kept gold medalists healthy enough to compete. In fact, he was working on an Olympian when he spoke to her for the first time. ""He told me he was going to do a checkup on me, and that was the first day I was abused,"" she said. Nassar told her to go put on shorts with no underwear — an instruction that many of his victims have since recounted. Maroney got on a massage table ""and that's when he did what he would call 'his treatment,'"" she said. I wished my mom was with me. That first time, it lasted a minute. ""I didn't know how to understand what was happening because I felt so lucky to be with him, so it was obviously a very confusing moment,"" she said. ""I wished my mom was with me."" Nassar apparently sensed her unease because he told her she shouldn't mention his technique to anyone and dangled her childhood dream in front of her. ""He said nobody would understand this and the sacrifice that it takes to get to the Olympics,"" Maroney recalled. Maroney said she got ""the treatment"" whenever Nassar saw her. How many times all told? ""Hundreds,"" she said. ""I always felt like Nassar was obsessed with her,"" Raisman said. At the time, she and the others didn't realize that attention was part of the grooming process. And Maroney said what she saw as small kindnesses helped sustain her during the demanding camps, where she was often hungry and aching. Once, she remembered, Nassar bought her a loaf of bread. ""It made me so happy,"" she said. ""I was just like, 'Wow, he really likes me and cares about me. And is trying to make sure that I get to the Olympics.'"" McKayla says Nassar's abuse often took place in a space Karolyi camp attendees called ""the end room."" Nassar would put Maroney's name last on the signup list for post-workout sessions so the other girls would already be back in their rooms, she said. ""He would work on me for like an hour and a half. And just like full abuse… And I'd be crying,"" she said. Privately, she and Raisman and Wieber would mention ""the treatment"" to each other — including the burning they felt from lotion that Nassar, who didn't wear gloves, used on them. The rest of the time, she said, she put on the brave face familiar to competitive athletes. Even after that that horrific night in Tokyo, Maroney turned in one of the best performances of her life, winning gold on the vault at the world championships. And then, she was on the road to the Olympics. All she had to do was stay healthy and for that she relied on one person: Larry Nassar. At the ranch training camp before the 2012 Games, Nassar molested her at least twice a day, she said, and the abuse continued even after the team got to London. On the first day of practice, she injured her foot on a vault, she said. The outcome of an X-ray was to determine if she would be part of the Fierce Five when the competition started or if an alternate would take her place. Nassar, she said, told team coordinator Marta Karolyi that the X-ray showed it was just an old break that had been aggravated. ""He lied so I could stay on the team,"" she said. ""He saved me."" Maroney went on to help Team USA win gold with a near-perfect vault but took silver in the individual because of a fall — a moment that spawned her disappointed smirk on the podium and a viral meme that even President Obama imitated. A year later, she vindicated herself with a gold medal on vault at the world championships in Antwerp, Belgium. It was the last time she saw Nassar at a major competition. ""I was mad at that point. He was still abusing me and it still wasn't clicking in my head to really understand what was happening. But I was so done with it,"" she said. ""There were younger girls and I knew that he was doing it to them, as well."" In the summer of 2015, Maroney got a much clearer understanding of what Nassar had been doing. USA Gymnastics, alerted to Nassar's behavior by a coach, sent a consultant with experience dealing with child sex abuse victims to talk to her. ""And I told her my story,"" Maroney said. Maroney then spoke to the FBI by phone, but he was not arrested for more than a year — a period in which he continued molesting patients at his clinic in Michigan. Maroney, meanwhile, was an emotional wreck, suffering from anxiety and depression. ""I was so sick,"" she said. ""I was having panic attacks. I was suicidal."" Her mother, Erin, has said there were times she feared opening the door to McKayla's room because of what she might find. The family hired an attorney because, they said, they needed money to pay for mental-health treatment. USA Gymnastics settled but included a confidentiality clause in the agreement. Maroney later sued to invalidate the clause and, amid public outrage, USA Gymnastics announced it would not enforce it. After Nassar was unmasked as a predator in September 2016 by the Indianapolis Star, new victims came forward every week. Maroney, though, would not be ready to go public for more than a year. When she did, she posted a searing statement on Twitter and went quiet again. Maroney, 22, said she is speaking now because she doesn't believe the whole story has been told. She wants the world to know that when Nassar was abusing her, no one was watching and that when she tried to tell someone about him six years ago, no action was taken. ""I'm appalled, I'm disgusted. I'm so upset that this happened for so long when there were so many signs and red flags,"" she said. Maroney is retired from gymnastics now and pursuing a singing career. She quit the sport in February 2016, abandoning her goal of a second Olympics. She said that if it weren't for the trauma caused by Nassar, she might have joined her Fierce Five teammates Raisman and Gabby Douglas on the 2016 Final Five squad and won gold again. ""I lost my dream,"" she said. ""That was what I loved to do and what I still would have loved to do. And it was taken away from me."""

OVAC;1;1;"Jared Fogle, the former Subway spokesman, will plead guilty to possessing child pornography and traveling to pay for sex with minors after using ""wealth, status and secrecy"" to prey on his victims, federal prosecutors said Wednesday. The allegations involve 14 minors, and Fogle is accused of engaging in sexual acts with at least one of them, prosecutors said in court documents. In November 2012, he traveled from Indiana to New York City to have sex with a then-17-year-old girl at the Plaza Hotel, according to the documents. He allegedly did so again in January 2013 at another upscale hotel, the Ritz Carlton. The same girl — identified in the documents as Minor Victim 13 — claims she was paid for sex on at least three occasions when she was 16, prosecutors say. Related: Subway's Challenge: How to Erase Jared Fogle From Its Brand As part of a plea deal, prosecutors in the documents asked for a sentence of up to 12 1/2 years behind bars. Fogle has agreed to serve at least five years, but a federal judge has the ultimate discretion. Fogle appeared at a federal courthouse in Indianapolis on Wednesday morning to plead not guilty — a formality as part of the deal, which the judge must still approve. He didn't speak as he exited the building, and was released on an electronic monitoring device. His attorney, Jeremy Margolis, said he will change his plea to guilty and face sentencing at future hearings. No date was immediately set. ""Jared Fogle expects to go to prison,"" Margolis said outside of the court. ""He will do his time. He expects to do well. He expects to make amends to those people whose lives he has affected."" Prosecutors said Fogle's celebrity status as Subway's pitchman for the past 15 years didn't make a difference in the type of plea deal they offered. The case started with a tip from a private citizen, officials said, paving the way for a complex investigation that included looking through more than 16 smartphones, 10 memory cards and 6 laptops. The 14 victims — four of whom are now adults — were identified after police say they reviewed nearly 160,000 text messages, more than 27,000 emails, and tens of thousands of videos and images. This site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service Federal prosecutor Steve DeBrota said some of the victims didn't know who he was, and that he engaged in some of the acts while traveling on business for either Subway or as part of his nonprofit foundation. ""I cannot think of anything more repugnant than sexually victimizing a child,"" Doug Carter, superintendent of the Indiana State Police, said at a news conference. The charges come after federal agents seized computers and DVDs from Fogle's suburban Indianapolis home in July as part of a child pornography investigation involving the ex-head of his nonprofit foundation. Charges against Fogle, a 37-year-old married father of two, had not been announced at that time. The federal documents allege Fogle and Minor Victim 13 arranged to meet through text and online messages, and that Fogle asked her to ""provide him with access to other underage minors for purposes of commercial sexual activity"" and that ""the younger the girl, the better."" Witnesses from Florida, Georgia and Washington state told investigators Fogle also allegedly contacted them to have sex with minors as young as 14 and 15. Related: How Jared Fogle, Suspended Subway Spokesman, Went from Student to Celebrity Fogle faces one count of traveling to engage in illicit sexual conduct with a minor and one count of distribution and receipt of child pornography. In addition to a prison sentence, Fogle must also agree to pay a total of $1.4 million split evenly among the 14 victims, as well as register as a sex offender and undergo treatment for sexual disorder. Margolis said his client has already been examined by a ""world-renowned expert in sexual conditions in order to chart a course to recovery."" The 11-hour sweep of Fogle's Zionsville home followed the arrest of Russell Taylor, the executive director of the Jared Foundation, which works to prevent childhood obesity. Taylor, 43, faces multiple counts of producing and possessing child pornography following a similar raid on his Indianapolis home in April. Investigators said they recovered a thumb drive that included more than 400 videos of child porn and a document with Taylor's employer in the file name, according to a federal criminal complaint. Fogle said in a previous statement that he was shocked at the charges and that his foundation was cutting ties with Taylor. But federal prosecutors say Fogle received child porn from Taylor between 2011 and April 2015, and that Taylor was allegedly using hidden cameras in his residence to film the minors, some as young as 6. ""If Mr. Fogle had done the right thing when he learned of the victimization and reported those to authorities, (the other victims) never would have been victimized,"" DeBrota said. Fogle allegedly received some of the images and videos through text messages and a thumb drive. ""The defendant chose to benefit from production of the nude videos by obtaining access to a significant amount of such material,"" court documents said. Fogle gained national notoriety as a weight loss inspiration after the sandwich chain first featured him in a commercial in 2000. Once a 425-pound undergraduate at Indiana University, Fogle said he began eating at Subway to help him shed 245 pounds. On Wednesday, the company again said it has parted ways with Fogle, calling his alleged actions ""inexcusable."" Jared Fogle’s actions are inexcusable and do not represent our brand’s values. We had already ended our relationship with Jared. Fogle’s wife, Katie, said in a statement Wednesday that she is ""shocked and disappointed by the recent developments,"" and plans to file for divorce.

""Beginning on Jan. 1, prostitution by minors will be legal in California. Yes, you read that right,"" Assemblyman Travis Allen, whose district covers parts of Orange County, wrote Thursday in the conservative D.C. publication the Washington Examiner. Allen's attack on the ""terribly destructive legislation"" has lit up social media — but the intention of the law is not as alarming as he suggests, its supporters say. Senate Bill 1322, which was signed into law by Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown in September, goes into effect on Sunday. ""So teenage girls (and boys) in California will soon be free to have sex in exchange for money without fear of arrest or prosecution,"" Allen wrote. Read my oped that ran in the Washington Examiner today discussing the many harmful California Democrat policies... https://t.co/eJVzKbPlDa SB 1322, he added, ""bars law enforcement from arresting sex workers who are under the age of 18 for soliciting or engaging in prostitution, or loitering with the intent to do so."" This site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service And that's true — the law does state that minors won't be treated as criminals if they are caught under such circumstances. But state Democrats say that distinction was necessary so that the children aren't being blamed or punished for their situation. They are instead to be treated as victims who can be placed into a safe environment by the Department of Social Services, keeping them out of the criminal justice system and potentially off the streets again forced into prostitution, said state Sen. Holly Mitchell, who introduced SB 1322. In his op-ed, Allen acknowledged that Democrats are ""sincere in their belief that decriminalizing underage prostitution is good public policy that will help victims of sex trafficking."" But he said SB 1322 is ""misguided"" because it would theoretically allow pimps who exploit children to continue doing so because the children aren't being adequately removed. ""Simply put, more time on the street and less time in jail means more money for pimps, and more victims for them to exploit,"" Allen wrote. Allen could not be reached Friday for further comment. The law's backers deny that children won't be helped, and say the alternative if they are arrested of juvenile hall again victimizes them. “The law is supposed to protect vulnerable children from adult abuse, yet we brand kids enmeshed in sex-for-pay with a scarlet ‘P’ and leave them subject to shame and prosecution,” Mitchell said in September.

Currently, anyone caught soliciting can be charged with a misdemeanor that might include probation, jail time or a fine. While minors will be exempt from criminal charges under the new law, anyone caught engaging in acts with them will still be subject to prosecution since sex with a minor is considered statutory rape. Various district attorneys' offices in the state have expressed a similar apprehension toward the law —but some say it's because the state just isn't ready to provide adequate services. “Right now, service groups are struggling with what they have in place — there [are] just not enough resources,” Jane Creighton, coordinator of the human trafficking unit at the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office, told the Los Angeles Times in August. “I am not saying these bills should never pass.

OVAC;1;1;"A son of Jerry Sandusky — the former Penn State assistant football coach convicted of molesting a string of boys — was charged Monday with asking minors to send him nude photos and perform a sex act, prosecutors said. Jeff Sandusky, 41, was suspended from his job at the State Correctional Institution in Rockview, Pennsylvania, and held in lieu of $200,000 bail. His attorney did not immediately return a call for comment. An attorney for Jerry Sandusky — who was convicted of 45 sex abuse counts in 2012 and is serving up to 60 years in prison — said he had only just learned of the charges against the son. The two victims, according to court documents, were minors with whom Sandusky had daily contact. In March, he allegedly asked one of them in a text message to send him nude photos. After he was rebuffed, he asked the victim to erase all of the text messages and said they needed to talk, court documents show.

Sandusky also solicited the second victim, a 16-year-old girl, for oral sex in 2013, prosecutors said. He was charged with 12 felonies and two misdemeanors, including solicitation of sex acts and child pornography, unlawful contact with a minor and corruption of a minor. There is no accusation he physically molested either victim. Jeff Sandusky is one of six children adopted by Jerry and Dottie Sandusky. Another son, Matt, has said that he was sexually molested by his father for years.

After his brother's arrest, Matt Sandusky told NBC News that if the allegations are true ""he deserves the maximum of whatever sentence the judge will give him."" ""He should not see the outside of a prison cell for the rest of his life if these allegations are true,"" Matt Sandusky said. ""These people need to be stopped.

OVAC;0;0;"With the New York state Legislature expected to take up a bill that could enable more victims of sex abuse by priests to sue, Cardinal Timothy Dolan is calling for a measure that avoids ""breaking"" the Roman Catholic Church. Dolan, who as archbishop of New York leads more than 2 million Catholics, says he is in favor of a proposed “Child Victims Act” but that such a bill should focus on helping victims. ""The emphasis must be on helping them heal, not breaking government, educational, health, welfare, or religious organizations and institutions,"" Dolan wrote in a op-ed Tuesday in The Daily News. To achieve this, the cardinal said the bill should be modeled on an independent program run by the archdiocese of New York and four other dioceses in the state that has already paid over $200 million in compensation to more than 1,000 people. “The compensation program, which we inaugurated in 2016, works well,” he wrote. Not only does it ensure “fair and reasonable compensation,” he wrote, it prevents the “real possibility — as has happened elsewhere — of bankrupting both public and private organizations, including churches.” Dolan’s words came as the church is faced with the likelihood that the state Senate, now in Democratic hands, could join with the state Assembly and governor to pass a Child Victims Act  that would do away with statutes of limitations that have prevented some alleged abuse victims from suing the church. The bill is sponsored by State Senator Brad Hoylman and Assemblywoman Linda Rosenthal, both Manhattan Democrats. Right now, alleged survivors of abuse cannot file a claim if they are over 23 under New York’s existing statute of limitations, which is among the most restrictive in the country. The bill also includes a one-year “look-back window” that would allow alleged victims who weren't able to sue in the past to file claims. Dolan did not explicitly address the window in his op-ed, but he has objected to it in the past. This site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service “Yes, reservations have been expressed [about] the reliability of claims involving long-past events based on fading memories,” he wrote. “However, our Church’s own experience in abandoning the rigid statute of limitations, although financially expensive, was morally necessary in order to help promote healing and justice for those who deserve it.” Advocates for Catholic sex abuse survivors responded warily, noting that the cardinal did not specifically endorse the version of the bill championed by state Sen. Brad Hoylman, which includes the look-back window. ""No one should be fooled by Cardinal Dolan’s sudden recognition that passing the Child Victims Act (CVA), the vehicle for delivering that justice, is a ‘moral necessity,’"" Rosenthal said in an email to NBC News. ""Cardinal Dolan knows well that the true path to justice for adult survivors lies in the lookback window, in addition to extending the criminal and civil statute of limitations."" Advocates also said that Dolan's emphasis of the bill's broad coverage of a range of organizations that serve minors is a way of ensuring the proposal doesn't pass. “He knows that’s a poison pill,” said David Clohessy of the Survivor’s Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP). “It’s like saying I’m in favor of increasing food stamps but let’s have food stamps for everybody. He knows that will kill it. It’s a very shrewd way of seeming to support a window but including a way to guarantee its failure.” “This is not a change of heart. This is typical Dolan,” Clohessy added. “He doesn’t support a window, he would rather the church handle this internally by paying money and not revealing secrets. That is what they are most afraid of.” Brian Toale, who said he was abused as a child by Catholic priests and lay faculty on Long Island, agreed. “A process that shields institutions from full liability, such as the one Cardinal Dolan suggests, will not offer a practical or moral solution,” he said. Toale also objected to some of Dolan’s language in the op-ed. “For Cardinal Dolan to suggest that children who were abused, whether it be at church or a school, are looking for money and to break religious organizations and institutions is not just ludicrous, it's harmful,"" he said. “Any organizational leader who oversaw the breaking of countless souls, the trust of its flock, and the bodies of children should not assume he knows what survivors want,” Toale said. Dennis Poust, chief spokesman of the New York State Catholic Conference, told NBC News that Dolan was “referring to legislation, not the survivors.” “In his op-ed, Cardinal Dolan is suggesting that there is a better way forward — a Child Victims Act that benefits all child victims and enables them to be compensated for past abuse in a way that avoids costly, time-consuming litigation,” Poust said in an email. “He points to programs initiated by the Catholic dioceses throughout New York State administered by Kenneth Feinberg that have compensated survivors with time-barred claims as one potential model the state could look at.” Pressed on whether Dolan is softening on the one-year look-back window, Poust replied, “It’s fair to say that the cardinal is supporting a version of the Child Victims Act that is victim-centered and would include retroactivity for time barred-claims for all survivors.” Hoylman said he appreciated “the fact that the cardinal is looking forward to working with legislators” but said the “window is nonnegotiable as far as I’m concerned.” “It is the core of what the Child Victim Act is all about,” said Hoylman. “The Republican Senate had blocked consideration for over a decade and we have a new Democratic majority with a chance to really improve the lives of survivors who have been voiceless in Albany because of partisanship. This is a momentous opportunity for survivors and their families and we are not going to negotiate away their chance at justice.” Dolan has called the window “toxic” to the Catholic Church and personally pressed New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who backs the CVA, to cut it out of the bill. But in November, The Daily News reported that the church was “open” to looking at some kind of provision  that would allow victims barred from suing under the statutes of limitations to seek justice. This was ahead of the elections in which the Democrats took control of the legislature — and three months after a bombshell report out of Pennsylvania that named 301 priests as sexual predators and revealed that just two were charged with crimes because of that state’s strict statute of limitations laws.

OVAC;0;1;"Jeffrey Eskridge has spent 42 years dreaming of the moment he’d be able to strike back at the Roman Catholic priest who he says raped him repeatedly as a teenager. He finally got his chance Wednesday with a Child Victims Act lawsuit filed in Kings County Supreme Court in Brooklyn. Hundreds of child sex abuse victims filed lawsuits in New York Wednesday, the first day that the Child Victims Act’s one-year window opened, allowing victims to sue regardless of when the alleged acts happened. The Child Victims Act, which also extends the statute of limitations for criminal charges against child sex abusers, was bitterly opposed by the Catholic Church and other religious groups and blocked for years by Republicans in the state legislature. It covers victims who’ve alleged they were abused as children and teenagers by priests, teachers, scoutmasters and doctors. The group filing suits on Wednesday also included victims of deceased accused child trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. “The revived Child Victims Act cases are critically important cases, raising numerous challenging legal issues, that must be adjudicated as consistently and expeditiously as possible across the State,” Chief Administrative Judge Lawrence K. Marks said in a statement. For Eskridge, the lawsuit is payback for what happened to him at age 15 when the priest who was running the shelter where he was living at the time overpowered him. “I was sleeping in a dorm and he said he would pray over me to get the demons and alcohol out of me,” Eskridge, who now lives in Maryland, told NBC News. “When I pushed him away, he said this is what I need to do to stay here….I was homeless and I had to comply.” Among those filing lawsuits Wednesday was one man who said that he brought his abuse allegations to the attention of Pope John Paul II, who he claims took no action at the time. James Grein, was one of the men whose accusations of sexual abuse resulted in the defrocking of the once powerful Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, said he personally told the late Polish pontiff about the abuse during a 1988 Vatican audience. “He blessed me, he put his hands on me, then he dismissed me,” Grein said during a press conference outside of St. Patrick’s Cathedral in Manhattan. Grein’s claim was also laid out in the complaint he filed in New York Superior Court Wednesday targeting the Archdiocese of New York and the Church of the Blessed Sacrament, a parish in Manhattan where McCarrick once served as vicar. It said Grein was coerced into being McCarrick’s “special boy” and that he was subjected to repeated instances of sexual abuse from age 12 to 17. Asked, in light of his claims that the former pope ignored his allegations, whether John Paul should have been made a saint, Grein answered, ""No."" Grein's lawyer Mitchell Garabedian, who became famous after his efforts to go after pedophile priests in Boston were dramatized in the Oscar-winning movie “Spotlight” was with him at the press conference. This site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service “Take away the robes, take away the religion, and they’re just criminals,” Garabedian said. NBC News reached out for comment about Grein's allegation to the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, which referred a reporter to Joseph Zwilling, the spokesman for the Archdiocese of New York. Zwilling, in turn, urged a reporter to reach out to the Papal Nuncio in Washington, who did not return a call or email for comment on Grein's startling claim about Pope John Paul II. McCarrick was defrocked by Pope Francis earlier this year after a canonical investigation found him guilty of “sins against the Sixth Commandment with minors and with adults.” He was also found guilty in the investigation of soliciting sex during the sacrament of confession. The New York State Court system deployed 45 judges specifically to deal with the onslaught of lawsuits, including a dozen in New York City, public information officer Lucian Chalfen said. “We have a voice today,” Brian Toale, a priest sex abuse survivor who was one of the leaders of the drive to pass the Child Victims Act, said Wednesday outside the Manhattan courthouse. “It used to be one on one against the church, against the Boy Scouts, against other organizations. Today we have a chorus of voices. We are being listened to, we are being heard, we are being believed. There is light at the end of the tunnel and it’s not an oncoming train.” Zwilling said the Archdiocese of New York had been bracing for the onslaught of lawsuits. “While we carefully review the claims made in these suits, we ask that people pray for peace and healing for all those who have suffered from the sin and crime of the sexual abuse of minors, wherever it occurred, particularly victim-survivors and their families,” Zwilling said in a statement. Dennis Poust, director of communications for the New York State Catholic Conference, said “the fiscal impact on the Catholic Church and other organizations won’t become clear for weeks or months.” “Today is a day for survivors to tell their stories and to take an important step on their long journey toward healing,” Poust said in an emailed statement. “The Bishops want to accompany survivors on this journey, to thank them for bravely coming forward, and to again apologize unconditionally for what they endured at the hands of those who so grievously abused their trust. As always, we urge survivors of clergy abuse to go immediately and directly to law enforcement, and also to report the abuse to the diocese where it occurred.” Dozens of less well-known current and former New York priests were also named in lawsuits filed across the state Wednesday. Lawsuits filed by Manhattan attorney Jeff Herman give a snapshot of the kinds of sexual abuse that was buried for decades. The victims in his cases are identified only by their initials because of the stigma and shame. There is B.F., who says he was sexually assaulted starting at age 13 by a Westchester County priest from 1982 to 1983. There is R.G., who said he was an altar boy in the 1980s when he was sexually assaulted by the principal of his Catholic school in Newburgh, New York. There is R.S., who claims a Manhattan priest pulled him out of his Catechism class back in 1957 and sexually assaulted him multiple times when was just 10-years-old. Attorneys from the Marsh Law Firm in Manhattan and the Seattle-based and Pfau, Cochran, Vertelis, Amala law firm, began filing lawsuits after midnight at jurisdictions across New York State. Between the two firms, they represent 550 victims, New York attorney Jennifer Freeman said. Of those, 167 allege they were abused by Catholic priests. “This is a life-changing moment for all New Yorkers who were blocked from bringing their abusers and the institutions that shielded them to justice,” Freeman said. “The powerful institutions who fought this law will soon be held accountable.” Freeman said they are also going to bat on behalf of dozens of other people who are filing sex abuse lawsuits against the Boy Scouts of America and Rockefeller University, which employed a doctor named Reginald Archibald who reportedly abused thousands of children during his 30-year career at the hospital. “Dr. Reginald Archibald may be the most prolific sex abuser in history, after abusing more than a thousand children under the guise of medical research and treatment between 1948 and 1990 at New York City’s Rockefeller University Hospital,” the law firms said in a statement. Archibald died in 2007. “Rockefeller University is committed to acting responsibly and working constructively with former patients of Dr. Archibald,” Rockefeller University said in a statement Wednesday. “We profoundly apologize to his patients who experienced pain and suffering as a result of his reprehensible conduct.” Freeman provided statements from some of the victims her team of lawyers represent, like 60-year-old Raul Diaz, who is suing the Boy Scouts of America. “The abuse I faced as a child has stayed with me for decades as an adult, but that moment at 12:01, when my lawsuit was filed, marked the start of bringing closure for me and many other survivors.” said Diaz, who joined the Boy Scouts at age 10 in 1969 and says he was abused by his scoutmaster during camping trips in New York and New Jersey. In response to the new wave of lawsuits, the BSA released a statement that basically restated the organization's commitment to ""protecting Scouts and upholding our values as an organization."" ""We support retroactive reforms of civil statute of limitations if an organization knowingly concealed or otherwise withheld evidence of wrongdoing,"" it says. ""We also support retroactive statute of limitations reform for claims against individual abusers."" Corky Siemaszko is a senior writer for NBC News Digital."

OVAC;0;0;"The North Carolina man who fired a rifle inside a Washington, D.C., pizzeria as he chased down an internet rumor related to Hillary Clinton was sentenced Thursday to four years behind bars. Edgar Maddison Welch, 28, had pleaded guilty in March to two charges stemming from the Dec. 4 incident at the Comet Ping Pong restaurant. Prosecutors say he was self-investigating an online conspiracy theory — dubbed ""Pizzagate"" — that claimed the pizzeria was harboring a child sex-trafficking ring with connections to influential Democrats. Washington police and the FBI denied the theories had any substance. Federal Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson said Thursday that even though Welch didn't harm anyone, his unsound actions ""literally left psychological wreckage,"" according to The Associated Press. This site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service Jackson added that Welch still went ahead with his ""ill-conceived plot"" when others warned him not to, and that he should have simply contacted law enforcement if he believed the restaurant was engaged in something illicit — instead of driving the more than 4-1/2 hours from his home to the nation's capital to ""rescue"" the nonexistent children. Welch apologized for his actions and told the judge that he ""cannot undo or change what already happened,"" the AP added.

He surrendered peacefully after finding no evidence of sex trafficking. The New York Times reported in November that Pizzagate appeared to have come from the email hacking of Hillary Clinton's former presidential campaign chair, John Podesta, who casually knows the owner.

OVAC;0;1;"The Boy Scouts of America denied Wednesday that it is hiding the names of scout leaders accused of sex abuse from law enforcement and insisted its internal database, which critics have called “perversion files,” is an effective tool to keep predators away from the boys. “We do not keep any reports of suspected abuse secret from the authorities,” Chief Scout Executive Michael Surbaugh said during a conference call with reporters. Surbaugh said the BSA has been maintaining “ineligible volunteer files” since the 1920s, not the 1940s, as has been reported, which have “prevented potential predators from joining our organization.” “They don’t need to be arrested or convicted of a crime to be added to our database,” Surbaugh said. BSA workers and volunteers are required to report to police any abuse accusation, and the suspected abuser is immediately barred from scouting, Surbaugh said. The BSA brass spoke out a day after victim rights lawyer Jeff Anderson charged in a press conference that the venerable organization had the names of 7,819 scout leaders who preyed on boys locked away in its “perversion files” and that it was refusing to make them public. Anderson, also cited testimony by University of Virginia medical school professor Dr. Janet Warren, who revealed in court in January that the organization had tallied 12,254 victims. Warren was testifying in an unrelated child sex abuse case that took place at a Minnesota children’s theater company. At two news conferences Tuesday, Anderson released the names of 180 former scout leaders from New York and New Jersey who had been removed from the organization and whose names appeared in the organization’s files. He used publicly available documents, including legal settlements and news accounts, to compile the list of names. This site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service But Warren, who for five years has been evaluating for the BSA how the group handled sex abuse allegations from 1944 to 2016, defended the organization and insisted she found “no evidence of a coverup.” The BSA’s system has “been in place for over a hundred years and it’s worked very well … even without computers,” Warren said on the conference call. “The rate of instances of reported abuse in the Boy Scouts of America is far less than sex abuse in society as a whole.” Reached by telephone, Anderson said the BSA “was blowing smoke.” “It’s really simple,” he told NBC News. “If they insist they are not hiding anything, then they should release the names and locations of the people they chose to put in the perversion files. It would take just a couple of keystrokes.” Erin Eisner, chief strategy officer for the BSA, insisted it’s not that simple. She said every name in the BSA files has been turned over to police, but they can’t post them publicly because many of the suspects were never charged with crimes. “There are issues of privacy and due process,” she said. That is why, Eisner said, the BSA is pushing for a national database for all “youth-serving organizations that would track adults who have harmed children or who are suspected of harming children.” NBC News and other news outlets first reported the existence of the ""perversion files"" in 2012, when the Scouts released 1,247 cases of known or suspected child abusers in response to a lawsuit by two Portland, Oregon, lawyers. Those files detailed cases from 49 states from 1965 to 1985. And they revealed the hardball tactics that attorneys for the Scouts used to defend the organization, as well as the legal hurdles that scout sex abuse victims — like clergy sex abuse victims — faced when they tried to sue for damages. Later, The Los Angeles Times released a database that tracked 1,900 cases of suspected scout sexual abusers spanning 1947 to 2005. Anderson on Tuesday said he was convinced there were even more cases in the files “that are being held and hoarded at the Boy Scouts of America headquarters.” Eisner denied the BSA was hiding anything. But when asked if the BSA keeps track of scout leaders who have been banished from the program, Eisner admitted they don’t. “We’re not an investigative body, we’re not a quasi-law enforcement body,” she said. But, said Eisner, the names of anybody who either works or volunteers for the BSA are checked against these files. “Our database has served to keep children safe over the years,” she said. Despite that, in recent years the BSA has been hit with numerous lawsuits by former scouts who say they were abused. In December, the BSA warned it was considering filing for Chapter 11 protection. Asked if the BSA has decided to declare bankruptcy, Surbaugh said, “We have made no decision.” Corky Siemaszko is a senior writer for NBC News Digital."
OVAC;0;1;"The Boy Scouts of America are continuing to cover-up a “pedophilia epidemic within their organization,” a group of lawyers alleged Tuesday in a new lawsuit. The Abused in Scouting lawyers said they’ve identified 350 previously unknown scoutmasters and volunteers who allegedly preyed on boys — and whose names were not known to law enforcement or in the BSA’s internal database, which critics have called “perversion files.” “You can’t look at these files and not come to the conclusion that this was a massive problem that was hidden,” attorney Tim Kosnoff said at a press conference. “We know that when a pedophile abuses a victim, it's not just one,” added attorney Stewart Eisenberg. “So each of the 350 abusers have dozens of other victims who have not come forward.” The revelation that the lawyers had identified a small army who they claim are previously unknown scout sex abusers was contained in the lawsuit filed Monday in Philadelphia by a Pennsylvania man identified only as “S.D.” who claims he was assaulted “hundreds” of times over a span of four years in the 1970s. S.D., who lives in Wilkes-Barre, identified his attacker in the lawsuit as Paul Antosh, who also lives in the Pennsylvania city. “I just heard about this lawsuit,” Antosh, 62, told NBC News when reached by phone at the Poconos motel he manages. Asked if the allegations are true, Antosh said, “I’m in the process of hiring counsel.” The complaint also names the Boy Scouts and the Penn Mountains Council. “BSA knew for decades that sexual predators of boys had infiltrated scouting,” the complaint states. This site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service In response to questions from NBC News, the BSA said it was reviewing the spread sheet the Abused in Scouting lawyers sent them and ""continuing to manually search paper records at the local level to see if we can identify more information about the additional alleged perpetrators identified in the plaintiff’s attorneys list."" ""We immediately investigated the limited information provided and our efforts have already resulted in approximately 120 reports to the lead law enforcement agency in each state with an accusation of abuse,"" the BSA said in emailed response. ""We have also contacted local law enforcement for all the cases in which enough information was provided to identify the correct agency."" In a quick review of the Abused in Scouting lawyers' spread sheet, NBC News found that at least half-a-dozen former scout leaders had been previously unmasked as predators and were listed in the BSA's so-called perversion files. NBC News also asked the BSA whether Antosh was still involved in scouting. There was no immediate response to that question from the scouting organization. The BSA, which has been hit with a raft of lawsuits by former scouts who said they were victimized, has acknowledged that it has maintained “ineligible volunteer files” since the 1920s that contained the names of alleged predators. But the organization insists the internal database is a tool designed to keep sexual abusers out of scouting and has denied hiding the names from law enforcement of scout leaders accused of molesting boys. Facing mounting legal costs from defending itself against lawsuits, the venerable nonprofit organization said in 2018 that it began considering filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Founded in 1910 and long considered a bastion of traditional values, the BSA had as of 2016 more than 1.26 million Cub scouts, nearly 830,000 Boy Scouts, and around 960,000 adult volunteers. Abused in Scouting (AIS) consists of lawyers from three different law firms who have banded together to take on the BSA. Speaking at the National Press Club, Eisenberg said the Antosh case is the first of many lawsuits against the BSA to come. He said their 800 or so clients range in age from 14 to 88. Most of the victims are from Texas, where the BSA is based, and states like Florida and North Carolina. “Many of the victims can still recall the smell of the man who crawled into their bag,” said attorney Andrew Van Arsdale. “These are powerful narratives.” Even more troubling, Kosnoff said, just four of the 800 victims “identify the same abuser.” “Everybody else is identifying another abuser,” he said. As for predator scoutmasters, “they’re all over the country” and from a variety of professions, Eisenberg said. Asked if any of the alleged scout abusers are still involved in scouting, Kosnoff said: “We asked the BSA to help us identify these perpetrators. We’ve hit a stone wall with the Boy Scouts.” So the lawyers put out a TV spot in February urging victims to call their offices. “It was slow at first,” Kosnoff said. “But once the phones started ringing, they have not stopped.” Eisenberg called on Congress and local prosecutors to take a closer look at the BSA. He said they would also be happy to share what they have found with local law enforcement. Corky Siemaszko is a senior writer for NBC News Digital."
PVAC;0;1;"Earlier this month, 80 people who said they were sexually abused by one of three doctors — Larry Nassar of Michigan State University, George Tyndall of the University of Southern California and Richard Strauss of Ohio State University — sent a letter to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos with a unified message: Don't give schools more control over how they investigate sexual assault allegations. ""The proposed changes will make schools even less safe for survivors and enable more perpetrators to commit sexual assault in schools without consequence,"" read the letter, which included names of women who attended the three schools. (Nassar is serving a de facto life sentence after pleading guilty to sexual assault and child pornography charges; Tyndall has denied any allegations and has not been charged with a crime; and Strauss died in 2005 before he could be properly investigated.) On Friday, following months of anticipation, DeVos released her proposal for how cases of sexual assault and misconduct should be handled, noting that ""every survivor of sexual violence must be taken seriously, and every student accused of sexual misconduct must know that guilt is not predetermined."" While a 60-day public comment period is now in effect before the plan can be finalized, advocates for sexual assault survivors say they're worried that the guidelines would actually make campuses more dangerous, deter victims from coming forward and put them in traumatizing scenarios. ""It will return schools to a time where rape, assault and harassment were swept under the rug,"" said Jess Davidson, interim executive director of the group End Rape on Campus, adding that the proposal is ""worse than we thought."" The proposal earned a harsh tweet Friday from Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., who warned DeVos that she ""won't get away with what you are doing."" Betsy DeVos, you won’t get away with what you are doing. We are organizing to put an end to your destruction of civil rights protections for students. pic.twitter.com/xHiJrRXW0d The rules involve federal guidelines known as Title IX, which prohibit gender discrimination, including sexual assault, on college campuses as well as in primary and secondary schools. This site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service Advocates for students accused of sexual misconduct have argued that some of the guidance under the Obama administration was unfair to the alleged perpetrators — prompting DeVos last year to rescind Obama's measure and pledge the Education Department would embark on a ""workable, effective and fair system."" But Elizabeth Tang, a legal fellow at the National Women's Law Center in Washington, said the rules under DeVos' new proposals would be harmful to survivors while giving more deference to the accused. Under Obama, the definition of sexual assault was less specific — described as ""unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature."" The new definition would be narrower, requiring actions of misconduct to fall under certain categories, including ""unwelcome conduct on the basis of sex that is so severe, pervasive and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to the school's education program or activity."" The DeVos rules would also require that allegations are reported to officials who have the authority to take ""corrective action,"" such as the school's Title IX coordinator, or for students in grades K-12, to a teacher. Critics point out that some students might feel more comfortable reporting to another adult whom they trust. In addition, the alleged incident would only have to be investigated if it took place on campus or during a school-sponsored event. Critics note that assaults at off-campus parties or outside of bars could effectively be ignored by a school. Once school officials are made aware of an allegation, it must be taken seriously, the guidelines state. But if a school acts ""deliberately indifferent"" toward a case, the Education Department would only have to punish it ""if its response to sexual harassment is clearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstances."" Schools that don't adhere to Title IX requirements risk losing federal funding. In another notable change, accused students will be given the presumption that they're innocent throughout the disciplinary process and have the right to be given all evidence collected against them. In addition, the accused would be able to cross-examine their accusers, although it must be done through a lawyer or representative. ""They're importing a criminal standard for civil rights proceedings. There shouldn't be a presumption one way or another,"" Tang said. ""It only plays into this misconception that survivors are not to be believed and what happened is their fault."" Advocates for sexual assault survivors say it's already difficult to get victims to come forward. According to the National Sexual Violence Resource Center, more than 90 percent of sexual assault victims on college campuses do not report an assault, and 89 percent of U.S. colleges reported zero incidents of rape in 2015 — an incredible statistic that illustrates how many victims likely stay in the shadows, experts say. ""We know it's so difficult to report, but we've especially seen it with the #MeToo stories in the past year, how difficult it can be for even adults,"" Tang said. ""It's indefensible that we subject students and children to such a high bar to get any help from their schools."" DeVos' direction, however, is garnering praise from some individual liberties organizations, men's rights groups and Republican lawmakers who see it as striking a better balance between the rights of the accused and their accusers. We will continue to support survivors. ""The Department's approach seems to balance fairness and support for survivors,"" Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., who chairs the Senate's education committee, said in a statement. The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, a civil liberties group that had criticized the guidance under the Obama administration, said it supports the cross-examination process as well as affording parties involved the opportunity to examine all of the evidence. DeVos' guidelines would ""protect the rights of accused students and uphold the integrity of the process,"" said Samantha Harris, the foundation's vice president for procedural advocacy. But another civil liberties group, the ACLU, surprised some on Friday by tweeting that it is against DeVos' proposed new rules — arguing they ""make schools less safe for survivors of sexual assault and harassment.""

OVAC;0;1;"SALT LAKE CITY — A Utah filmmaker who co-founded the Sundance Film Festival and produced an Oscar-winning movie in the mid-1980s has been charged with sexual abuse of a young girl. Sterling Van Wagenen, 71, is accused of inappropriately touching a girl on two occasions between 2013 and 2015, according to a probable cause statement filed with the charges on April 4. The alleged abuse occurred in two northern Utah cities when the girl was between the ages of 7 and 9, online court records show. Van Wagenen's attorney, Steven Shapiro, declined to comment. Van Wagenen didn't return an email and phone call. He has not yet entered a plea to one count of felony sexual abuse of a child. Van Wagenen co-founded a Utah film festival that came to be known as Sundance Film Festival with Robert Redford and was the Sundance Institute's founding executive director, according to his biography page on the University of Utah website, where he was a part-time instructor until his recent resignation. Sundance Film Festival officials didn't immediately return an email and phone message seeking comment. His affiliation with the organization ended in 1993 when he left the advisory board, The Salt Lake Tribune reported. This site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service Van Wagenen, who posted $75,000 bail, is scheduled to be in court on May 2 for a scheduling hearing. The case was reported to police by child protective services after the girl told her parents about the alleged abuse. Van Wagenen produced the 1985 film, ""The Trip to Bountiful,"" a story of an elderly woman who longs to return to her home that earned the late actress Geraldine Page an Oscar for her starring performance. He also directed the 1992 film ""Alan & Naomi"" about the trauma of the Holocaust on children and was a producer of the 1991 move ""Convicts"" starring Robert Duvall and James Earl Jones. More recently, he was a director of the 2009 documentary called ""Learning from the Light: The Vision of I.M. Pei"" about a well-known architect and an executive director of the 2018 historical tale ""Jane and Emma"" about a black woman's friendship with the wife of Joseph Smith, the founder of The Church of Jesus of Latter-day Saints. Van Wagenen resigned from his part-time instructor position at the University of Utah's Film and Media Arts Department on Feb. 15 after being put on administrative leave on Feb. 5, university spokesman Chris Nelson said. He said the university can't provide any more details other than to say he had worked at the university since October 2012. Van Wagenen's resignation came after a man came forward to accuse Van Wagenen of molesting him as a boy in 1993. No charges have been filed in that case, which was made public by a website that serves as a watchdog for The Church of Jesus of Latter-day Saints, widely known as the Mormon church. The church-owned Brigham Young University in Utah has employed Van Wagenen as an instructor and director of content for its broadcasting arm. University spokeswoman Carri Jenkins didn't immediately return an email and phone message seeking comment. Van Wagenen also periodically worked for the church as a producer and director for many years on a variety of projects, church spokesman Eric Hawkins said. The church wasn't aware of any of Van Wagenen's alleged behaviors until recently and reported them to authorities, Hawkins said. He declined to say if Van Wagenen has been kicked out of the faith, citing church policy to keep personal matters private. The church considers child abuse to be among the most serious sins and that anyone who commits the act should be held accountable, Hawkins said."
OVAC;0;1;"After a remarkable hearing that featured gut-wrenching statements from 156 of his accusers and an apology that the judge said rang hollow, former Olympic gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar was sentenced Wednesday to 40 to 175 years in prison for molesting young girls under the guise of treatment. ""You do not deserve to walk outside of a prison ever again,"" Judge Rosemarie Aquilina said in the Ingham County, Michigan, courtroom where Nassar was forced to listen to victims for seven days before learning his fate. ""I just signed your death warrant,"" she added. Nassar, 54, agreed to a minimum 40-year sentence when he pleaded guilty last year to seven counts of first-degree criminal sexual misconduct in Ingham County. He still faces sentencing in Eaton County for three more counts, and he's already been sentenced to 60 years in federal prison for possession of child pornography. The judge could have given Nassar a stiffer sentence than the one he agreed to, but that would have given him the option of withdrawing his plea and asking for a trial. Related: What's next in the sex-abuse case of gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar? Before the sentence was handed down, Nassar was allowed to speak. Turning to the victims sitting behind him, he tearfully said their statements had shaken him to the core. ""What I am feeling pales in comparison to [your] pain, trauma and emotional destruction,"" he said. ""There are no words to describe the depth and breadth of how sorry I am for what has occurred. An acceptable apology to all of you is impossible to write or convey. ""I will carry your words with me for the rest of my days."" If Nassar thought the statement would earn him sympathy, it failed. This site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service The judge took out a six-page letter he sent the court last week in which he insisted what he had done to the victims ""was medical not sexual,"" that he was a ""good doctor"" and the victim of a media frenzy, and that prosecutors had pressured him to to admit to things he had not done. He complained that his patients had turned on him. ""'Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned,'"" the judge read aloud, her voice full of scorn. She asked him, ""Would you like to withdraw your plea?"" ""No, your honor,"" he said. ""Because you're guilty aren't you?"" she pressed. ""I accept my plea,"" he said. Aquilina said she simply didn't believe that Nassar was owning up to what he pleaded to: penetrating minors with ungloved hands for his own sexual pleasure. ""I wouldn't send my dogs to you, sir,"" she said. After the hearing, some victims found it difficult to put into words their feelings about the sentence. ""It's overwhelming,"" victim Sterling Reithman said after the hearing. ""This whole process has been so long and so difficult, and so to finally have some answers and finally have this all culminate into one day: it's a lot to take in."" Nassar was the team doctor for USA Gymnastics for two decades and had a busy sports medicine practice at Michigan State University — and both institutions have been shaken by criticism for how they handled allegations against him before they became public. On Wednesday night, MSU President Lou Anna K. Simon called the accounts ""tragic, heartbreaking and personally gut-wrenching,"" though she noted that the MSU Board had vouched for her ""integrity and the fact that there is no cover-up."" Nevertheless, despite her support for an investigation into the matter surrounding Nassar's misconduct at MSU, she said she thought it would be best for her to resign. Throughout my career, I have consistently and persistently spoken and worked on behalf of Team MSU,"" she said. ""I have tried to make it not about me. I urge those who have supported my work to understand that I cannot make it about me now. Therefore, I am tendering my resignation as president according to the terms of my employment agreement."" Meanwhile, USA Gymnastics said it supported Nassar's sentence and any further investigation. ""USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that may shine light on how abuse of the proportion described so courageously by the survivors of Larry Nassar could have gone undetected for so long and embraces any necessary and appropriate changes,"" the organization said. ""USA Gymnastics and the [United States Olympic Committee] have the same goal — making the sport of gymnastics, and others, as safe as possible for athletes to follow their dreams in a safe, positive and empowered environment."" An investigation by The Indianapolis Star in September 2016 first disclosed Nassar had been accused by two former patients of sexually assaulting them under the guise of medical treatments, penetrating them with ungloved hands without their permission. That unleashed a flood of horrifyingly similar allegations. Nassar pleaded not guilty to all charges and his lawyers insisted his procedures were legitimate, but most of his defenders vanished after the child pornography was found — and he ultimately changed all his pleas. A year later, some of the most famous names in gymnastics were added to the list: McKayla Maroney, Aly Raisman and Gabby Douglas from the 2012 ""Fierce Five"" Olympics team. Simone Biles, who won gold in 2016, said last week that she also had been abused by Nassar, and Jordyn Wieber of the 2012 team revealed her story at the sentencing hearing. Although Nassar admitted he molested seven girls — including a family friend, starting when she was 6 — the judge allowed all accusers to speak before she announced the penalty. She could not have imagined the result: a wall-to-wall outpouring of anger, grief, and demands for accountability from world-famous athletes to unknown teenagers. ""I feel nauseous even standing in front of you,"" 18-year-old Kaylee Lorincz told Nassar, who sat in the witness box crying. ""Like the feeling as if I'm being assaulted by you all over again."" Lorincz, who said she was 13 when her innocence was stolen, told Nassar she didn't need an apology. What she and the other victims wanted, she said, was accountability from the institutions that employed him. ""I only hope that when you get a chance to speak, you tell us who knew what and when they knew it,"" she said. ""If you truly want us to heal, you will do this for us."" A day earlier, Brooke Hylek offered another suggestion to Nassar. ""Enjoy hell,"" she said."
PVAC;0;1;"Jennifer Araoz says she was 14 years old when a young woman approached her outside her New York City high school in the fall of 2001. The woman was friendly and curious, asking Araoz personal questions about her family, her upbringing, their finances. Soon she began talking to Araoz about a man she knew who was kind and wealthy and lived nearby. His name, the woman said, was Jeffrey Epstein. The first few times she went to Epstein's Manhattan townhouse, all they did was talk, Araoz said, and the friendly woman came along. Araoz told him about her dream of becoming a Broadway actress and about her father, who had died of AIDS when she was 12. But on Araoz's first visit without the woman, Epstein gave her a tour of his mansion that culminated in a visit to what he described as his ""favorite room in the house,"" Araoz said. A massage table sat on the floor. A painting of a nude young woman hung from the wall. Araoz would return to that room regularly over the next year, she said, manipulated into stripping down to her panties and giving Epstein massages that ended with him pleasuring himself to completion and her leaving with $300. In the fall of 2002, Epstein pressured her to do more, Araoz said. He told her to remove her panties. Then he grabbed her 15-year-old body. ""He raped me, forcefully raped me,"" Araoz told NBC News in an exclusive interview. ""He knew exactly what he was doing."" ""I was terrified, and I was telling him to stop. 'Please stop,'"" Araoz, now 32, added. Epstein, Araoz said, ignored her pleas. She never returned to his home after that day and her life spiraled downward over the next several years as a result of the trauma, she said. Epstein, 66, was charged Monday with operating a sex trafficking ring in New York and Florida between 2002 and 2005. Federal prosecutors in New York say the wealthy financier, who has socialized with the likes of Donald Trump, former President Bill Clinton and Britain's Prince Andrew, sexually abused dozens of minors and paid his victims to recruit others, allowing him to build a vast network of girls to exploit. He entered a plea of not guilty. Araoz's account adds a new dimension to the allegations against Epstein: a young girl being recruited outside a New York City school to perform sexual favors for him. The federal indictment unsealed this week refers to three unidentified victims but none of them is Araoz. She never contacted the authorities to tell her story, but she says she did tell at least four people — her mother, her old boyfriend and two close friends — about the Epstein encounters several years after they occurred. Reached by NBC News, all four confirmed that she told them years ago that she had been sexually assaulted by Epstein. ""She said that she was raped by Epstein and before the rape she had been giving him massages for a year,"" a friend of 16 years said. ""There's no doubt in my mind knowing her character, the type of person she is, that what she says happened is exactly what happened."" Epstein's lawyers did not respond to multiple requests for comment. This isn’t the first time that Epstein has been accused of preying on young girls. He signed a controversial non-prosecution deal in 2007 that allowed him to dodge a federal indictment alleging he abused several underage girls. Epstein, who ultimately pleaded guilty to state charges of soliciting minors for prostitution, has maintained that his encounters with the alleged victims were consensual and that he believed they were 18 when they took place. From the start, Araoz says she loved her high school. The Talent Unlimited High School was a small, specialized school for the performing arts located on E. 68th St. on Manhattan's Upper East Side. It seemed a perfect fit for Araoz, who longed for a career in theater. She grew up in Queens in a household that had little money. The death of her father, when she was in middle school, took an especially heavy toll. ""I was a little bitter,"" Araoz said. ""I felt a little cheated in life."" It was early in her freshman year when Araoz says a brunette in her 20s approached her outside school. She was easy to talk to, and Araoz spoke freely about her struggles and her dreams. ""I was kind of a lost kid and she sensed it,"" Araoz said. They had chatted a few times before the young woman ever brought up Epstein's name. She said he believed in helping people and was already supporting her and her family, Araoz said. ""She was saying he's very powerful, he's very wealthy, he's a great guy,"" Araoz recalled. ""He's almost like a fatherly figure to her, which had meaning for me at that time because I was maybe longing for that."" Araoz said the woman showed up outside her school multiple times and even offered to buy her a soda or lunch nearby. ""She was definitely trying to get to know me,"" Araoz said. Araoz eventually agreed to accompany the woman on a visit to Epstein's home. His townhouse, located less than 10 blocks from her school, was as impressive as the woman had described. Vast ceilings, marble stairs, artwork covering the walls. ""It looked like a museum,"" Araoz said. There was a bank of cameras near the front entrance, with mini TV screens showing who was coming and going, she said. A secretary's office was off to the left. Up the hall to the right, there was a cavernous room filled with exotic animal trophies. Araoz recalled seeing a stuffed lion, tiger, even a giraffe — as well as the skins of other animals draped across the floor. The 14-year-old Araoz and the woman who'd brought her to the townhouse were offered wine and cheese by a member of the staff as they waited for Epstein. When he did show up to greet the pair, he was warm and welcoming, Araoz said. This site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service She recalls him telling her that he had heard a lot about her and felt terrible about her father's death. Epstein insinuated that Araoz was ""very lucky to have met somebody like him"" and ""that he could really help me,"" she said. Before they left, Epstein gifted the woman who'd brought Araoz to the townhouse a brand new digital camera. His secretary handed Araoz $300 in cash, she said. She returned a handful of times with the woman, and left after each visit with $300, Araoz said. Epstein talked about donating money to AIDS charities, which struck a chord for her given her father's death, and wanting to help with her career. He talked up his contacts in the acting business and mentioned that he owned a modeling agency. Araoz recalls him telling her that ""I should be a model and all these things that young girls like to hear."" ""There was nothing not to trust at that time,"" Araoz said. ""He was giving me $300, which was a big help for me."" The joint visits continued for about a month, she said. By then, she felt comfortable enough with him to go on her own. ""I thought it was maybe a little odd because I didn't know what he necessarily was getting out of it,"" said Araoz, who could not recall the recruiter's name. ""But I said, 'This is a genuinely really nice guy, (a) good man who wants to help me.'"" But the dynamic changed that first time she showed up alone, Araoz said. Instead of talking downstairs, Epstein escorted his 14-year-old visitor onto his elevator and brought her deeper into his seven-story home. ""All the rooms were very grand and had a lot of artwork, a lot of murals on the walls,"" Araoz said. He showed her an oval-shaped room with blue walls and likened it to ""his favorite room in the White House"" — an apparent reference to the Oval Office. She also saw a bathroom with a tub and a set of prosthetic breasts within arm's length. ""It was very odd,"" Araoz said. She said they ended up in a small room with a massage table and a bathroom off to the side. A large Sistine Chapel-like mural depicting angels against a blue sky hung on one wall. A painting of a nude young woman with brown hair clung to another, she said. ""When he first brought me up there, he was like, 'You know, you remind me so much of this woman in the painting,'"" Araoz said. Epstein asked her if she was good at massages, she said. She wasn't sure how to answer but she eventually agreed to strip down to her underwear and rub his bare back. Araoz said she thought it was strange but she also didn't feel comfortable saying no to him. ""I felt almost obligated because of the money he was giving me,"" she said. ""I didn't know if he would get angry or if I didn't listen what the repercussions would have been,"" Araoz added. ""So I kind of just followed. I was so young, so I didn't know better."" Like the others that followed, the massage began innocently. But it didn't stay that way, she said. Epstein would turn over, Araoz said, and ""play with himself."" ""He would also like when I would play with his nipples. He used to get turned on by that. And then he would finish himself off and then that would be the end of it."" Over the next several months, Araoz's visits followed a familiar routine. Epstein's secretary would contact her by email, beeper or her family's landline to set up a meeting, Araoz said. When she arrived, she'd be escorted to the elevator and head straight to the massage room. ""It was just such a big help, the money,"" Araoz said. ""And I said, 'I'm not really doing anything that wrong.'"" During the visits, Epstein showered her with compliments about her appearance, Araoz said, emphasizing how much he loved women with smaller breasts. He also reiterated his promises to jump-start her acting or modeling career, she said. Araoz said that she had told the recruiter that she was 14 and mentioned it in Epstein's presence. ""He knew exactly who he was hanging out with,"" Araoz said. ""I don't think he cared."" Araoz said she performed the massages once or twice a week for the duration of her freshman year. But one day at the beginning of her sophomore year, Epstein got violent with her, Araoz said. While she was giving him a massage, Epstein first asked a question that Araoz took to be more of a demand. ""Why don't we try something a little bit different?"" she recalls him saying. ""Why don't you do the massage on top of me?"" Araoz said she told him that she wanted to ""stick to the normal routine,"" but she ultimately removed her underwear. He fondled her privates, she said. Then he ""brought me up there and it was very aggressive, it was forceful,"" she said. Araoz said she was terrified and told him to stop. ""He was like, 'It's okay. You're fine. You're not doing anything wrong,'"" added Araoz, who said he did not use a condom. After it was over, Araoz said, she rushed out of the house angry and shaken. Her life unraveled over the next few months. She developed crippling anxiety. She suffered panic attacks. She dropped out of school to avoid having to return to his neighborhood — and eventually gave up on her dream of becoming an actress. But Araoz didn't tell anyone about the source of her torment — at least not initially. ""I kind of hated myself for it,"" Araoz said. ""I was like, 'I'm stupid, I should have known better. I'm a bad kid.'"" ""I basically just tried to forget about it and live my life,"" she said. Araoz said Epstein and his associates tried to contact her but she never responded to the messages or spoke to him ever again. She said it wasn't until several years later that she confided in her boyfriend at the time, and subsequently told her mother and at least two close friends. The boyfriend, who asked to remain anonymous, told NBC News she revealed to him in 2008 that Epstein had abused her. Araoz's mother also told NBC News that her daughter told her about the abuse around the same time. The mother, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said she noticed a change in her daughter's behavior and appearance around 2002. Araoz lost weight, became withdrawn and was frequently angry, her mother said. ""I was really scared,"" the mother said. ""She was so anxious but I couldn't figure out why. The anxiety got so bad that she couldn't function and I urged her to go to a doctor."" A close male friend told NBC News that Araoz confided in him about the abuse roughly five or six years ago. And a female friend of 16 years said Araoz was crying and blaming herself when she confided in the friend about a decade ago. ""I think she had to get it off her chest,"" the friend said. Araoz is now a makeup artist living not far from her childhood home in Queens. She said she's still grappling with the emotional damage of her teenage encounters with Epstein. ""He took something from me that can never be repaired, never made whole,"" Araoz said. The charges against Epstein were brought more than a decade after Florida prosecutors cut the controversial deal that allowed him to dodge the prospect of a lengthy federal prison sentence for allegedly preying on underage girls. Epstein was under investigation and facing possible federal prosecution for allegedly sexually abusing several minor girls, court records show, a case that could have put him behind bars for years. Instead, he pleaded guilty to state charges of soliciting a minor for prostitution. He served 13 months at Palm Beach county jail and was allowed to leave the facility six days a week for work. He was also required to register as a sex offender. The new indictment has ignited fresh criticism of Labor Secretary Alex Acosta, who was the U.S. attorney in Miami at the time. Acosta, who has long defended the deal, did so again Monday. ""With the evidence available more than a decade ago, federal prosecutors insisted that Epstein go to jail, register as a sex offender and put the world on notice that he was a sexual predator,"" he tweeted. ""The crimes committed by Epstein are horrific, and I am pleased that NY prosecutors are moving forward with a case based on new evidence."" Epstein is facing up to 45 years in prison if convicted on the new charges of sex trafficking and conspiracy. Mimi Rocah, an NBC News legal analyst who served as a former assistant U.S. attorney in New York, said any new allegations against Epstein could lead to additional federal counts. Child sex victims must be under the age of 28 to pursue state charges in New York. At a press conference Monday, Geoffrey Berman, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, urged any other Epstein victims to contact the FBI. Araoz said she hopes Epstein spends the rest of his life in prison, and is willing to testify in court if called upon by federal prosecutors. ""He shouldn't be on the streets anymore, period,"" she said. When asked why she didn't contact the authorities about the alleged assault, Araoz said she feared the repercussions. ""I was so young that I was worried that somehow I would get in trouble,"" Araoz said. ""I was really frightened of Epstein. He knew a lot of powerful people and I didn't know what he could do to me, and I wasn't sure that anyone could protect me."" Araoz's legal team filed papers in New York state court Wednesday seeking more information from Epstein prior to filing her civil complaint. Her lawyers contacted Epstein's attorneys this past March seeking an out-of-court settlement but the talks broke down, Araoz's lawyer said. ""He injured her grievously,"" said one of Araoz's lawyers, Daniel Kaiser. ""She suffered a horrific event that altered the course of her life forever."" Attorney Kimberly Lerner, who is also representing Araoz, added: ""Jennifer is no longer the scared 14-year-old child who was victimized by Jeffrey Epstein. Today, she is the brave young woman telling her story to let all the other victims know that they are not alone."" Araoz said she's finally summoned the strength to speak out now to help prevent other young girls from falling into the clutches of predatory men. But she still harbors guilt over not doing so earlier. ""What hurts me even more so is that if I wasn't afraid to come forward sooner, then maybe he wouldn't have done it to other girls,"" Araoz said.

PVAC;0;1;An 11-year-old girl who was allegedly raped by her brother gave birth at home, and now he and their parents are facing criminal charges. The girl gave birth to a boy in a bathtub in St. Charles, Missouri, according to a probable cause statement.  Her biological brother, who is 17, was charged last week with incest, statutory rape and statutory sodomy of a person younger than 12, while her parents were charged with child endangerment. Police say the girl's parents did not provide medical care to their daughter after she gave birth. This site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service NBC News is not naming the girl's parents or brother because it would identify the victim. Police started investigating on Feb. 11 after the girl's parents brought a baby boy to a hospital. The baby still had the umbilical cord and placenta attached and a body temperature of 90 degrees, according to a probable cause statement. The girl's father initially claimed the baby was his and had been dropped off on their porch by an ex-girlfriend. He later told investigators his daughter had given birth to the boy and that his son was the father, a probable cause statement states. The girl's parents claimed they were not aware she was pregnant or that she was allegedly being sexually assaulted by her brother, according to the statement. During questioning, the brother told police he had sex with his sister about 100 times but did not know she was pregnant, according to a probable cause statement. He also said he did not know how long it had been going on for, the statement said. All three suspects are being held by the St. Charles County Department of Corrections, a jail official told NBC News Friday. Bail was set at $10,000 for the woman, $100,000 cash only for the man and $300,000 cash only for the teen, according to court records. No attorneys are listed for them in online court records. The baby, who was born premature, remains hospitalized, and the girl is in the care of relatives, St. Charles police Lt. Tom Wilkison told NBC News.

OVAC;0;1;"A 6-year-old Missouri boy was led to believe he'd been kidnapped, shown a gun, and threatened with being sold into ""sex slavery"" — and it was all part of an alleged plot to teach the boy a lesson because he was “too nice” to strangers, authorities said. Deputies from the Lincoln County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday first questioned the boy’s aunt, mother, grandmother and a 23-year-old man for their alleged roles in child’s four-hour ordeal on Monday, the sheriff’s office said. This site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service The sheriff’s office said the boy’s aunt, Denise Kroutil, 38, enlisted the help of a co-worker, Nathan Wynn Firoved, 23, to stage a kidnapping to scare the child, and that the boy’s mother, Elizabeth Hupp, 25, and grandmother, Rose Brewer, 58, agreed with the scheme. On Monday, Firoved allegedly kidnapped the child after he got off a school bus and said he would never ""see his mommy again,"" authorities said. Firoved also showed a handgun to the now-sobbing boy, then drove around in his truck, and finally tied him up and covered his face with a jacket when the child wouldn’t stop crying. The blindfolded child was then taken to family's home, put in the basement, and his aunt allegedly removed the child’s pants and told him he could be sold into ""sex slavery,"" the sheriff’s office said. The boy was eventually led upstairs and lectured about the dangers strangers could pose. Family members told deputies Wednesday they only wanted to educate the boy, according to the sheriff’s office. The sheriff’s office said in a statement that the boy was ""terrorized."" All four were charged Thursday with felony kidnapping and child abuse, and were being held in lieu of $250,000 bail, according to police and court records. Firoved, Brewer and Kroutil were also charged with felonious restraint. Court records online did not list attorneys for any of the four. Attempts to contact family members were unsuccessful. Deputies were called to the home Wednesday after the boy told officials at school, and they contacted the state Division of Family Services, the sheriff’s office said. The child was taken from the home."
