25 May 2016,Fugitive child rapist arrested in Brazil,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-stoke-staffordshire-36380291,"A child rapist who fled the UK has been arrested in Brazil after three years on the run. Portuguese national Antonio Pedro De Olivera Alves, 44, was convicted in his absence at Stafford Crown Court of raping the 12-year-old girl. He was sentenced to an 11-year jail term in 2013, and a warrant for his arrest was issued. Alves, who was arrested in South America earlier this month, will face extradition proceedings, police said. More on this and other Staffordshire stories Prior to raping the girl, Alves befriended her by posing as a teenager. He was charged in January 2013 and convicted in June the same year. Staffordshire Police worked with the UK National Crime Agency and Brazilian authorities to catch Alves, who was arrested earlier this month. He will remain in custody until the Brazil High Court rules on his expected extradition to the UK, said police. At the time of arrest, Alves lived at Aneurin Bevan Place in Rugeley and worked in Stafford."
31 May 2014,Brazil child sex trade alarm as World Cup nears, https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-27645921,"Joana Maranhao is, by anybody's reckoning, a remarkable young woman.  She is a world-class swimmer who represented Brazil at three consecutive Olympic Games and is one of the country's most successful and prominent female athletes. Joana retired from swimming after the last Olympic Games in London, partly because she felt she could no longer compete at the top level and partly because she has a new battle to fight. As a child Joana was repeatedly sexually abused over many years in a country and, in particular, a region where the issue is rarely talked about and where offenders are rarely prosecuted. ""When a child is raped or abused here, even if there's an investigation, the way it happens is never sympathetic to the victim,"" says Joana at her apartment in the northern city of Recife. Joana was abused by someone she knew and trusted but that's not always the case.  ""It's worse for poor kids in this region,"" Joana tells me.  ""But it's not about how poor or rich you are. Here it was almost seen as normal and the police have nowhere near enough people to investigate."" Joana's ""new race"" - as she puts it - is her charity and campaign group, ""Infancia Livre"" (Free Childhood).  She's determined to help young people, many without the education and drive that she has, who are victims of abuse in a part of Brazil that has a terrible reputation and record for protecting its youth. Recife, and the wider coastal region in the northern state of Pernambuco, is one of the fastest growing regions in Brazil. With its long white beaches it's an increasingly popular destination and where four football World Cup games will be played his summer.  Economic growth has brought thousands of workers here from other parts of Brazil and overseas. But according to aid workers these areas are also frequented by men looking for sex, and that's often sex with children. Just a block from the beach, as music blares from the open boot of a car, men stand around drinking and watching a group of women a few yards away.  This is the city's red light district but the difference here is that while they may dress and make themselves up like women some of these girls are only just in their teens. One in four sex workers here is thought to be a child. Aginaide Lynch is a co-ordinator for the Happy Child charity here in Recife.  She works with street children or those caught up in the sex trade. They have a safe house and other centres in the city dedicated to trying to turn lives around but she admits that with minimal official help and facing such overwhelming challenges, it's just a drop in the ocean. ""In this region, the north-east, people come here specifically for this and it'll get worse during the cup,"" says Ms Lynch. She says that for the so-called ""sex tourists"", it's ""easy and formalised"". ""Even when men arrive at the airport, taxi drivers or hotel staff help them to find girls. The police are usually absent or even compliant in the business of child abuse so we have to take care of the problem ourselves and get the kids off the streets."" It's not always girls and boys from the streets, with drugs addictions and absent family structures, that fall victim to the sex tourists. Pregnant at 16, Ana's own childhood is already lost. She's not a prostitute but has been having sex since she was 12.  Ana - not her real name - says girls here go with foreigners because they are wealthy and generous. Ana is from a working class background and, although her dad no longer lives at home, her mother clearly cares about her daughter's plight. But when, exasperated, her mum went to the police, they didn't even recognise Anna as a victim.  ""I've got lots of friend who go with foreigners - gringos. They come here for the girls, you know - working girls, Ana tells me as she sits surrounded by baby clothes, six months into her pregnancy.  She's clearly too young and too vulnerable for the situation she's in but shrugs her shoulders and says: ""The guys have lots of money and give the girls loads of things like a place to live or jewellery."" The laws in Brazil regarding child abuse are, on paper at least, relatively strong.  Joana Maranhao's revelations about her past and her willingness to speak out have even led to a new law, in her name, extending the time by which perpetrators of crimes against children can be prosecuted. But it's not enough and, especially here in the north of the country, there are cultural barriers to break down as well as legal ones. Brazilian society is often accused of sexualising children. The Novina phenomenon, where internet videos and songs portray young girls as attainable, sexual objects, is strong in this region. Jessica Barbosa is from the British charity Action Aid, which has several projects running in the area. In these poor areas, children are particularly vulnerable to the attentions of men with money and promises. ""It's a situation that we think is going to be worse in the World Cup because we have men from outside,"" she says.  ""We have vulnerable girls who need money and who think they'll have a better life in other countries. And we have no serious public policies to prevent this situation.""  Twelve-year-old Andrea is proof of that.  She has not been abused but only thanks to her mother's vigilance. She tells me how she's unable to rely on the law to stop older men harassing or trying to lure her daughter with gifts from clothes to popcorn.  So she's had to make her a virtual prisoner in her own home. A high-profile global campaign, called ""It's a Penalty"" and fronted by English and Brazilian footballers, warns World Cup visitors not to take advantage of Brazil's reputation for easy sex.  In this World Cup city, kids high on drugs sell themselves for the price of a cup of coffee.  It's an ugly business that embarrasses Brazil when the country is showing itself off to the world."
20 April 2012,Iranian diplomat accused of Brazil child molestation, http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-17780497,"Brazil says it will seek an explanation from Iran after an Iranian diplomat was accused of molesting underage girls at a swimming pool in Brasilia.  The Iranian official was questioned by police following complaints from parents but released after invoking diplomatic immunity.  Iran's embassy denied the allegations, and said they were the result of a ""cultural misunderstanding"".  Brazilian Foreign Minister Antonio Patriota called them ""very worrying"".  The un-named Iranian diplomat was accused of inappropriately touching girls between 9 and 15 years old at a pool in a private club last weekend, Brazilian media reported.  The father of one of the girls told the G1 website that the diplomat was almost lynched by angry parents before security staff intervened.  ""People wanted to kill him,"" the unnamed father said.  The Iranian embassy said the allegations were the result of ""a misunderstanding resulting from differences in cultural behaviour"".  It also accused the Brazilian media of deliberately sensationalising the incident.  But Brazilian Foreign Minister Antonio Patriota said he was taking the allegations very seriously and would ask the Iranian embassy for clarification before deciding what action to take.  ""Personally I would consider it unacceptable if any Brazilian diplomat conducted himself in this manner in the country in which he was accredited,"" Mr Patriota said. "

21 August 2020,John Dickinson: Murderer jailed again for child sex offences, https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-53868572,"A man who strangled a woman to death in 1980 has been jailed again for historical child sex offences. John Dickinson, 67, spent 34 years in prison for Susan Lowson's murder and was released in 2014. In September 2019 he was convicted by a jury of sexually abusing two children in the 1970s, who were aged between three and six at the time. He was sentenced at Cambridge Crown Court to 18 years in prison with an extended license period of four years. Dickinson was found guilty of three counts of indecency with a child, three counts of indecent assault on a female, one count of indecent assault on a male and another count of indecent assault. Judge Jonathan Cooper told Dickinson the abuse he inflicted on the children ""has haunted them for their entire adult lives"". The offences took place in Hertfordshire and the judge said the children were ""serially and relentlessly abused"". The abuse occurred before he murdered Ms Lowson in Stevenage in 1980, for which he received a life sentence. Dickinson was also sentenced earlier for admitting the purchase of a stun gun in December 2018, which police had intercepted in a package destined for his home. The court heard Dickinson maintained it ""had been bought to help you free yourself from [a] blackmailer"", a claim Judge Cooper rejected. Fiona Peters, from Hertfordshire Constabulary, said: ""John Dickinson has finally been punished for these hideous crimes committed against extremely young children. ""Dickinson subjected these children to sustained periods of abuse when they were at a very vulnerable age, betraying their trust in him.  ""They have shown great courage in coming forward and giving evidence in this case, which has secured this conviction. I commend them for their bravery.""

7 August 2020,Eric Joyce: Ex-Labour MP sentenced for child sex offence, https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-suffolk-53694012,"A former Labour MP and ex-Army officer who admitted making an indecent image of a child has been sentenced. Eric Joyce had a 51-second film on a device that showed ""the sexual abuse of very young children"", Ipswich Crown Court heard. The former shadow minister and ex-MP for Falkirk was arrested in 2018.  Joyce, 59, of Worlingworth, Suffolk, was sentenced to eight months in prison suspended for two years, and must complete 150 hours of unpaid work. The court heard the category A film - the most serious there is - was accessed by Joyce between August 2013 and November 2018. It featured what appeared to be seven different children, aged between 12 months and seven years. Judge Mr Justice Edis said: ""That these acts of abuse happened is because there are people like you who want to watch these films. ""If there was no market, those children wouldn't be subjected to these very serious offences."" The judge said Joyce had ""sought help"" and there was evidence he had been able to ""reduce, perhaps completely"" his ""impulsive behaviour"". Michael Proctor, prosecuting, said a number of computer devices and hard drives were seized by police from Joyce's address in November 2018 following intelligence. Initially Joyce told police ""he had never seen child abuse material"", Mr Proctor said. But following analysis of his computer, Joyce told police that some of what he said ""wasn't true"" and that ""he had seen a mixture of images"". The prosecution said there was evidence of searches ""for material for five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10-year-old girls"". Joyce served as a Labour MP from 2000 to 2012, before sitting as an independent until 2015.  He originally joined the Army in 1977 before serving for 21 years, during which he rose to the rank of major. The court heard his previous convictions included drink-driving, common assaults and a public order offence. Mitigating, Mark Shelley said Joyce had no previous convictions for sexual offences and that he had given up drinking. Joyce also received a sexual harm prevention order, was given an 18-day rehabilitation activity requirement and ordered to pay prosecution costs of £1,800."

Alex Kear, 50, represents the Airedale and Ferry Fryston ward as an independent on Wakefield Council in West Yorkshire. He pleaded guilty at Leeds Crown Court to the charges, both involving a child under the age of 13, on Thursday. Labour councillor Michael Graham said Kear should ""step down immediately"". Kear, a former Labour member, will be sentenced on 20 August after admitting offences of trying to entice a child under the age of 13 into engaging in sexual activity and attempting to incite a child into pornography.
